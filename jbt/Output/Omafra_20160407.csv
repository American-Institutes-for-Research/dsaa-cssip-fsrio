This information could form the basis for further discussion about prudent use of drugs in dairy cattle and help the industry address future consumer concerns regarding the safety of dairy food products. This study will identify management and husbandry practices that are critical to realizing the full potential of these design features. With the current industry trend towards larger herd size and free-stalling housing, it is important to understand the health implications of different design options. Lower drug residue risk and lower risk of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria complements this list of benefits."
