"123466"	"Vitamin D fortification of foods"	"2011"	"2014"	"Vitamin D is the term used to describe two molecules, ergocalciferol (vitamin D2, derived by UV irradiation of the ergosterol that is widely distributed in plants and other fungi) and cholecalciferol (vitamin D3, formed from the action of UV irradiation on the skin). Poor vitamin D status is a very common problem in the UK. This has important health consequences (such as muscle/bone function, increasing the risk of diabetes). This project is directly comparing the biological effects of vitamin D2 vs. vitamin D3 in fortified foods of different matrices (i.e. a solid vs. liquid food) using a dose of vitamin D that is realistic and relevant to the food industry (600IU/15µg per day). It will examine responses in Caucasians and South Asians, and explore 'systems' level (genetic/enzymatic) differences in potential responses to vitamin D fortification.

"124487"	"Novel processing of flour and starch"	"2011"	"2015"	"The functionality of wheat flour is determined by its physical properties and chemical composition. For example, swelling power and gelatinization temperature of wheat flour are highly dependent on the content and composition of components associated with starch such as proteins and lipids. Wheat flour is used as an ingredient in a multitude of food products such as breads, biscuits, cakes, batters, soups, sauces and coatings. While flour milling (the primary process) may be considered a mature technology, there has been less focus on developing secondary processing technologies to modify the functionality of flour (with the exception of heat treatment). Instead, processors tend to rely on the addition of ingredients and additives. The objective of this study is to gain a deeper understanding of the potential to modify flour functionality through modification of the base chemistry. The initial focus will be on selective modification of the lipid profile of flours. A second focus will be to modify the starch properties of flour. Studying these areas in more detail in a range of baked products will complement the already well developed understanding of the role of proteins in flour quality and functionality.

"126707"	"Protective effects of coffee and diabetes"	"2012"	"2016"	"There is significant epidemiological evidence to suggest that moderate coffee consumption is protective against the onset of Type II diabetes. However, intervention studies into the acute effects of coffee on glycaemic control are inconclusive. The aim of this study is to unambiguously establish evidence for the beneficial effects of moderate coffee consumption on postprandial glucose response. It will attempt to clarify whether the effect is attenuated by caffeine, and also shed light on the identity of the active component(s) in coffee. Ultimately, this could result in the identification of food-sourced ingredients which help to regulate blood glucose.

"128875"	"Ingredient functionality"	"2013"	"2015"	"Ingredient specifications for traditional bread products are well documented and understood. However, more than one third of all flour produced in the UK is used for non-bread applications. These include an increasingly wide range of products, including crackers, wafers, doughnuts, and batter coatings, for which the ingredient specifications are not fully understood. In addition, a wider range of bread-based products such as flat breads and tortillas are increasing in popularity. Methods for modifying raw ingredients to improve performance in processing and end product quality are of wide interest. Indeed, many companies have expressed an interest in a deeper understanding of the raw ingredient specifications for their products. An understanding of the functionality required of raw ingredients for various applications, and appropriate methods to test for them, will enable more accurate specification of raw ingredients for specific applications and better management of ingredient variability.

"128876"	"Improved fibre enriched baked goods"	"2013"	"2015"	"Consumption of wholegrain/fibre enriched bread and other baked goods remains low despite considerable evidence linking diets rich in fibre to reduced risks of obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. There is scope for developing new products to appeal to consumer interest in healthy products by using cereals other than wheat and introducing products other than bread. Of particular interest are oats, barley and pseudocereals (such as buckwheat). Soluble fibres (e.g. arabinoxylose, ß-glucan or inulin) provide an alternative to cellulose-rich wheat bran and introduce a different set of challenges for processing. These fibres are light in colour and may be more acceptable to consumers. Considerable academic research has been carried out into the use of pre-treatments to reduce the negative impact of fibre addition on bread quality. The feasibility of applying these techniques in plant bakeries will be evaluated in this work. "	"fred.gates@campdenbri.co.uk"	"Gates, Fred"	"44(0)1386 842093"	"437"	"8826"	"139"	"437"
"132138"	"Starch structure and cell wall digestion"	"2014"	"2018"	"This project will elucidate the fundamental mechanisms by which the benefits of from the consumption of cereal-derived beta-glucan are delivered. In particular, it will focus on the impact of beta-glucan on moderating post-prandial glycaemia and insulinaemia. The working hypothesis is that the mechanism is driven by the reduced rate of absorption resulting from a combination of slowed transit through the gastrointestinal tract (mediated by increased bolus viscosity) and the reduced rate of starch digestion (mediated by inhibition of alpha-amylase activity).

There is no universal measure for stickiness within the food industry and stickiness is usually determined subjectively based on the results of manually handling the dough. The aim of this project is to develop a test to quantitatively measure stickiness and to then investigate the causes of stickiness in bread dough.

"125499"	"Improving process control for reducing energy use in food production"	"2012"	"2014"	"Environmental sustainability has become key for many food manufacturers. The need for energy efficiency is driven by both commercial and regulatory considerations. To remain competitive in the face of rising energy costs, the food industry needs to use energy more efficiently throughout its operations. A paucity of numerical data makes it difficult for organisations to assess the significance of particular operations and practices within their production environment and prioritise them accordingly. There is also a lack of easily accessible support systems, tools and methods to help organisations understand and manage their impacts. This project will develop an easily applicable tool-kit of diagnostic instrumentation to monitor equipment performance, as well as a method for energy optimisation.

The MSD will be based on a versatile plug-in architecture for real-time monitoring (on-/in-line) of multiple parameters associated with the quality and the chemical safety of raw and in-process materials. MSD data array, including quantitative information about both volatile and non-volatile compounds, will be merged by using data fusion techniques and will be used to build empirical predictive models for Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs) and to establish the multivariate design space. Auto-adaptive software will be implemented to automatically adjust Critical Process Parameters (CPPs) on the basis of the real-time measurement of CQAs in the raw and in-process materials. MUSE-tech will contribute to reduce manufacturing costs and food waste by enabling a more efficient control of the processes and supporting the competitiveness of the EU food industry, especially SMEs.

"128881"	"Encouraging positive consumer attitude/behaviour change towards sustainable foods"	"2013"	"2014"	"Previous studies have allowed for the development of an in-depth knowledge and understanding of consumer concerns and barriers when purchasing products with specific ethical and environmental benefits (e.g. health claims, free-range, fair-trade and organic). Cost, awareness and knowledge relating to the social and environmental benefits and perceived benefits of the product appear to influence consumer food choices. The project will build on this knowledge and extend the approaches from studying consumer attitudes to implementing test communication strategies in order to influence consumer behaviour. As end users of the food chain, consumers' positive views and purchasing intentions are essential in encouraging sustainable food production.

"134927"	"An evaluation of traditional and novel sensory and consumer methods suitable for product characterisation"	"2015"	"2017"	"When developing new products, it is traditional to use trained sensory panels to evaluate product characteristics. The information they provide is thorough and is considered to be objective, but the approach is expensive, and ultimately it is the consumer's opinion that matters. Therefore, consumers are also used to screen concepts and assess products for liking and preference, with the datasets being combined in subsequent and detailed analysis. Given the reduced lead times associated with product development, rather than using the sensory and consumer approaches independently, there may be scope to develop an integrated approach that combines the merits of sensory and consumer methods to provide a comprehensive but quick and cost-effective procedure for use in the product development process. This project will evaluate and validate the many new consumer and sensory methods available and give information on which ones can be used or adapted and integrated for product development work. It will also investigate different statistical methods for evaluating the data produced by the methods.

"134929"	"Packaging design - a strategic approach to enhance consumers' sensory perceptions and overall enjoyment of healthy food and drinks"	"2015"	"2017"	"There is a growing demand from both government and consumers for food and drink products that support a healthy lifestyle. Trends for 'healthier' products are focusing on reformulation initiatives (e.g. low or reduced fat, salt, and sugar), promoting 'naturally healthy' products, and health and nutrition claims. This project will assist the healthy food and drink product development process, but from a different perspective. It will focus on packaging designs and will investigate how packaging design can be effectively utilised to communicate product health benefits and enhance consumers' healthy food experience and enjoyment. Our previous research revealed associations between packaging design elements (e.g. colour, graphics, shape) and expected product sensory characteristics (taste, flavour), and demonstrated the impact of packaging designs on consumers' liking and perceptions of product attributes. In this project, we will explore consumers' associations between a number of design elements, e.g. colour, shape, images, and their perceived 'healthiness'. Outcomes from this research will provide general guidance on various packaging design elements and the likelihood of consumers perceiving them as being healthy.

The optimum will be based on the effectiveness of the gas mixes for reducing the numbers of Campylobacter , and the effects on aerobic plate counts, numbers of Pseudomonas , and the drip, colour, rancidity and odour. The gas mixes will include combinations of one or more of the gases O 2 , CO 2 , and N 2 . To achieve this goal, the project has four main parts: (a) assess the effects of gas mixes that are currently used commercially, (b) identify improved gas mixes that lead to a more rapid reduction in Campylobacter and also measure the effects on the other factors, (c) full scale commercial trial of the improved mix including the chain from slaughterhouse to retail, and (d) measure the effects of overwrapping versus sealed packs on Campylobacter counts, compare aerobic plate counts after 20 or 30°C incubation, and measure in-pack gas:meat ratios and variations in Campylobacter counts around carcass surfaces (top vs bottom).
