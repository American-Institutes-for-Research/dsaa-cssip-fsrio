The resulting lateral flow device will be used for simple, rapid diagnosis of fasciolosis at the pen-side and will provide evidence of the life-stage of F. hepatica, this is of paramount importance as it influences the choice and efficacy of drug treatments. In diagnosing the parasite and the most efficacious treatment option the novel test will provide a clear economic benefit to the livestock producer. The test will also allow compliance with government policy on the best practice for F. hepatica treatment being on an individual animal basis. In doing so overall drug use will be reduced again reducing costs to the farmer and contributing to the reduction of anthelmintic-resistance."

"http://randd.defra.gov.uk//Default.aspx?Menu=Menu&Module=More&Location=None&Completed=2&ProjectID=17666#Description"	"2013"	"2018"	"Escherichia coli are common Gram-negative bacteria that form a normal part of the gut flora of humans and animals. However, among the different pathotypes of E. coli some can cause human disease, with the verocytotoxigenic E. coli (VTEC) serotype O157:H7 being one of the most virulent and widespread causing haemorrhagic colitis and haemolytic uraemic syndrome. In 2009, an outbreak of VTEC O157:H7 led to severe illness in a number of visitors to an open farm in Surrey with several cases of life-threatening haemolytic uraemic syndrome in young children. VTEC O157 can be found in several livestock species without causing clinical symptoms in these animals, and the main reservoir seems to be cattle, in particular youngstock. Campylobacteriosis is the most common cause of acute bacterial enteritis in the UK with the main food borne source being poultry meat. In order to prevent carry-over of pathogens from one group of animals to the next and from animals to people, disinfectants are applied to surfaces in animal accommodation. A wide range of products belonging to several groups of chemicals are licensed and used for this purpose, but not all disinfectants are equally effective. While the presence of organic matter does affect the efficacy of all disinfectants to some degree, some are more effective than others in the presence of organic matter due to their chemical properties. In addition to disinfection of surfaces, boot dips are in use on many farms to prevent carry-over of pathogens between different groups of animals. However, disinfectants in boot dips need to be particularly effective in the presence of faecal matter, and previous studies have found that boot dips as currently used in many livestock enterprises are often not efficient barriers to infection and may therefore represent a waste of resources leading to a false sense of security. On many farms, hand sanitizers are used where hand washing facilities are not feasible to reduce the bacterial count on hands and gloves. The use of hand sanitizers has been recommended as a key element of biosecurity, but little hard data exists on efficacy against VTEC O157 or Campylobacter. The proposed work will provide robust data on the best performing disinfectants to be used against VTEC O157 and Campylobacter on livestock premises and will give guidance on which products are most suitable for the different types of applications. These results will be of high practical value and will be used in the future to better inform farmers about the most suitable products they should use to control those bacteria. Several studies suggest that exposure of VTEC O157:H7 to biocides may to lead to an adaptive response which is also likely to lead to cross-resistance to other antimicrobials and biocides. However, the adaptive response mounted is likely to be dependent on the biocide used, its concentration, the number of times and duration of each exposure. The aim of the molecular component of this project is to assess these factors critically at the molecular level using global gene expression studies to understand the basis of development of biocide resistance in VTEC O157 strains and determine conditions which are least likely to lead to such resistances in future, so an effective method may be recommended for long term use on farms as a result of this study. In addition to the expected scientific results, the proposed work on VTEC O157 will help maintain expertise on working with this pathogen in category 3 facilities at AHVLA Weybridge and also allow for training of two members of staff to work on VTEC O157 to allow continuity of this work at the Weybridge site following the upcoming retirement of currently trained staff. The proposed Campylobacter work will contribute to the maintenance of expertise on Campylobacter at the AHVLA and the development of laboratory methods. The results from the project will be summarised in scientific publications but can also be produced as an information leaflet for farmers."

Future regulatory and NCP targets are therefore likely to be very difficult to achieve. There is an urgent need to investigate in detail the effectiveness of control measures in the field, to define the best and most cost-effective methods, their benefit in terms of reduction of public health risk and other pathogens of economic importance in pig production and to effectively transmit the resulting information and guidance to pig producers in a highly motivational way. It is necessary to focus on farm reduction as well as measures in the abattoir as the latter can be undermined by high levels of infection in slaughter pigs and highly infected farms form a reservoir of Salmonella that can spread to other livestock sectors, feed production and contaminate the rural environment. Objective one focuses on a detailed investigation of the protective factors that operated on low (<10% incidence) Salmonella seroprevalence pig farms, the so called ‘Platinum Pig farms’. Previous limited work and a small number of detailed AHVLA investigations of zero-seroprevalence farms have suggested that management of the time of exposure to infection to enhance ‘herd-immunity’ in finishing pigs is critical. We will carry out intensive veterinary microbiological investigations linked with a case control study to further elucidate protective factors on low prevalence farms. Objective two recognises international scientific evidence that there is no single control measure, or simple combination of control measures that can be successfully and economically applied to all pig farms and so a targeted farm-specific control plan is needed. Accredited pig farms are required to have a Salmonella control action plan in place but this can be a general tick-box exercise and is not based on bacteriological evidence, or monitored for effectiveness. Specific interventions such as feed or water acidification, vaccination, improved cleaning and disinfection of finishing pens, improved pest control, all-in/all out production, changes in feed formulation etc. can be included in such control plans and are being trialled by BPEX, pig veterinarians and pig farming companies in various uncontrolled and statistically non-valid ways. We will aim to link with such initiatives to provide statistical input and detailed investigation of the effects of such farm control plans on Salmonella and other production-limiting conditions. We will apply cost analyses and QMRA studies to these, evaluate compliance and refine applications to demonstrate the effectiveness of properly targeted approaches. Objective three will involve further refinement of the BPEX/FSA farm auditing tool to target it more effectively to evaluate measures associated with improved Salmonella control. Objective four will supply detailed data on the most effective detergent/sanitizers and disinfectants to use for porcine Salmonella. Objective five will investigate associations between social network characteristics and prevalence of Salmonella and other disease surveillance conditions. The objective will also compare bacteriological sampling from the study visits against serological surveillance sampling, and evaluate associations between bacteriological Salmonella prevalence and performance indicators.

Maintaining a representative collection of well characterised field and reference Salmonella enterica isolates fulfils the need to conserve reference strains for quality control, development of new typing schemes and source that provides a historic context for prospective studies aimed at understanding this important zoonotic pathogen. Furthermore, the application of new low-cost high-throughput technological approaches to study archived strain collections provides the opportunity to retrospectively analyse old collections providing fresh insights into the epidemiology, transmission and disease patterns. A case in point is the opportunity provided by the emergence of next-generation sequencing technology that has in the last few years made whole genome sequencing (WGS) of thousands of bacterial isolates financially viable. In collaboration between the APHA, the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (WTSI) and PHE, we propose to take a methodical approach to evaluate the potential for retrospective analysis of the APHA Salmonella strain collection. The isolates span over 20 years and the majority are of serotypes that have zoonotic potential. Thus investigating this collection in detail will provide data and context relevant not only to animal health, but also human health. The massive strain collection and related epidemiological and spatio-temporal data will be scrutinised using statistical, Bayesian and phylogenetic methods which will then be used to inform selection of strains for comparative WGS to investigate the genetic properties of key Salmonella strains that are associated with their emergence and decline within certain livestock sectors and environmental niches. DNA based methods have been recommended to replace serotyping for strain discrimination. Sequencing a comprehensive background collection of Salmonella isolates of different serovars will facilitate the development of MLST typing scheme for routine use at APHA, which supplemented by even more discriminatory sequence-based typing methods based on entire genomes will increase strain discrimination and provide a clearer picture of long-term transmission. The proposed study will provide: (1) Context for future control programmes and potentially identify genetic markers for low- cost surveillance tests to identify potentially significant new strains at an early stage. (2) This work will generate algorithms, validated by the sequence data that can be used to select representative strains, allowing a rationalisation of current strain storage and consequent cost savings for selection of representative strains from future surveillance. (3) Work on the genetic stability of strains during different storage conditions will lead to optimisation of long-term storage and maintenance of strains in a manner that minimises losses in viability and genetic change making them more valuable to Government and commercial interests for future work. (4) The findings will also feed into Defra components of future EFSA/ECDC initiatives on molecular typing of zoonotic pathogens, particularly in replacement of the reference laboratory serotyping of Salmonella spp. with WGS based typing by defining MLST derived clonal complexes and replacement of the current reference laboratory methods such as phage typing and MLVA/PFGE with SNP based phylogenies for strain resolution."

This has been in place since 1985 and is of great economic value to the nation. To maintain freedom of disease the nation must rapidly identify and then resolve outbreaks of disease. This may occur via re-importation of infected animals or even re-emergence from an environmental source. The aim of this project is to improve the tools available to detect, trace and eradicate any reintroduction of disease as well as to better facilitate the efficient maintenance of disease free status. This project aims to improve the specificity of immunological assays for the indirect detection of brucellosis in livestock. The currently available tests are vulnerable to cross reactions due to infection with some non-Brucella organisms. The aim is to improve specificity through the design, synthesis and application of cutting edge oligosaccharide antigens which contain only the unique structural elements of the dominant Brucella antigen. The native antigen contains these epitopes within polymers which also contain common epitopes. The project also supports the production, purification and investigation of other abundant surface antigens, such as the rough lipopolysaccharide, that we will derive from Brucella culture. Direct detection methods have potentially greater specificity than immunological tests. The challenge is that Brucella occurs at very low levels in accessible clinical material such as milk and blood. Therefore a means to improve the direct detection of Brucella DNA will be developed and evaluated. This method will combine two powerful techniques, immuno-capture and Real Time PCR, to increase the concentration of target DNA in biological samples in a manner compatible with specific application by PCR. Anti-Brucella antibodies will be coupled to small magnetic beads which will be dispersed and incubated within biological samples. Any Brucella cells present in the samples will specifically bind to the antibodies on the beads. These beads can be concentrated and washed with the aid of magnets such that any captured Brucella cells remain surface bound. The cells, and their DNA, can then be delivered to the PCR reaction. The third challenge to be addressed is to improve the means by which outbreaks of disease can be traced back to source. Traditional classification methods have very low ability to differentiate strains from the same Brucella species and biovar. DNA based molecular methods have greatly improved resolving and identification capability. However, the DNA of different strains of Brucella frequently have such similar DNA sequences that even these methods lack power. This project will combine whole genome sequencing and bioinformatics tools to maximise the ability to differentiate between strains of Brucella. Working with samples from the APHA archive and sourced from international partners we shall construct a database of whole genome sequences such that the ability to identify the source of any disease outbreaks is improved."

Rabies is one of many exotic wildlife diseases which threaten the UK. The OIE lists rabies, Echinococcus multilocularis and Trichinella infection as notifiable, amongst others. The current wildlife rabies contingency plan is very well developed, and has been repeatedly tested in numerous training exercises. This plan involves both the logistical aspects of eradication in wildlife and the predictive simulation modelling to enable a geographically specific contingency plan to be developed. The team responsible for putting the plan into action will be working on this research project to ensure the wildlife diseases contingency plan is refined, improved and broadened to include as many exotic diseases as possible. We propose that this work will progress in these two related areas to permit our current rabies response to be adapted for a more generic wildlife disease situation, as well as ensuring that the rabies contingency plan stays up to date. This will significantly increase our ability to respond to and control any wildlife disease incursion, and the ability to respond timely and proportionately will minimise any upstream costs to government and the taxpayer of new diseases becoming endemic. Additionally, this ability to minimise the time to disease eradication will reduce the time that businesses remain under official restrictions. The establishment and spread of the OIE listed diseases above will probably be heavily dependent on the urban fox density, since this is the greatest opportunity for introduction of infection, allied with the highest available densities. We propose to update urban fox density data by collaborating with ongoing studies. We also propose to refine all mammalian density estimates based on available systematic data collection to ensure that the underlying data for wildlife diseases are available. Computer modelling for exotic disease management is a growing area, and we plan to investigate the potential for eradication of exotic disease other than rabies."	"1.

It is an important pre-requisite for preparedness and rapid response. These risk assessments are typically complex and data-hungry, limiting the real-world applicability in the event of a novel disease outbreak. However, the European Union (EU) maintains a number of extensive and real time datasets. Further data on global presence of disease is available through datasets held by the OIE, WAHID. The objective of the project is to develop an overarching model to make rapid use of available metadata to identify pathways of potential risk for classes of disease transmission (e.g. vector borne). This framework will provide invaluable information for risk assessors in the first instances of a disease outbreak where typically information on imports and routes of entry and potential for spread is undertaken on a case-by-case basis. It will also allow for an objective and systematic evaluation to inform risk-based animal health and zoonotic surveillance activities, either generically or for specific diseases. The framework will be readily adaptable not only to specific disease hazards, but also to broad classes of disease, defined by their mode of transmission. To assure feasibility and focus, the project will group biological hazards into distinct mode-of-transmission classes and develop a case study for each. For the release assessment, relevant incidence data from exporting countries will be combined with trade data, air passenger information, road transport data, and vector movement to identify important trade/movement routes from relevant geographical regions. The exposure assessment will identify the potential spread of disease via competent vectors by member state and for exposure of domestic livestock and/or humans by population density mapping and be used to inform efficient surveillance designs. Encompassing all areas in the project will be a communication network, ensuring that the modelling work builds from previous work in this area and is fit to provide scientific support to decision makers. In the event of an incursion, risk management decisions are to be taken under significant time constraints. The project will specifically address this dialogue and propose processes taking into account existing organisations and structures, to assure a rapid translation from science into policy."

FMD remains endemic in many countries in Africa and Asia. In addition, sporadic outbreaks of disease frequently occur in countries that are normally free from disease such as those recently in Japan, South Korea, Russia, and extensively in PR China. These outbreaks reinforce the concerns about how readily the disease can pass across international borders. FMD is difficult and expensive to control since the causative virus (FMDV) is highly contagious and spreads rapidly through susceptible animals. In the event of an introduction into the UK, successful control and eradication of FMD is dependent upon early recognition of infected animals to reduce the potential for onward transmission of the virus to cause subsequent outbreaks. Accurate tests that can detect FMDV, or FMDV-specific antibody in clinical material play central roles in these activities. The aim of this project is to maintain and improve laboratory-based diagnostic methods for FMD, as well as to continue to evaluate technologies that allow rapid testing to be achieved in the field or in regional laboratories. The focus of this new project will be to develop enhanced virological and serological tests for the diagnosis of FMD, to ensure that the routine diagnostic systems used within the FMD National Reference Laboratory are able to respond rapidly to the threats of FMD incursion into the UK. This proposal covers specific areas that represent key Defra priorities: (i) Molecular and serological tools for earlier detection of FMDV infected livestock (ii) Improved high through-put approaches to monitor and control FMD incursions (iii) Tests that can be used for rapid identification of infected animals as the basis for more targeted control, with a consequent reduction in the costs of FMD outbreaks (industry and government), and (iv) To provide an evidence base to support a future reduction in the length of time businesses remained under official restrictions Research themes will center on the development, evaluation and validation of assays that can detect the presence of FMDV (and can differentiate from other viruses causing vesicular diseases), or serological tests that can be used to identify animals that have been previously exposed to FMD, particularly those within a vaccinated population according to the EU Directive and Recommendations of OIE. In addition, improved methods will be developed to detect “carrier” animals that are associated with persistent replication of virus. Together, the outputs from this project will provide Defra with increased confidence in using such assays for diagnosis and surveillance in the event of future outbreaks of FMD, and provide tools that can be used in post-outbreak surveillance to regain FMD-free status in the UK."	"Objectives: 1. Virological tests, to detect FMDV in clinical or preclinical specimens collected from animals, including: a.

There is also a specific requirement for small ruminant positive samples to be further tested to determine if the strain of TSE present is bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) rather than scrapie, given that this strain is the only one currently known to be zoonotic. The age groups and total numbers of animals tested are modified based on the disease trends identified by this surveillance process, with the aim of reducing the overall cost of testing as outlined in the TSE roadmap 2, published by the European Commission and endorsed in general by Defra. However, within the last decade, as the numbers of BSE and scrapie cases have dropped dramatically, this active surveillance has identified atypical variants in both sheep (Nor98/atypical scrapie) and cattle (L-type BSE/bovine amyloidotic spongiform encephalopathy), and H-type BSE). While it has been proposed that these rare forms of disease are spontaneous, it has also been shown that transmission can be achieved experimentally into a range of host species (cattle, sheep, transgenic mice, primates) and there is evidence that the disease characteristics do not remain stable in some cases. Given that there is still no robust understanding of what makes a particular TSE isolate zoonotic, it is important that we have as broad an understanding and awareness of how such isolates present in food animal species, and how stable they are on inter- and intra-species transmission. They need to be characterised as fully as possible to assist with accurate detection and classification of these cases should they occur in field situations, and to underpin informed assessment of risk to both human and animal health. This is in keeping with one of Defra’s stated aims (in “Livestock - TSE and animal by products evidence plan 2011/12” ) that one of the highest research priorities is to ensure preparedness to detect and evaluate new or unusual TSEs. Emerging data from an existing Defra project investigating the disease produced by experimental infection of sheep with atypical BSE sources (SE1860) suggests that the clinical disease which results would not be considered as suspect TSE by current criteria, and although a positive diagnosis would be obtained through active surveillance, classification of the strain would be problematic using existing methods. However, experimental challenge of cattle (EU funded) resulted in retention of all diagnostic characteristics of the infecting strain. We propose to use material from these sheep and cattle studies to look at whether our existing bioassay techniques can still classify the agent strain, and whether the strains retain or lose specific identifying characteristics when they are passaged through cattle and sheep more than once. This will complement the data on the intra- and inter-species challenges being undertaken with atypical scrapie (SE1847 and separate study submitted for funding by Defra)"	"1.

These requirements are subject to modifications given the decline of BSE cases within Europe and the high costs of testing cattle, which was outlined in the Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy (TSE) Roadmap 2, published by the European Commission and endorsed in general by Defra. However, it was emphasised that the ability to detect new forms of TSEs in cattle must be maintained, which requires investigation of the full spectrum of TSEs that may occur in cattle. Studies in cattle experimentally infected with naturally occurring TSE agents have been used to determine the disease forms and to investigate whether the current tests were able to diagnose and distinguish them from classical BSE, the disease responsible for the UK epidemic. These disease forms were diagnosed successfully by these tests. Another naturally occurring TSE has been recently found in UK sheep and named “atypical scrapie” to distinguish it from the classical form known in the UK for centuries. Atypical scrapie has been found retrospectively in sheep killed around the same time as the first cases of BSE were reported in the UK and is likely to have occurred even earlier. It is not known whether atypical scrapie can transmit to cattle, how the disease looks like and whether it can be diagnosed by the tests applied to brain samples. As body parts of sheep scrapie cases almost definitely have been processed to meat and bone meal (MBM), which is believed to be the source of the BSE epidemic in the UK by feeding it to cattle, cattle are likely to have ingested MBM contaminated with the atypical scrapie agent. The proposed study aims to determine whether atypical scrapie from sheep can transmit to cattle and to characterise the resulting disease. This will be achieved by inoculating five cattle with a brain from a clinically affected atypical scrapie sheep by the intracerebral route, which is known to be the most effective route to produce disease. Five control cattle will be similarly inoculated with saline solution. Cattle will be culled upon development of clinical disease, which together with the findings from the diagnostic tests, will enable us to describe the disease in full detail and compare it with BSE.

Data generated concerning the origins, movement, genetic composition and evolution of economically important orbiviruses that threaten Europe and the UK, provides a basis for development of novel diagnostic assays and risk assessment. Relevant data and analyses will be provided to Defra, the EU, OIE and other national authorities to inform policy decisions concerning appropriate surveillance and control strategies. The global ‘Orbivirus Reference Collection’ (ORC) and sequence-databases (http://www.reoviridae.org/dsRNA_virus_proteins/ReoID/orbiviruses.htm) will be maintained. These important national and international resources, provide data and materials for molecular epidemiology studies and the design / validation of diagnostic assays and vaccines. The European BTV Reference Laboratory, Headed by Dr Carrie Batten has helped detect, type and trace the origins of European BTV outbreak-strains from each year since 1998, including BTV-8 which spread to the UK during 2007. A novel 26th serotype of BTV was identified in Kuwait during 2010, which does not infect adult Culicoides or a Culicoides cell line (KC cells) but can be transmitted horizontally between goats. The recent re-emergence of BTV-8 in central France (in 2015) and continuing transmission of BTV-4 in South Eastern Europe highlight threats posed by BT incursions into central and northern Europe (including the UK). The transmission of both AHSV and EHDV by the same insect-vectors (Culicoides spp.) suggests that they could also spread to/in Europe. Phylogenetic studies of European BTV isolates recently demonstrated the significance of genome-segment exchange (reassortment) in the evolution and emergence of these viruses. The project will isolate and characterise orbivirus strains from outbreaks in Europe and other geographic regions of the world, maintaining the ORC and sequence-database. Full-genome sequences for novel viruses will provide information concerning their origins, movements and evolution. Reassortant genotypes will be identified and characterised, to help assess the risks they represent to Europe and the UK. Specific reassortant strains (e.g. between BTV-1 and BTV-26) will also be generated by reverse-genetics to assess the role of individual genome-segments and viral-proteins (genetic-markers) in control/restriction of infection and replication in Culicoides cells. These data and reassortant-strains will be made available to other projects to determine the significance of individual genome-segments / proteins in transmission by adult Culicoides, or horizontal spread between ruminants. The major outcome of this programme will be provision of data and reference materials to maintain, improve, and validate molecular assays (maintaining diagnostic capability), and for selection, development and testing of novel vaccines by commercial partners. Multiplex typing assays will be developed to increase the speed and reduce costs of surveillance; also reducing the risk that mixed BTV infections will go undetected. Outer-capsid protein VP2 from different BTV serotypes will be expressed in plants and evaluated in serotype-specific ELISA that could potentially replace neutralisation tests to identifying BTV serotype, or BTV serotype-specific antibodies."

As far as is possible within the design of the badger control policy, the purpose is to: a) monitor the effect of the intervention on bovine tuberculosis and b) identify important changes that could affect the badger control policy as early as possible. Given the pre-determined design of the control policy, this project will act as a surveillance activity rather than being hypothesis-driven research. In the first year, badger control licenses will be granted by Natural England (NE) to two pilot areas, with up to ten further areas licensed in each of the following three years. As each new area is selected, NE will share boundary location data, enabling us to identify herds located in each intervention area and its 2km ‘buffer’ region. We will first establish historical (three-years preceding intervention) bTB frequency measures in herds located within intervention areas so that changes over time can be assessed. Several bTB frequency measures will be analysed: e.g. number of new herd breakdowns per 100 herds tested, proportion of herds under movement restrictions due to a bTB breakdown etc. Secondly, as bTB incidence may change over time for reasons unrelated to intervention, areas without intervention will be selected as comparison areas. Comparison areas most similar to intervention areas in features such as historical bTB incidence, cattle demography and geographical location will be selected. This is to reduce the risk that differences in incidence between intervention and comparison areas are due to factors other than badger control. However, it will not be possible to completely remove this risk or that of random variation and therefore cautious interpretation of study results will be required. Once comparison areas have been selected, reports will be compiled for each intervention: comparison couplet describing their historical bTB incidence and other features (e.g. cattle herd demography) that may influence the interpretation of future results. Six-monthly and annual monitoring reports will examine different measures of bTB in cattle herds through simple descriptive statistics and graphs and more in-depth analyses where the effects of some factors (other than badger control) that could cause a difference between intervention and comparison areas, are adjusted for using regression techniques. Any observable change in incidence resulting from the badger cull is likely to occur slowly over time and effects may not be observed in the early years of the study. However the effect of culling is anticipated to increase over time therefore the surveillance methods developed herein should be used for longer term monitoring."

"SE3247"	"Development of an oral BCG vaccine for badgers - regulatory component"	"http://randd.defra.gov.uk//Default.aspx?Menu=Menu&Module=More&Location=None&Completed=2&ProjectID=16213#Description"	"2010"	"2016"	"There was an estimated 225% increase in the number of bovine tuberculosis (TB) incidents in Great Britain between the years 1996 and 2006. This adversely affects animal health and welfare, and is a cause of considerable economic loss to farmers and Government. Although transmission of Mycobacterium bovis between cattle is an important factor in spread of the disease, the Eurasian badger (Meles meles) represents an additional wildlife source of recurrent M. bovis infection to cattle in both the UK and Ireland. Following the recent Ministerial statement that badgers would not be culled as part of control measures for bovine TB (http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/ministers/statements/hb080707.htm), the vaccination of badgers against TB has come to the fore as a possible means to reduce and control bovine TB alongside other control measures. It has long been recognised that delivery of vaccine in oral bait holds the best prospect for vaccinating badgers over a wide geographical area and has proved highly successful for mass vaccination of other wildlife species against rabies. In the short to medium term, M. bovis Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine represents the best available option for vaccination of badgers against TB. Options for the formulation of BCG in bait will be explored under a complementary research project. This project will focus on experimental work using the oral vaccine in order to generate data for the licensing of the vaccine. There are defined steps to achieve this as follows, and each of these requirements form part of this project: • Experimental safety study on captive badgers performed to Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) accreditation. • A field safety study on wild badgers performed to Good Clinical Practice (GCP). • Demonstration of the effectiveness of the vaccine to badgers in experimental infection studies. Another important element to this project and related to the safety of the vaccine, is assessment of the likelihood and consequences of exposure of non-target species to the oral bait vaccine. EU Directive 92/18/EEC requires that the potential risk to unvaccinated animals of the target or any other potentially exposed species shall be evaluated. The Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) will be responsible for evaluating the application to obtain a National Marketing Authorisation for the oral badger vaccine. The most significant non-target species from the perspective of TB control is cattle. There is a need to quantify and determine the risks associated with exposure of cattle to the badger bait vaccine in advance of decisions over whether to vaccinate badgers orally as part of TB control policy, and make recommendations about precautions that can be taken to reduce the risk. The first element of this process will be addressed in the complementary research project, where the palatability of various candidate baits to cattle is being evaluated in a natural grazing situation using camera surveillance. In this project, we will evaluate uptake in the higher risk situation where baits are deployed at setts to which cattle have access, and then move towards an evaluation of the means of reducing this exposure risk."

This is the case for bovine tuberculosis (bTB), a disease primarily of cattle but also found in a number of wildife species; in Britain and Ireland the most important of these is the Eurasian badger (Meles meles). While Ireland has had a persistent bTB problem in cattle, by the 1970's bTB had been almost eradicated from GB but since then there has been a dramatically re-emerging disease in cattle. Bovine TB is a zoonosis with implications for both humans and animal health, though chronic cases of either in Britain and Ireland are few. Control of bTB also places a severe strain on individual farmers, the farming industry and government, with a projected cost in England & Wales alone of over £1bn over the next decade. While it has long been suspected that badgers are involved, research efforts to date have not determied the extent to which badgers are responsible for bTB in cattle. One of the most important developments in epidemiology of the last few decades has been the increased use of 'genetic fingerprinting' to identify patterns of disease spread. Until recently, this has largely been done using only a small number of selected regions in the genome. While this kind of ""genetic fingerprinting"" has been useful and shows that cattle and badgers in the same region are usually infected by the same bTB strain, the fingerprints are far from unique: many cattle and many badgers share the same type, making it impossible to determine who infected whom. In this project we will take advantage of novel technology making it feasible and affordable to sequence the entire M. bovis genome for large numbers of samples Because the bacterium occasionally makes mistakes while replicating its genome, new mutations constantly arise which are not seen using traditional fingerprinting methods but with the new technolgoy creating a much more unique and discriminatory genetic fingerprint of transmission. Using samples collected over decades from cattle and badgers in GB and NI we will sequence the genomes of hundreds of isolates to genetically track the spread of the pathogen and to test whether it is predominantly maintained in cattle, in badgers or both. The unique opportunity exploited in this proposal is the availability of extraordinarily dense sampling of cattle and badger infection together with entire life histories of individual cattle, inlciuding movement to other farms and whether it became infected with bTB at some point in its life. This creates an exceptional resource, allowing us to compare our very detailed understanding of contacts between cattle and between herds with the genetic fingerprint information. Based on this information we will use mathematical models linked directly to statistical inference methods to simulate how the infection may have spread through cattle populations in Britain and Ireland and how it may have genetically changed in the process. This will be done under various different assumptions about the multiple possible sources and mechanisms of infection. By comparing our simulated results to the actual observations (e.g. the number of infected cattle and the type of bTB they carry, etc.), we will gain unprecedented insight into the drivers for the spread of the disease and what may prevent it's current control."

Some of these arboviruses, such as bluetongue virus (BTV) are spread by biting midges, have a proven track record of incursion and economic impact in the UK. Others, such as Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) are spread by mosquitoes and have not entered the UK, but could have significant economic consequences for agriculture and trade if they did so. Early detection and implementation of control methods are critical in eliminating such a disease outbreak as part of Defra strategy for dealing with exotic and notifiable diseases (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/great-britain-and-northern-ireland-continency-plan-for-exotic-notifiable-diseases-of-animals). In order to meet the threat of emerging arboviruses through provision of diagnostic assays and datasets to support policy decision making, Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) and The Pirbright Insititute (TPI) are coordinating research activities in this subject area. This project aims to integrate the work of both Institutes to improve prediction, detection and control of arbovirus incursions in the UK. We have selected three key areas in which a lack of scientific evidence would currently limit decision making or which provide key capacity retention in skills relevent to this area. Firstly, we will improve front line diagnostic assays for RVFV and conduct field studies of potential UK vector mosquitoes that will inform risk assessments of incursion and spread. RVFV is an economically important zoonotic arbovirus that has been identified as a potential threat to the UK and robust detection methods are required in the event of incursion into Europe. Secondly, we will carry out field studies of Culicoides biting midges to define behaviour during the summer and winter periods and to accurately quantify the number of generations completed by species during the summer for the first time. These parameters are key components in models defining the extent and speed of spread and are broadly applicable to all Culicoides-borne viruses (e.g. BTV; African horse sickness virus; Epizootic Haemorhagic disease virus). Thirdly, in order to model arbovirus transmission we will use a specifically chosen virus (bovine ephemeral fever virus: BEFV) to carry out a joint exercise in determining vectors through artificial feeding experiments and an animal experiment. We have chosen BEFV because its primary vectors remain uncertain (having been narrowed to either biting midges or mosquitoes), it is known to be present on the fringes of Europe and no current vaccine is available. The primary aim of the objective is for APHA and TPI to combine expertise and resources to define the process of arbovirus transmission under UK conditions and in doing so to enhance the skill sets available to both parties and hence UK capability."

Bats have very broad geographic ranges and variable contacts with domestic animals and humans. The identified reservoir bat species of henipaviruses are known to feed on commercial food crops, as well as the bats themselves being a food source for humans. An outbreak of Nipah virus in Malaysia in 1998 resulted in the culling of over one million pigs and the deaths of over 100 people. This virus has since caused multiple outbreaks with human-to-human transmission in Bangladesh and India. In 2011 there were more Hendra virus cases in horses in Australia than all the previous years combined. A five year research project, ANTIGONE (ANTIcipating the Global Onset of Novel Epidemics) has been part-funded by the European Commission. The project started in November 2011 and is due to finish in November 2016. As part of this project the AHVLA will be developing a risk assessment model for the introduction of bat-borne zoonotic viruses into the European Union (EU). We will develop a generic risk assessment framework that will consider the possible routes of introduction of bat-borne zoonotic viruses with pandemic potential into the EU. Viruses to be considered will include: Nipah virus, Ebola and Marburg viruses (which have shown their pandemic potential in multiple spillovers from animal to human populations, with subsequent spread and high mortality in people) and SARS-like coronaviruses (in 2003 SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) was a dramatic example of how quickly a zoonotic virus can spread around the world). Routes considered will include; human travel, fruit imports, pig imports and illegal bushmeat trade. This work will build upon previous Defra funded and published work at the AHVLA on developing a UK henipavirus risk assessment. This generic framework will be used as the basis for a more in-depth assessment of specific case studies (i.e. to assess the risk of a specific virus being introduced into an individual MS or region). These case studies will, where appropriate, use quantitative modelling techniques to incorporate variability and/or uncertainty about variables such as the volume of trade of a particular item (e.g. bushmeat) and the amount of virus excreted by infected animals. In addition, a spatial risk assessment, based on susceptible population densities, will be linked to the case study assessments, to inform risk-based surveillance and identify disease emergence “hot spots”. It is intended that some of the other workpackages within ANTIGONE will generate relevant data to inform the case studies, such as quantification of the survival of Nipah virus in food products and provision of data on presence and prevalence of Nipah virus and other bat-borne zoonoses in European bats. We anticipate that these methods could be applied to other exotic diseases in the future and may complement current disease prioritisation tools to provide a more in-depth assessment where data (and time) are available and contribute to the development of more effective and timely prevention and control measures."
