While ensuring regular and standardised food supplies, these processes have also resulted in over-production, collapsing farmgate returns and rising public fears about food safety. Thus interest is growing in the potential for developing 'alternative' or 'relocalised' food systems based on quality, traceability and shorter supply chains. This research aims: to Conceptualise food relocalisation; Compare the extent of food relocalisation in the West Midlands and South-West regions of England; Analyse institutional strategies for promoting food relocalisation; Examine producer attempts to develop local food networks; Explore consumer perceptions of local food products; and Examine the policy implications of food relocalisation. Qualitative and quantitative methods will be used to unravel the complex networks operating between producers, consumers and institutions. The main outputs of the research will be An informed conceptualisation of food relocalisation; An explanation of current food relocalisation processes in the two regions; and A set of policy recommendations for the future development of sustainable local food supply systems.

Extreme events such as droughts cause significant economic losses, and threaten human health and food security. Drought impacts may be significant in regions where food distribution is largely dependent on river-transport. The main objective of this project is to develop a computer-based tool for predicting where and when food security of Amazonian city-dwellers will be threatened by droughts, because of impaired river transport and higher food prices. In addition to collecting food-price data, household food insecurity will be assessed using questions from the Brazilian Food Insecurity Scale. This data will be combined with freely-available information on river levels and poverty distribution across the whole Amazon to produce predictive models. The outcome will be a tool that can generate maps to show the level of Food Security Risk for all municipalities in the Amazon, which will facilitate strategic investment of resources to reduce urban food insecurity."

A different packet of crisps, however, will be accepted quite happily; the packet may look different, but most children will try what is inside. The refusal to try new foods on sight is caused by the neophobic response to foods; a refusal to try a food that has not been eaten before. This process is reasonably well understood, although no research has been carried out into when, or how, it first develops. The second process, that of being able to overcome the neophobic response and eat a new food because it looks similar to a known food, is not well understood. Knowledge about this generalization process may however help in the understanding of how young children’s diet may be improved to include more ‘healthy’ foods. This study will look at the development the fear of new foods, and the categorisation of, and generalizations made about, liked foods, in children between the ages of two and four years. Some children will be observed throughout this time, others will help us, at different age points, with various sort, or forced choice, tasks. "	"81"	"Greville-Harris, M"	"-1"

The research addresses this question by comparing two approaches people have been taking to making governments more accountable for food security. Focusing on the ‘food crisis’ since 2007, it will examine right-to-food movements and riots over food prices in Bangladesh, India, Kenya and Mozambique. The research asks: How well do officials and policymakers understand how food price rises affect people? How do people view government responsibilities to protect access to food? Under what conditions do riots and right-to-food campaigns make governments more accountable for hunger? The research will involve interviews with activists, protestors, affected groups (particularly women on low incomes), key officials and policymakers, and secondary analyses of media accounts of protests and activism, and official policy changes and statements. It will improve understanding of how to hold governments to account over hunger, enable policymakers to better anticipate and monitor the effects of food price volatility, and create opportunities for activists to engage with policymakers and government officials."

There is also evidence to suggest that food that is withheld is also subject to enhancement similar to that of a reward food. However, recent pilot studies conflict in their support of this hypothesis. This may be because for some children, no foods are withheld in the home and so the enhancement effect is not open to them. The aim of this research project is to run a series of simple tasks in which the discounting/enhancing of foods which are made more or less available, either by using a story paradigm or by using a real food choice task, will be evaluated. The data from the tasks will be compared with data from parental questionnaires, so that the relationship between parental feeding management style and the childs cognitions about wittheld food can be determined "	"81"	"Greville-Harris, M"	"-1"
"RES-224-25-0041"	"Eating Biodiversity: An Investigation of the Links between Quality Food Production and Biodiversity Protection"	"http://researchcatalogue.esrc.ac.uk//grants/RES-224-25-0041/read"	"2005"	"2007"	"Modern food production systems have long been thought of as essentially detrimental to biodiversity. Although the last twenty or so years have seen an increasing number of policy measures and instruments to reduce biodiversity loss in agricultural areas biodiversity is largely conceived as an 'externality' to the process of food production, albeit a positive externality, which responds to societal demands. Increasingly, where food comes from is becoming important as a means of regaining consumer trust. Food that comes from identifiable natural areas is often perceived to be more trustworthy and of better quality than anonymous industrialised produce. In countries such as France and Italy, the specific natural qualities of individual ‘terroirs’ define not only the agronomic conditions of production but also, and crucially, the distinctive taste and consumption experience associated with the product. By examining selected examples of specific food production chains that fully integrate biodiversity as an explicit means of generating distinctiveness and adding value, this research offers an inter-disciplinary perspective by positioning biodiversity and environmental quality as an integral 'input' to, and component of, food quality. The research is investigating through the combining of social and natural science, the extent to which environmental distinctiveness and quality (specifically the biodiversity of grasslands) in UK food production sites can be actively ‘valorised’ through the food product chain to ensure the protection, maintenance and enhancement of that natural distinctiveness and quality but also to achieve similarly distinctive quality food products and the socio-economic benefits for producers and rural communities that might accrue from their production "	"81"	"Buller, Henry"	"-1"

It investigates questions about how the relationship between production and consumption can be addressed beyond the Modernist dichotomous tradition. Foodstuff (potatoes, carrots, and flour) is traced from the site of production, through the site of food preparation and into the site of the stomach by way of empirical and theoretical conceptualisations of the embodied practices of organic food consumers. An innovative methodological framework is deployed which works with visual methods (video diary material) in conjunction with more traditional methods (in-depth focus groups) to apprehend the cognitive, represented knowledges and corporeal, visceral knowledges of organic food consumers. The lines of an intercorporeal, material ethic are drawn between bodies that eat and bodies that are eaten. The project aims: to challenge existing studies of food, by problematising the category of food as anything other than the meaning-making of a thing performed as edible by the practice of eating; to demonstrate new approaches for studying interior processes of the body using non-scientific methods;  to develop connections between materiality, corporeality and practical ethics; to offer a distinctly geographical contribution to the development of visual methodologies in the social sciences.

"http://researchcatalogue.esrc.ac.uk//grants/RES-000-22-1745/read"	"2006"	"2007"	"Obesity and overweight is an increasing concern for health professionals in the UK. Clearly this trend can be attributed to a range of factors. However, in relation to diet, the underlying problem is not straightforward. We know that weight gain occurs when an individual consumes food in excess of need. But are some people predisposed to engage in this behaviour? And, can this tendency be attributed to a particular kind of responsiveness to food? In the UK people are exposed to the sight and smell of food, often many times a day. This is important, because several studies indicate that people consume more food when a meal is preceded by exposure of this kind. Recent evidence suggests that this phenomenon should not be regarded as a simple laboratory-based curiosity. This is because individuals appear to vary in their sensitivity to this 'food-cue exposure.' And, importantly, this variability appears to be associated with measures of everyday dietary behaviour that predict BMI (Body Mass Index). On this basis, it follows that individuals who are especially sensitivity to the effects of food-cue exposure might also be at risk of overweight and obesity. This research will test this proposition. "	"81"	"Brunstrom, Jeffrey"	"-1"

However, there is very little consensus on what sustainable agriculture entails and how to design just and resilient food systems. Three key bodies of academic literature, however, are converging around the idea that sustainability, justice and resilience are, first, interlinked and, second, that they all emerge from democratic food systems in which producers and consumers can exercise autonomy over the choices they make. Our series of workshops will bring together academics, policymakers and representatives of the private and third sectors, along with input from members of the general public, to advance understanding of what sustainable, resilient and just agri-food systems look like in the UK, Brazil and India, which together represent important exemplars of food-system challenges."

The economic and social costs associated with communicable animal diseases, particularly after recent foot and mouth, avian influenza and bluetongue outbreaks in the UK, have made biosecurity both a key policy goal and a widely used if poorly understood term. The term biosecurity is often used to suggest a sanitised landscape and a clinical approach to food and agriculture, with little patience for the untidiness of food and landscape practices that need to contend with a range of other concerns. The project explores the interfaces between biosecurity and other concerns, including workers’ health and safety, eating cultures and food security, and wildlife conservation practices. This exploration will be undertaken through ethnographic work on farms, in food safety settings and on wildlife reserves, as well as through focus groups with lay publics. The project is supported by partner organisations including the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust and the Food Ethics Council. "	"81"	"Hinchliffe, Steve"	"-1"

"R000223410"	"The Politics of GM Food"	"http://researchcatalogue.esrc.ac.uk//grants/R000223410/read"	"2001"	"2002"	"The issue of genetically modified (GM) food policy is of pivotal importance given that it affects everybody and has, in recent years, featured as a major source of controversy. In just four years a technology which seemed part of progress itself has become intensely controversial. The Government has become noticeably more cautious on the issue, as evidenced by Prime Ministerial statements made at the end of February 2000. The composition of advisory bodies dealing with the subject has been altered to include a wider constellation of approaches and supermarkets have been reducing the availability of GM food on their shelves. Previous ESRC funded research has concentrated on risk management and has criticised the lack of input from environmentalists on governmental advisory bodies. However we need to acknowledge that environmentalists, who have limited resources when compared to the food technology companies, have managed to sway public opinion and change government policy. Previous research has been silent on this issue. There is a battle between two sets of ideas concerning GM food. The food technology companies argue that the technology will produce cheap food; the environmentalists contend that there are major health and environmental risks with the technology. This research will examine both how and why the environmentalists view of GM foods has become more important in influencing Government policy. More specifically, the research will focus on three areas: the role of policy networks; the attitudes of food retailers in this area and the factors which have shaped these attitudes; and the influence of environmental groups on science policy. All these issues will be examined in the context of the relevant theoretical literature. Policy networks According to many students of public policy, policy networks play a crucial role in policy development and implementation. We shall identify the policy network(s) involved in this area and assess its(their) influence over policy making. In addition, we shall examine how the network(s) has(have) changed over time as the importance of environmental groups has grown and how any change in the network(s) has (have) been related to policy change. At the same time we shall consider the role of the EU in relation to both the policy network(s) and policy outcomes. Food retailers and GM foods Here a number of issues are crucial: How is it that leading food retailers have, by engaging in self-regulation on GM foods, taken it upon themselves to intervene in matters which are normally regarded as being political? What are the circumstances surrounding the changes in attitudes of food retailers towards GM food? To what extent have the actions of the food retailers been influenced by the activities of environmental groups? How has the self-interest of the food retailers been re-interpreted in this instance? Science and the environment The GM food controversy has occurred in the wake of so-called food scares such as salmonella in eggs and the BSE problem. To what extent does this trend indicate that we have entered an age in which new technologies pose ever greater risks to our survival? Or is it rather better seen as evidence of how the strength of environmental ideas has increased and how people are now more prone to mistrust, or at least be sceptical of, the judgements made by establishment experts? This project will examine these issues. Methods The research will involve analysis of governmental and Parliamentary papers and reports. However the major source of primary data will be a series of interviews with key actors in the policy making process. We shall interview: 1. Civil servants and political advisers. The interviews will be conducted in the MAFF, the DTI and the Environmental Section of the DETR. We shall also interview Government scientists and members of advisory groups. 2. The food industry and retailers. This includes not only food technology companies but also the food retailers. 3. The environmental movement, including a wide number of differing groups with differing objectives and tactics. 4. The media. It important to analyse the way in which the media has dealt with the issue since it is the appearance on the media agenda of the GM food issue that has given opportunities to environmental groups to establish their case.

This work examines the potential for development of sustainable food chains capable of delivering healthy foods at prices consumers are willing to pay, and assesses the impact on land use and the rural environment and economy. The research studies extensive livestock production systems and their effects on the fat composition of ruminant meat and dairy products. Likewise, it studies fruit and vegetable production systems, transport and storage and their effects on nutrient levels. Consumers are being surveyed to assess their attitudes, behaviour and willingness to pay for healthier and locally produced foods. The information is fed into models of demand, land use and employment and the implications of alternative policy scenarios for landscapes and biodiversity are assessed as well as the value countryside users place on those changes. Subsidiary objectives are: To model the effects on consumer demand, land use, rural employment, landscape and biodiversity of the availability of domestically produced nutritionally improved fruit and vegetables, dairy and meat products. To assess novel production systems for soft fruit and lettuce with respect to beneficial micronutrient and phytochemical levels, examine postharvest degradation, and compare imported and domestic produce; and assess novel extensive ruminant livestock production systems for improved fatty acid composition in meat and milk. To estimate consumers' attitudes, behaviour and willingness to pay for local and nutritionally improved foods and use these to model the options for and implications of nutrition driven food policy for the rural economy, land use and human health. The work is being undertaken at the University of Reading and involves a stakeholder platform comprising consumer groups, rural organisations, agricultural, food retail, food service and food production industries as well as Government scientists.

The recently published Curry report on the future of farming and food claimed that local food chains constituted one of the greatest opportunities for farmers and producers to add value and retain a bigger slice of the retail price. To study these issues the proposed research focuses on three regional case studies - Wales, South West England and Tuscany - each of which is actively engaged in promoting local and organic food chains. The prospects for these novel agri-food chains depend on a combination of local and non-local factors. The main non-local factors include the macro regulatory regime and the policy context, factors we address by examining the mid-term review of the CAP and the transfer of resources to Pillar II, which supports sustainable forms of agriculture and rural development. The main local factors include the level of consumer demand and the quality of the regional support system. The principal methods for achieving these research aims will be threefold: (1) an extensive set of semi-structured interviews with institutions, producers and retailers (2) analysis of official documents and grey literature and (3) an Advisory Panel of regulators, producers and retailers to collect data and expedite the dissemination of results to appropriate user communities "	"81"	"Morgan, Kevin John"	"-1"

In response today's environment has been described as 'obesogenic', or one which encourages excess food consumption and discourages physical activity, through factors that are social, cultural, structural and economic in origin. Plausible environmental influences include design features of the built environment (such as walkability and connectivity), availability and quality of recreational and outside space, transport options (including walking and cycling), access to labour saving devices (such as household appliances and cars), physical aspects of food supply, such as easy access to high fat and energy dense food for consumption in and outside of the home, regulation of food supply systems and cultural changes in the consumption, marketing and advertising of unhealthy foods. This series will stimulate interdisciplinary discussion, debate and research, to address a problem that is becoming increasingly important to the UK's health, society and economy.

Recent studies have shown the role of food in the demonstration of care (eg Kaplan 2000) and the negotiation of power relationships between adults and children (Grieshaber, 1997). It is central to the construction of children’s identities (James et al., 2009) both in families (Wills et al., 2008) as well as amongst peers (Valentine, 2000). This project advances knowledge exchange between academics, practitioners, carers and educators in relation to the use of food in the care of looked after children. It will co-produce, with Partner Agencies and the Institute for Research and Innovation in Social Services, a training package on the symbolic use of food in residential and foster care and design an interactive assessment tool to aid residential staff and foster carers’ reflections on the child in their care and the food practices which are in place.

Psychological research has demonstrated that how people behave is influenced by perceptions of how other people behave in similar situations and by the opinions of others about what is appropriate behaviour in a given context. In relation to eating behaviour, people look to others as a guide for how much to eat and the presence of other people in eating situations can guide food selection. This suggests that one way of encouraging healthier eating is to provide information about the healthy eating habits of others. This approach has been used successfully to reduce unhealthy consumption of alcoholic drinks but has yet to be applied to eating behaviour. To address this, a series of experiments will be conducted in which participants will be exposed to posters and flyers that provide information about the healthy eating behaviour of others. Effects on actual food selection in a simulated café environment will then be assessed. It is predicted that healthier food selection will be promoted.   The results will provide evidence to help develop a new intervention to promote healthier eating."	"81"	"Higgs, Suzanne"	"-1"

Such pricing techniques include offers couched in terms of bargain prices for buying more food.  For example, restaurants offer customers larger food portions for little extra cost, free refills on soft drinks, two meals for the price of one, and all-you-can-eat buffets for a set price. Similarly, supermarkets make extensive use of multiple-unit pricing offers such as ""three for the price of two"" and ""buy one get one free"" (""BOGOF""). The research provides theoretical and empirical analysis on whether and to what extent such offers are beneficial or harmful from an economic and social perspective with the purpose of providing fresh insights for the current policy debate on how best to tackle these two great social problems.   "	"81"	"Dobson, Paul"	"-1"

Humans have evolved an appetite system which defends well against undereating but has only weak defences against overeating. Health professionals and slimming organisations encourage the adoption of a healthy, low-fat diet and an overall reduction in caloric intake. In addition, behavioural techniques are advocated as adjuncts to dietary management, including eating meals slowly, thinking water before and during meals, eating foods of low energy density, eating without distraction, and eating at set times. However, it is unclear what impact, if any, such behavioural strategies have on appetite regulation and if the objective to curtail intake can be achieved. The overall aim of the current proposal is to investigate direct and indirect controls of food intake in a young, normal weight, healthy population, compared to obese dieters. The research programme seeks to investigate volume and orosensory stimulation as direct controls of food intake and to examine distraction and social context as indirect controls of food intake.

We will use a novel alternative approach which segments the population according to the preferences which underlie their choices and therefore according to the likely response to interventions. We will proceed to relate differences between segments to cognitive factors influencing behaviours. We will explore how susceptible consumers within particular clusters are to the range of “biases” influencing food choice (eg, tolerance of risk, conformity to social norms, discount rates, impulsivity etc). We will use a questionnaire-based survey to explore the range of social and cognitive factors that explain the susceptibility to biases influencing food choice.

Intellectual property rights are an important source of market power and market power itself is a prerequisite for the emergence of some business practices. Our work should allow us to address several important issues. First, is the GM revolution likely to increase industry concentration in the provision of food? If so, what are the likely effects on prices, product selection and risk management and what should guide public policy toward such mergers? Second, would an increase in market power, combined with the technical characteristics of some GM crops, promote the use of undesirable business practices? How should such practices be handled by competition policy? Third, are broad patents, including patents on genes, justified or should patents be restricted to applications of genes?

Using data gathered by the grant-holder through fieldwork in the Moluccas over a 30 year period, it will test the hypothesis that sago extraction is an intuitively and technically simple solution to food provision for those reluctant to adopt ‘proper’ agriculture, and investigate how sago palm management is a means of raising productivity.  Although sago has been in decline as a staple, it remains the resource of choice during periods of instability and imported food shortages. The collapse of the Indonesian economy in 1999, communal conflict, and subsequent population displacement on a massive scale, has emphasized yet again the food security role played by sago starch.

Several reports have suggested a link between the impacts of AIDS on children and their prospects of food security in adult life: for instance, children whose parents die of AIDS may fail to inherit land or other productive assets, and transmission of knowledge and skills between the generations may be disrupted, leaving young people ill-prepared to build food-secure livelihoods for themselves. This project will be the first to empirically investigate these propositions. Employing a participatory methodology and adapting DFID’s sustainable livelihoods framework, the research will identify how AIDS-affected young people are incorporated into (or excluded from) current household livelihood strategies, the processes and practices that shape their access to livelihood opportunities, now and in the future, and how they make decisions about livelihoods. The ultimate aim is to develop, with young people, recommendations for enhancing livelihood sustainability, applicable at a range of scales from the local to national policy levels.

These three problems are deeply interconnected in ‘the food-energy-climate change trilemma’. Different regions of the world, through natural endowments, levels of development, and varied economic and political systems, have both driven and responded differently to trilemma challenges. The research methodology will compare four regions: the USA, Europe, Brazil and China. It will employ strategic food+energy crops as research probes into changing economic configurations, undertaking 150 in-depth interviews with stakeholders, policy-makers and experts. The research will explore the critical tension between pathways of transition to escape the horns of the trilemma and entrapments in the fossil carbon economy and high GHG-footprint agriculture. The research aims to explain the different regional political and market responses to trilemma challenges, and how these are intensifying or diminishing risks of economic crisis and damaging climate change. A neo-Polanyian theoretical framework of ‘instituted economic processes’  will be developed to illuminate these critical global developments in a way that is innovative and informative to social and natural scientists, relevant to policy makers, and engages with the wider public."

The impact of policy on diet will depend on how consumers adapt their food purchasing behaviour in response to the policy, on how firms in turn respond in terms of the prices they set and the foods they offer, and on how food purchased is shared between individuals within households. There have been important methodological advances in modelling these behaviours, but their application to policy has relied on several restrictive distributional assumptions, which are known to heavily influence the results. This project aims to develop a better set of tools that allow some of these restrictive assumptions to be relaxed, and that will help improve understanding of how potential policy interventions will affect consumer and firm behaviour, and hence lead to better subsequent impact on nutritional outcomes. In particular, the project will focus on extending models of consumer demand to allow for flexible heterogeneity in preferences, extending existing methods that are used for identifying individual consumption from household level expenditure data, and applying these techniques to the analysis of policy in the area of food and nutrition."

Many standards are ‘voluntary’ and have been developed and overseen by organisations from the private sector, sometimes working with non-governmental organisations (NGOs), to promote food safety and quality, good agricultural practice and labour standards. This project is concerned with private standards initiatives (PSIs) developing and monitoring these standards particularly those in developing countries. Focusing on agri-food chains originating in Kenya, the aim is to explore what these standards and initiatives mean for 'governance' or the exercise of power. It explores what PSIs mean for regulation, how sustainable they are and how accessible and effective they may be for poor farmers and workers. The project will develop a conceptual framework for the analysis of PSIs drawing on value chain analysis and approaches to regulation. The field work will involve in-depth qualitative study of selected Kenyan PSIs and their stakeholders using semi-structured interviews, focus groups and workshops with NGOs, government officials, horticulture firms, workers and smallholder farmers as well as European retailers and standards institutions.

The current 'bushmeat crisis' is threatening both wildlife populations and the people who depend on bushmeat for food or income. It is crucially important that human needs and pressures are understood in order to enable sustainable use of wild resources, and socio-cultural issues need to be better integrated into research, policy and practice by conservationists and economists. This fellowship builds on interdisciplinary PhD research conducted in Equatorial Guinea, which identified growing demand by an increasing urban population and a lack of alternative fresh animal protein sources as contributing to unsustainable levels of bushmeat hunting. In addition to publishing and further disseminating these results, the fellowship will develop proposals for further research into culturally acceptable and economically feasible alternatives to bushmeat, both for urban consumers and rural hunters. Small-scale livestock husbandry and aquaculture projects will be explored as a potential profit centre for rural households and hunters, which would tackle both demand and supply by producing an alternative food and income source to bushmeat.   "	"81"	"Kumpel, Noelle"	"-1"

This theory proposes that episodes of craving (for drugs, alcohol, food, etc.) begin when internal or environmental triggers elicit thoughts about the desired substance that feel spontaneous and intrusive. These thoughts are then elaborated: people imagine indulging their desire. This imagery is momentarily pleasurable but ultimately aversive, highlighting people’s awareness of not having the desired substance. The study tests the hypothesis that intrusive thoughts trigger craving. It compares attempted thought suppression, a common way of trying to cope with craving but one that paradoxically tends to increase craving, with two novel techniques, thought diversion and acceptance. Thought diversion requires participants to imagine an alternative, pleasurable situation, whereas thought acceptance or ‘mindfulness’ trains them to accept the intrusive thoughts and then to ‘let them go’. The prediction is that participants engaging in thought diversion or acceptance will experience fewer intrusive thoughts about snacking, and lower levels of craving, than those instructed to suppress thoughts about food. If this outcome transpires, thought diversion and acceptance could become a part of public education programmes to tackle obesity and use of harmful substances. "	"81"	"Andrade, Jackie"	"-1"

In particular, more rigorous research linking microbiological research to public perceptions of risk; actual levels of risk, and public perceptions of 'traceability' in the food chain and water quality is needed. In this project we bring together expertise to determine current perceptions of farmers, retailers, consumers and local 'downstream' industries to the issue of faecal indicator organism (FIO) transfers to watercourses and assess the impacts of changes in management practices (to reduce the risk of FIO transfers) on farm costs and costs to other stakeholder groups and the region as a whole.

Some of these debates have been heavily researched by academics, some less so, but very few have been directly related to our everyday perceptions and behaviour as consumers. This research considered how products are supported by and marketed through contested scientific claims, thereby using the scientific credibility of products to analyse how the public, as consumers, perceive and value science in  everyday life. Case studies included products that make: a) claims about the point of origin and conditions of production, eg sustainable wood or fish products; b) claims about the point of consumption and conditions of application, eg smart or functional foods that claim to lower cholesterol levels or promote healthy digestion; c) claims that link conditions of production to conditions of consumption, eg organic food.

The study aims to analyse the origins and developments of what are undoubtedly close commercial relations. Using archival evidence and interviews, the study focuses on the introduction of intensive rearing technologies in British white meat farming after 1945, and, comparing with developments in the US and Australia, examines why food retailers intervened in the industry's organisation during its experimental phase, but then stopped short of acquiring ownership interests in the leading producers of intensively reared chicken and pork. Despite enormous controversy, intensive rearing has had a profound impact on meat production and retailing. From negligible beginnings in the early 1950s, poultry and pork meat rose to one third of all meat consumed in Britain by 1990. This will be the first project systematically to study the historical emergence of intensive rearing technologies and their impact on the structure of the British agricultural sector and retailing.

Its focus on groups and organisations, rather than individuals provides an often-overlooked perspective on migrant experience. The research suggests the ongoing importance of nation-states as a reference point for much social experience in a world of transnational movement.

The labour-using green revolution reduced poverty in land scarce, labour abundant Asia, but has not had sustained impacts in SSA, where scarce factor is often labour.  Now, herbicide tolerant, genetically modified (GM) white maize, is being adopted by resource-poor smallholders in KwaZulu Natal.  Whereas the Green Revolution was land saving and labour using, GM maize halves labour at planting time. If there is no land to allow expansion, employment could be halved and poverty increased, but if planting labour is the bottleneck and land is not scarce, expansion can double output, increase employment in all the other seasons and reduce poverty. So determining the factor scarcities in SSA is essential for policy makers to know if GM will result in output expansion or labour displacement. This project will try to answer this question by combining a study of the past impacts of biased technical change and factor endowments with surveys of the impacts of GM maize on employment and the incomes of small farmers in southern Africa.

The research sets out to develop and evaluate a protocol for impact assessment based on self-reported attribution without the use of comparison groups as an alternative to experimental or quasi-experimental designs based on statistically inferred attribution. The three year project, starting in September 2012, is led by James Copestake at the University of Bath, and being conducted in collaboration with three NGOs - Self Help Africa, Farm Africa, and Evidence for Development. It is jointly funded by the UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) and Department for International Development DFID. The research has three strands that will be applied to four projects: two in Ethiopia and two in Malawi. Strand 1 comprises a baseline and two rounds of annual monitoring of food security and income at the household level by NGO staff. Strand 2 comprises two rounds of annual in-depth interviewing to elicit self-reported attribution from intended project beneficiaries. Strand 3 comprises two rounds of qualitative evaluation of what Strand 2 added to the understanding of project stakeholders."	"81"	"Copestake, James"	"-1"

Financial results and drivers of behaviour will be related to business models, so as to raise questions about the buyer driven business model favoured by most of the big supermarket chains. Does vertical disintegration embed inefficiencies and transaction costs which are not visible in supermarket accounts; and is the distinctive Morrisons model of integrated meat processing a viable alternative?

This project will provide new understanding of the environmental and regulatory sustainability of deploying inundatively applied biological control agents (aka biopesticides) as alternatives to chemical pesticides. This will be addressed using entomopathogenic fungi to control aphids in leafy salad crops, a system of which the consortium has considerable expertise. The project comprises four linked objectives: to assess the obstacles to regulatory innovation for environmentally-friendly pest control within a model of the regulatory state to improve understanding of the environmental behaviour of biopesticides in relation to entomopathogen local adaptation to assess the benefit / cost contributions of biopesticides to sustainability, given constraints imposed by existing decision-making networks to compare the private governance model of pesticide reduction in the UK with its legislatively driven counterpart in Denmark. By improving understanding of key natural and social science factors affecting the deployment of alternatives to chemical pesticides, and by entering into dialogue with principal actors in the pesticide regulation system, this project will progress sustainability goals for the UK rural economy across the whole of the food chain.

In particular the total area and spatial distribution of land in different food and non-food crops, or assigned to different land management schemes, may change markedly. A key issue that emerges from this is to define the most appropriate way to distribute these different land use categories to achieve biodiversity, environmental, production and socio-economic benefits. To address this issue requires large scale, experimental approaches. This scoping study will consider what is the most appropriate protocol of such experimental studies. It will consider the design, treatments, benefits, limitations and constraints on large-scale experiments that manipulate the spatial distribution of land use. It will compare and contrast the manipulative experiment approach with information that can be obtained from observational studies of non-experimental existing changes in land use and from modelling approaches. The end product will be a set of guidelines defining appropriate protocols for the analysis of the effects of changes in the spatial distribution of alternative land uses on environmental and socio-economic factors."

This Project's starting point is that there are 'non-transport technologies' that also significantly shape travel patterns. Overall the Project presumes that social, professional and business practices orchestrate how travel intermittently occurs; and that such practices are in turn shaped by technological developments in many domains.Thus advances in building construction made it economic to build out-of-town shopping centres; and the domestic freezer made it possible to store food and facilitated weekly car-based shopping. Although such technologies are not designed to affect transport directly they give rise to extensive unintended consequences for diverse social practices and hence for travel patterns. We examine many ways in which such technologies embed themselves within existing or new social, professional and business practices and thus transform travel. This Project therefore aims first, to understand how non-transport technologies have impacted and are impacting especially indirectly upon travel, and second, to understand how practices and time-space patterns of activity could be (re)shaped by various new technologies so generating lower carbon alternatives. Focus will be upon likely future developments and scenarios within work, retailing, leisure, food and ageing. "	"81"	"Urry, Distinguis John"	"-1"

Many standards are ‘voluntary’ and have been developed and overseen by organisations from the private sector, sometimes working with non-governmental organisations (NGOs), to promote food safety and quality, good agricultural practice and labour standards. This project is concerned with private standards initiative s (PSIs) developing and monitoring these standards particularly those in developing countries.   Focusing on agri-food chains originating in Kenya , the aim is to explore what these standards and initiatives mean for 'governance' or the exercise of power.   It explores what PSIs mean for regulation, how sustainable they are and how accessible and effective they may be for poor farmers and workers. The project will develop a conceptual framework for the analysis of PSIs drawing on value chain analysis and approaches to regulation. The field work will involve in-depth qualitative study of selected Kenyan PSIs and their stakeholders using semi-structured interviews, focus groups and workshops with NGOs, government officials, horticulture firms, workers and smallholder farmers as well as European retailers and standards institutions. Focusing on fresh vegetables and cut flowers from Kenya, the project explored what private standards and initiatives mean for 'governance' or the exercise of power. It explored the power relations amongst different groups participating in or excluded from Private Standards Initiatives (PSIs) with a view to identifying which actors were most powerful and how roles were changing. The powerful role of retailers and exporters in PSIs has been highlighted, but also how new actors such as donors, NGOs (international and national), researchers and auditors have played a role in shaping these initiatives. We showed how smallholders and workers have been effectively excluded from the debates and how NGOs that seek to speak for smallholders and workers have also been constrained. The dominant narratives of retailers have shaped views of potential solutions, whilst local priorities and alternative narratives have been sidelined or remain unarticulated. Our fieldwork in Kenya demonstrated the limited ability of PSIs to instigate transformative change. There have been some improvements in how labour rights and good agricultural practices standards have been implemented and some changes to standards and audits, but transformational change has been absent.

The project consists in a number of case studies where each of them has three building blocks: supply chain farm constraints and grass-root institutions poverty impacts. The research will provide a mapping of the existing supply chains characterizing the existing market structures and domestic competition policies. At the farm level, the project studies the constraints faced by small holders to increase productivity and break a vicious cycle where low productivity exacerbates vulnerability to poverty. In a series of micro case studies, the project explores how grass-root institutions may help overcome those constraints.

This measures purchasing power parities (PPPs) and uses these to convert consumption per head measured in local currency into a common currency, conventionally the US dollar.   Unfortunately these PPP-based measures suffer from a fatal flaw as measures of living standards: they assume in effect that rich people and poor people would spend the same proportion of their incomes on (say) food if they faced the same prices. But a mass of evidence rejects this, eg we know that poor people spend a higher proportion of their household budget on food than do rich people. In general, the shares of the household budget devoted to different products vary with income and not just with prices.   This project will provide improved measures of average living standards for 146 countries covering 95 per cent of the world's population, using a recently discovered method. This new method takes the variation in budget shares due to income differences fully into account.  The ingredients of the new measures will be the same as in the World Bank's, namely the underlying data gathered by the ICP, but the resulting answers for living standards will be different.

It also aims to understand the implications of this shift for the normative foundations of the welfare state, especially in the work/welfare nexus. The US and the UK have been chosen because they are at the forefront of the shift towards ‘workfare’. Social assistance reforms that make benefit receipt conditional upon fulfilment of job search and work related activities are at the forefront of welfare retrenchment. This trend has accelerated in the second phase of activation reforms in the 2000s. Both countries have endorsed a contractual model of socio-economic rights. This has been evident in the reform of Incapacity Benefits and Income Support for single parents in the UK, especially in the controversail welfare reform Bill that is going through Parliament, and the reform of Food Stamps and the replacement of Aid to Families with Dependent Children by Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) in the US in 1996.

It hypothesises converging shifts in the evolution of the normative foundations of mature welfare states.   The research is based on an examination of congressional debates and reauthorisation proposals for TANF and Food Stamps in the US, and on the analysis of Department for Work and Pensions proposals, welfare reform legslation and parliamentary debates in the UK.    "	"81"	"Daguerre, Anne"	"-1"

It will seek to achieve this by considering a range of relevant factors: greenhouse emissions, local employment, consumer perception of relevant attributes, nutritional quality of produce and community characteristics relating to local food cultures. Environmental work will consider total contribution of greenhouse gases from production and transport of vegetables from farms in UK, Spain and Uganda. This will be measured both with standard flux boxes and a novel remote sensing technique. Life Cycle Analysis will be used to collate all relevant information from this work. Nutritional quality of fresh produce will be compared with those stored in chilled and modified atmospheres. Consumer perceptions of fruit and vegetables and the relative importance of attributes such as health benefits and place of origin will be assessed by Discrete Choice Modelling. Community and social issues will be explored in case study areas, with particular attention being paid to the sociological importance of local food cultures. A case study of the Isle of Anglesey will seek to bring all these data together in a Geographical Information System in order to assess the overall impacts of switching from existing land uses to a landscape aimed at maximising vegetable production.

"RES-000-22-0583"	"Household and Individual Consumption Decisions under Extreme Poverty"	"http://researchcatalogue.esrc.ac.uk//grants/RES-000-22-0583/read"	"2004"	"2005"	"We propose to study the consumption behaviour of households facing extreme levels of poverty. The existing literature has not systematically focussed on this especially vulnerable group and we are keen to address this gap. We are interested in analysing the consumption patterns not only of the household as a whole, but also those of individual members within the household. The research will be aimed primarily at understanding how consumption choices are made and quantifying the impact of variations in household characteristics and the broader economic environment. As explained below, this research promises to contribute significantly to both the academic literature as well as public policy. Households facing abject poverty are forced to make difficult choices. They need to decide not only how much of different goods to consume but also how to allocate chosen consumption among different members of the household. In the absence of credit markets, this process typically results in the under consumption of items that have less immediate benefits such as education. In addition, consumption tends to be diverted from less productive members, such as (female) children, towards more productive ones. From a social point of view both of these phenomena are worrying, since they may perpetuate poverty across generations. As an anti-poverty strategy, policymakers may wish to increase the consumption of particular items and/or the consumption levels of particularly vulnerable household members. In order to design policies that will meet these objectives, it is vital first to understand the existing pattern of consumption across and within poor households. As a second step, we need to determine how these consumption choices are likely to be affected by different kinds of interventions. We are confident that our research will help to shed some light on both of these issues. To conduct this analysis, we will use a unique dataset that we have collected from 122 municipalities across Colombia between July and November 2002. The dataset includes background information on individual municipalities and detailed interviews of about 11,500 households living in acute poverty. Members of the average household in our sample survive on less than $1 per day. These households are asked in-depth questions relating to many interesting aspects of their everyday life, including the number and ages of household members, daily consumption and expenditure at the household level, monthly income of individual household members and their health and education status. Our consumption data is very extensive and contains information on a wide variety of items, consisting of 96 different kinds of food and about 30 non-food items. The non-food items include transport services, personal care, household cleaning products, clothes for adults, clothes for children, health and education related expenses, furniture, entertainment, tobacco and alcohol consumption, and gambles. In addition to this household level consumption data, we also have information on the food intakes of young children. Datasets with this level of detail and coverage are not commonly available for our type of research. We plan to pursue three research directions. First, we will assess how the household consumption of different food and non-food items is affected by price and income fluctuations. We will use flexible statistical techniques that will allow us to predict how the consumption of individual items will respond to such shifts. We note that existing research is not very informative about these responses in the context of extremely poor households. Our analysis will help to assess the possible impact of particular interventions (such as cash transfers to poor households or price subsidies) which are designed to encourage the consumption of particular items such as health care that are deemed to be beneficial to the welfare of the household, at the expense of less beneficial items such as alcohol and tobacco. Second, within the household, we intend to pay particular attention to the consumption patterns of children. This focus is motivated by the fact that current consumption choices related to education, health and nutrition affect the longer-term productivity of children and hence their future ability to move out of poverty. We will also examine the relationship between these observed consumption choices and various household characteristics. Among other variables, we will pay particular attention to the roles played by the level of parental education, the relative contributions of children to household income and the bargaining power of mothers in household decision-making. Third, we intend to extend existing techniques that allow us to infer individual consumption levels from household data. Our desire to examine outcomes within the household presents some difficulties, since data on individual consumption is typically difficult to obtain.

The first group showed that globalisation, market deregulation and the spread of fast food and soft drinks are associated with more rapid increases of BMI and diabetes. Lower inequality, stronger employment protection and higher levels of work-life balance were identified as protective factors reducing BMI. The second group of studies found that the 2008 financial crisis increased the risk of suicides and deaths due to mental health disorders. Strong social protection was identified as a buffering mechanism decoupling the link between unemployment and suicides due to the crisis.     "	"81"	"Vogli, Roberto De"	"-1"

These also place a continued emphasis on understanding factors contributing to socio-economic inequalities in health. Young people from lower social class families are at greater risk of becoming overweight/obese and of eating an ‘unhealthy’ diet. Previous research by Wills and colleagues has explored diet, health and weight conceptualisations amongst families from lower social class groups with young teenagers with a range of BMIs. The current study will examine the dietary practices and health/weight conceptualisations of middle-class teenagers (aged 13-15 years), defined by their BMI as obese/overweight or non-obese/overweight. Qualitative, individual interviews will be undertaken with 36 young teenagers (18 boys and 18 girls). Interviews with parents/guardians will help situate these findings within the context of the family. To explore whether, and in what ways, class underpins perceptions and practices regarding diet, weight and health, the research will also involve a critical examination of key findings from the already completed research with lower social class families.

In contrast, relatively little is known about the types of innovation that occur in peripheral, sparsely populated areas. This research examines how innovation in some sectors may be stimulated by aspects of peripherality. For example, access to natural resources may generate innovation in sectors such as tourism, food processing or renewable energies. Similarly, the constraints of remoteness may promote the development of new methods for overcoming the difficulties and high cost of delivering services in these areas. A further focus is on the kinds of interactions that underpin innovation in peripheral areas, where linkss are likely to be national or international rather than local. Other aspects to be investigated include the influence of external market and policy factors on innovation in peripheral areas, as well as the effectiveness of policy support for innovation in such areas. The project involves interviews with policy-makers and business organisations in peripheral areas in the UK and other European countries, as well as a practitioner workshop and an academic seminar aimed at developing further research ideas.

The current knowledge/perceptions of industry and consumers will be examined, especially regarding sustainability including health benefits and food safety, costs and risks. Social and economic factors that may facilitate or obstruct consumers' propensity to access new products will be identified. The comparative advantage of domestic production compared with the potential threat of imports will be explored and sustainability concerns on SME fish farming enterprise decision-making examined. Research will be conducted both at Stirling University, with commercial partners, and along the marketing chain between producer and ultimate consumers. Techniques will involve mixed methods drawn from qualitative, quantitative and case study approaches from all the disciplines involved. These will include an assessment of production models derived from current and potential systems to identify costs and benefits of using organic, and/or traceable and locally produced feeds. Fish production units within conventional recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) will be compared with those managed as activated suspension technology units (AST) that promise to eliminate negative environmental impacts, improve efficiencies, enhance animal welfare and produce greater amenity value to rural areas. Market assessment will be explored by means of consumer focus groups and in-depth interviews with organisational channel members, including processors, retailers, foodservice and other relevant interest groups. These components will feed into current understanding in respect of production and existing perceptions of food safety, health and dietary communications. Scoping exercises, use of environmental impact assessments (EIAs), environmental health impact assessments (EHIAs) and public health impact assessments (PHIAs) will be used. A sustainability impact assessment (SIA) will then be worked up to help explore and present complex interactions and perhaps competing and conflicting results - drawing on natural and social sciences and tested by marketing. Stakeholder meetings will be used to inform those involved of the research design and outcomes and give opportunities for feedback to the research design and its use in the policy environment.

Changes in the demand for and supply of agricultural products have increased the popularity of this form of exchange in many low-income countries and it is attracting considerable policy and academic attention. While research in the 1980s and 1990s offered a mixed assessment of the extent to which contract farming engaged with and benefited smallholders, recent literature offers a more positive interpretation of smallholder involvement. This project evaluates the addition of gender-specific elements within existing contract farming operations. It evaluates whether gender-specific clauses increase the benefits smallholders and firms accrue from the relationship. In Malawi, we are working with a tobacco leaf company to evaluate the inclusion of a clause for wives to grow and market groundnuts alongside a standard tobacco contract. In Tanzania, we are working with a cotton ginnery to evaluate the inclusion of wives to grow hybrid maize alongside cotton.

Correctly visiting the box that the experimenter had not acted on cannot be explained associatively because no theory of learning posits associations between a stimulus and a lack of reinforcement.) Our pilot work has shown that children under 18 months are worse than chance on this task (visiting the acted-upon box); they are on chance at around 18 months; and are better than chance above 18 months.

Given a set of outcomes, be they the basket of foods purchased by a household or the fleet of cars produced by General Motors, economists assume that choices are the result of optimising behaviour. This has implications for observed behaviour that can be tested where suitable data is available. Revealed preference (RP) theory offers an elegant method of testing for optimising behaviour without the need to assume a functional form for preferences. In essence RP theory rules out certain combinations of choices co-existing. Generally RP tests find that economic theory performs reasonably well. But is this a triumph of economics, or a warning that RP tests are undemanding? Under certain data arrangements passing an RP test is somewhat like hitting an unmissable target; passing the test offers no support for economic theory. It would therefore be useful to have a way to report the results of RP tests that accounted for this lack of support. This research project proposes developing just such a measure using the notion of predictive success proposed by Selten and Krischker (1983) and Selten (1991) for use in evaluating the outcomes of game theory experiments.

To date, governments have sought to improve the efficiency with which contemporary 'standards' of everyday life are maintained. It is now clear that policy and governance actors have to go further and that systemic transitions in practice - in patterns of sociability and mobility, and of comfort, cleanliness, food provisioning and leisure - are also required. The fellowship aims to: 1. Develop understanding of how complex systems of practice and consumption emerge, persist and disappear - and with what consequence for the spatial and temporal ordering of daily life and the potential for mitigating or adapting to climate change. 2. Extend the range of social theoretical input to climate change policy by generating and encouraging new forms of academic and non-academic interaction. 3. Discover how social scientific analyses of systemic transitions in practice have shaped climate change policy and governance in other countries and contexts - and what lessons can be learned for the UK. Designed around a programme of research and writing, the fellowship involves running conferences, setting up a social-change climate-change working party and supervising two associated studentships.

During everyday practices, such as shopping for food, a multitude of encounters with the 'Other' occur, without being recognized as such. Research on small grocery stores and their customers in Germany suggests that the alleged globalisation of consumption patterns does not always lead to cultural homogenisation. There is growing evidence that local consumption cultures are resilient to change or develop alternative trajectories to the economic mainstream. These insights are to be brought into the public realm by articles and conference papers as well as presentations aimed at local authorities, chambers of commerce and shopkeepers in the UK and Germany. Researching everyday practices and places proved to be highly productive of new insights. To take this approach further the fellow will seek to secure funding for subsequent research projects and improve the likely outcomes of the research through personal development and training. The achievement of these different strands of work will hopefully cumulate to a position which allows the fellow to formulate and develop further critical research into the realm of everyday practices and places."

But these simple plants are incredibly diverse and are found in all aquatic habitats including lakes, rivers and oceans, even the soil. They are of immense importance to global CO2 fixation, since it is estimated that marine species of algae account for about half of the world’s photosynthesis. There is currently considerable interest in exploiting these organisms for biofuel production: they grow much faster than land-based plants, some species can accumulate very high amounts (>50% dry weight) of oil, and they do not compete with food crops. However, there are many different hurdles that must be overcome before algal biofuels can be commercially viable, not least that our understanding of algal biology lags behind that of higher plants."

This project aims at explaining why the demand for durables experiences a temporary increase around retirement and a substantial decline at older ages. The empirical regularities shall be investigated in detail using three separate UK datasets - the Expenditure and Food Survey, the British Household Panel Survey and the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. The key questions in this project are: Durable purchases at retirement: do households postpone durables purchases before retirement and use lump-sum payments received upon retirement to replace and renew their household appliances and consumer electronics? Do complementarities between durables and leisure affect purchase behaviour around retirement? Durable purchases beyond retirement: how can we explain the large drop in durables expenditures at older ages? Do households rationally take into account their life expectancy when making durables replacement decisions?  "	"81"	"Luehrmann, Melanie"	"-1"

This manipulation or ‘implementation intentions’, has been shown to increase the likelihood that various behaviours are performed. However, the long-term efficacy of this technique has rarely been tested, and where it has, the results have been mixed. Moreover, there have been few attempts to strengthen the impact of this manipulation. Termed ‘collaborative implementation intentions’, Prestwich et al. (2005) modified standard implementation intention interventions by requiring individuals to decide, with another person, the context in which they will enact behaviour together. In this study, collaborative implementation intentions were particularly effective in promoting breast self-examinations over one month. The current research will examine the efficacy of individual verses collaborative implementation intentions in promoting two health behaviours. Furthermore, the mechanisms through which the interventions change behaviour will be examined in order to design and develop new, effective health behaviour strategies in the future. The research will employ two randomized controlled trials, focused on exercise promotion and the reduction of high-fat food intake, in samples of council workers over a six month period.

In the long run, the ratios of these prices to the overall consumer price index have altered because of technological changes and globalization, among other factors. For example, the prices of internationally traded consumer goods have fallen relative to prices of services. By building separate models for the components, the long-run information in the data and specific economic features likely to drive each component can be exploited. These models will test for asymmetries, such as the tendency of petrol prices to respond faster to rises than to falls in oil prices. The models should help better understand the causes of overall inflation through understanding the inflation trends of the underlying sectors. Modelling the components separately should also highlight where interest rate policy could be effective, and where other policies such as competition policy or price regulation might have complementary benefits.

The first set consists of analytical challenges about the effect that the recognition of welfare rights has on the integrity of rights discourse. The second includes worries about the enforcement of welfare rights, and their amenability to constitutional entrenchment. This project assesses, analyses, and responds to objections by emphasising both the potentially extensive list of unattainable rights and the belief that in practice their recognition would be politically divisive, conflict with other more important rights or values, or be simply impossible. It draws on recent legal and philosophical literature about the nature of rights, as well as the experiences of states, like India, South Africa and Canada, that are at the forefront in the development of welfare-rights jurisprudence. What emerges from the analysis is an account of welfare rights that preserves their ‘analytical cutting edge’ and a defence of constitutional welfare rights as both justiciable and enforceable.

While this clearly implies increasing the productivity of finite resources, there are widely differing views as to how this may be achieved without degrading or destroying the bio-ecological foundations on which agricultural productivity depends. In the absence of exogenous growth in productivity arising from technical change, this implies a need to develop strategies for sustainable intensification. Such sustainability represents one possible future option for land use in a UK and European context. This investigation is a preliminary empirical study of three areas representing three major agro-ecosystems (upland agriculture, lowland grassland and intensive arable farming). The study sets out to delineate the habitat types in each area and to determine how dynamic intensification processes might (or might not) be sustainably supported. It is establishing what data are available to describe these economic and ecological processes and exploring how they might be used to construct and test alternative models of the agro-ecological systems.

"http://researchcatalogue.esrc.ac.uk//grants/ES.J009008.1/read"	"2012"	"2016"	"When promoting new agricultural technologies in developing countries lead farmers, -farmers who implement demonstration plots of a new technology-, learn about the best way to implement the technology and should share this information with others. Whether actually selected farmers are well placed for these tasks is often not known, and selecting differently may have profound effects on technology diffusion and impact of development programs. This is investigated empirically in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Together with local field officers promoting the use of improved crop varieties, current selection methods, and their shortcomings in reaching various (vulnerable) subgroups, have been identified. The shortcomings are used to design an improved selection method. The current and improved selection methods are each implemented in 30 randomly selected villages. Before and after the intervention detailed data is collected at village and household level, building an understanding if and when the improved method leads to enhanced diffusion of knowledge on new varieties. Additional analyses provide detailed insights in technology diffusion through social networks. This research allows agricultural development programs to increase their reach amongst rural African smallholders, and/or better targeting vulnerable subgroups in rural societies."

Yet the links between  agricultural productivity and non-farm employment are poorly understood. Recent debates indicate that the multipliers that can support non-farm rural employment depend not only on growth in local aggregate demand, but also on the spatial and institutional configuration of the links between farm and non-farm employment, and between near and distant markets.  This project will explore the spatial and institutional articulation of markets, human settlements and farm and non-farm livelihoods in marginalised and impoverished regions of Malawi, South Africa and Zimbabwe. It will do this by building a careful qualitative picture of the flow and distribution of money, resources, risk and opportunities in socio-economic networks, value chains and markets in rural districts.  This qualitative picture will be combined with a detailed quantitative analysis of the livelihood outcomes for actors and role players in the network.

One aspect of this transformation is how these economies are challenging the rules that govern international trade and global production, in particular global environmental and labour standards. For the developing world, meeting international standards is increasingly critical. We are now more aware about the food we eat and how it came to our plates, or whether what we wear implied sweatshop labour. Yet, gains from compliance - especially for workers and poor producers - remain unclear. Expanding trade between the RP economies, their growing domestic consumer markets and the emergence of leading firms from China, India and Brazil raise questions on how global standards will be shaped in the future, who the key drivers will be, and what implications arise for small producers and poor workers in the developing world. Understanding these processes, and their policy implications, are important if we are to avert a 'race to the bottom' with declining labour and environmental standards. The Rising Powers and Global Standards (RPGS) Research Network assembles an international group of experienced researchers and policy actors to formulate a comparative research programme to address this agenda.

This period is expected by all sides to be one of renewed controversy and interest in the UK, with a government initiated national debate, discussion of the GM crop field trial results, and reconsideration of the current moratorium on commercial cultivation. Although it is impossible to predict either the exact course or duration of the debate, it is certain to provide a wealth of material for research into the impact of stakeholders communication strategies upon public trust and understanding. Recently, the GM debate has generated a great deal of research and publication. The proposed project, however, is distinctive for its attention to the language and discourse of the debate, and for its combination of linguistic and sociological methodology. The GM debate brings together scientific, ethical, political and social concerns. Each perspective has its own discourse, and this in itself can be a source of misunderstanding and disagreement. The research will focus less upon the content of the debate, as other research has done, and more upon the forms in which it is expressed, as well as ways in which it is framed by its actors. It will explore how styles of argument, metaphors and analogies, phrases and single words can change in meaning and effect when they cross discoursal boundaries. As such, it will make a unique contribution to understanding of the public debate, and be of value and relevance to all stakeholders, interested academics, and society in general. More generally it will provide insights into the communication of controversial new technology and the responses of both public, media, and policy makers. For this purpose, the project will collect, analyse and relate three datasets. The first will be an electronically stored corpus of newspaper articles and public statements by major stakeholders (such as NGOs, government, and biotechnology companies). This first datatset can be automatically analysed using current corpus linguistic software to reveal frequent word choices and combinations. The second dataset will be transcripts of interviews with representatives of major stakeholder organisations about the factors governing their choices of language and strategies of argumentation. This second dataset will be coded using software for qualitative analysis, to reveal recurrent themes and opinions. The third dataset will be transcriptions of six focus groups, meeting on two occasions each, in which participants react to the language choices and communicative styles of selected extracts from dataset one. Focus groups have been chosen for the depth which they allow in the exploration of views and opinions among targeted groups with a particular relation to the topic. In our research each group identity will relate to one area of the debate, as follows: parents of young children (diet and health); charity volunteers (ethical concerns); students in higher education (long term effects); birdwatchers (biodiversity); farmers (consequences for agriculture); temporary UK residents from poor countries (effect on crop nutrition and yield). The intention is not to provide a survey of opinion, of which many already exist, nor to duplicate the existing focus-group literature on public responses to GM, but to provide new evidence of the discoursal sources of conflict and mistrust. This third dataset will also be coded for themes and arguments. This research will elucidate the actual (rather than presumed) effect of styles of argument on public perceptions and trust, thus complimenting and deepening existing understanding "	"81"	"Cook, Guy"	"-1"

There has been substantial interest in the topic of engagement on the part of practitioners, particularly in the wake of the UK government's 2009 MacLeod Review highlighting the benefits of an engaged workforce. The aim of this series is to bring together academics, policymakers and practitioners to debate and discuss employee engagement, to bolster the UK research base on the topic, and to disseminate academic research on engagement to a wide audience. The series comprises four seminars, starting on 8 February 2011 at Kent University. A special issue of the International Journal of Human Resource Management is linked with the series.

Most models fail in the testing procedures because estimates do not satisfy properties of theoretical demand models. For example, if demand for a commodity depends upon its price, prices of other commodities and money income, then equal proportionate changes in income and prices must leave the level of demand unchanged. Demand equations are said to be homogenous of degree zero in income and prices. Most empircal studies of demand systems fail this first elementary test. There have been a number of reasons put forward for this failure and recently the argument that some (or all) of the variables in the systems are ""non-stationary"". That is, variables like prices appear, over time, to be generated by a process something like ""the price of carrots this week is equal to the price of carrots last week plus a random error"". Such a process is called a random walk and variables which are generated by such processes have to be treated using special methods. These methods do appear to be more successful, but not completely so. Reasons for their failure could be attributed to the impact of population growth or shifting trends, such as tastes, whch are rarely built explicitly into the models. This project intends to investigate two demand system specifications, which have been shown to give a great deal of flexibility in satisfying demand properties. The systems are called the Almost Ideal Demand Model and the Translog System. These systems will be investigated using aggregate demand data on such commodities as food and drink, alcohol and tobacco, clothing and footwear, health, communication, education and recreation and culture, applying techniques for non-stationary variables and allowing for population changes and shifting trends. The models will be compared by their estimates and their forecasting performance "	"81"	"Attfield, C"	"-1"

Experiments in Appropriate Technology"	"http://researchcatalogue.esrc.ac.uk//grants/RES-332-25-0005/read"	"2003"	"2005"	"Technological choices are influenced by a logic that derives from the accumulated knowledge, past investments and established technological practices. This tendency is called the technological regime. Regimes lead innovations along particular trajectories. Studies into past regime shifts (creating a new selection logic) identify the importance of novel niches in the development and use of the radically-different techniques that became the succeeding regime. A tension between diverse niches and the tendency for regimes to reduce diversity has been recognised by analysts. Maintaining a degree of diversity has been recommended on positive and normative grounds: diversity promotes innovation, and insures against unsustainable technological ‘lock-in’. However, little has been said about how diversity could be supported and harnessed. It is a gap in knowledge which this proposal intends to fill. The proposal uses a novel methodology (niche experiments) to test theory in the Strategic Niche Management (SNM) of transitions toward sustainable technological regimes. Real-world experiments in appropriate technology (AT) are analysed as though they were deep green niches existing within unsustainable technological regimes. Three sustainable niche case studies will be analysed: local organic food initiatives; low-impact housing; and wind energy. The evolution of these niches will be analysed. Evidence of niche influence on the incumbent regime will be assessed by examining niche growth and/or links with the incumbent regime. To this end, SNM techniques will be used critically to assess whether technological, organisational and institutional reforms could help the niches flourish and become practised more widely, and to test the viability of using niches in transition management to sustainable technological regimes. If viable, practical, policy-oriented recommendations about methods for supporting and harnessing diversity will be a key project output. "	"81"	"Smith, Adrian"	"-1"

However, despite billions invested in rural handpumps one in three handpumps do not work in rural Africa. This represents a huge wasted investment and is associated with high but avoidable health, welfare and livelihood costs. Encouragingly, the risk of handpump breakdown bears all the hallmarks of an insurable risk. A recent technological breakthrough by researchers at Oxford University makes an insurance model now feasible. Like any insurance model premiums are lower with more handpumps as they spread the risk across all users. What is not clear is how much users would pay and what level of maintenance service they would want. Linking consumer demand with insurance supply will then provide a credible basis to test such a new handpump insurance product in the next phase of the research. There is a lot of excitement and interest in the research with the project partners including the Government of Kenya, United Nations Children Foundation (UNICEF) and mobile phone companies and operators (GSMA). If this project is successful it could help the 276 million rural Africans access safe and reliable water to make their lives and futures healthy and wealthier. That would be good news for everyone."

India is a supplier of agricultural products to the UK supermarkets which base their sourcing, on networks of producers. This provides new trade and employment opportunities for small farmers and workers. But, they also face serious commercial pressures, risk, and vulnerability and those unable to meet the standards are largely excluded from such supply chains. Research into the implications of supermarket sourcing in India is limited. Global production network (GPN) analysis provides a framework for examining the dynamics and implications of supermarket sourcing for small farmers and workers. It analyses the way lead firms coordinate production, distribution, and retailing globally and emphasises the complexity, power imbalances, and social aspects of global production. Analysis of upgrading examines constraints and opportunities for small producers and workers to enhance their position through value creation, value capture, and value distribution. This helps address important questions for India: can supermarket chain access promote economic and social upgrading for small farmers and workers, and what strategies would enhance gains which is the main objective of the scoping study on UK supermarket sourcing from India and implications for upgrading at the farmer and the worker levels under this exchange."

One obvious solution is to reduce meat and milk consumption but this is unlikely to be acceptable to everyone. Moreover, grass-fed animals can provide other benefits than food, such as managing biodiversity. The UK has a good climate for producing grass and many of the upland regions of the UK cannot be used for cultivating anything other than grass. Grazing animals therefore provide the backbone of many rural communities. A range of different animal breeding technologies (including but not limited to genetic modification) could be used to mitigate the global warming impact of farm livestock, but adoption of these may be limited by willingness of farmers to purchase these replacement breeding animals. The aim of this project is to: understand how farmers reach decisions on where to source replacement breeding animals; understand how the whole system of producing replacement breeding animals impacts on the decisions made by farmers; evaluate what changes could be made to encourage the uptake of animals bred for reduced global warming impact.

A strategy was developed that focused on:  LAs shifting more from service provision towards community support Building community resilience Creating infrastructure and processes to help community action Supporting poorer communities Strategically altering budget distributions because of financial constraints and investment potential in renewables Raising awareness through seeing LA as a community of interest. Despite the different cultures between LAs and communities, in both, key individuals played important leadership roles.

Research has shown that people in contemporary Western societies are motivated to see themselves positively (the self-esteem motive), as distinguished from others (the distinctiveness motive), persisting through time (the continuity motive), accepted by others (the belonging motive), competent and capable (the efficacy motive), and having meaning and purpose (the meaning motive). However, researchers have debated the relevance of these motives to people in non-Western cultures - the majority of the world’s population. We conducted two large-scale survey studies measuring the strengths of identity motives, sources of motive satisfaction, and cultural beliefs and values, among 14,000 participants across 38 nations. Supporting a middle way between ‘universalist’ and ‘relativist’ perspectives, identity motives varied little in strength, but ways of satisfying each motive varied considerably with beliefs and values across diverse cultural groupings. Thus, a common set of motives underlies the different expressions and outcomes of identity observed across cultures. This improved understanding may be beneficial to practitioners in domains from psychotherapy to education, health promotion, business management, social cohesion, and international relations.

The variation in management between farms is known to be an important determinant of biodiversity and one of the key objectives was to understand the basis for this. Ecological models are also used to predict how weed and bird populations will respond to changes in management practices.

Agri-environment schemes (AES) encourage farmers to carry out management which should lead to increases in wildlife. However, AES do not always give the desired results. This failure has been linked to both social and ecological problems. Firstly, if farmers have poor understanding of the science and aims of AES, they may not carry out the best management. Secondly, management may create the environments that certain plant and animal species need, but their ability to colonise these habitats may be limited by both the rarity of these species in the landscape, and obstacles to movement in modern landscapes. This is a five year study of how well wildlife habitats are created under AES, and whether training of farmers leads to creation of better habitats. This will be linked to studies of how farmer’s attitudes to wildlife-friendly farming may be shifted by training. Secondly, we will analyse how the distribution of species and habitat types in wider landscape affects colonisation of new habitats.

During this project sociological, historical and comparative data will be used to enhance the theoretical coherence and investigate the social scientific value of the concepts of ‘creolization’ and ‘hybridity’, as well as highlighting their limits.

A factor that is little understood is how these depend on the scale and concentration of alternative farming systems across the landscape, from local up to the national scale. This project addresses two key questions: What causes organic farms to be arranged in clusters at local, regional and national scales, rather than be spread more evenly throughout the landscape? Assess how the ecological, hydrological, socio-economic and cultural impacts of organic farming may vary due to neighbourhood effects at a variety of scales. The project will undertake an intensive study of existing clustered and isolated organic farms, and their surrounding neighbourhoods, to address these questions. It will culminate in mapping out some alternative scenarios for future growth of the organic sector in the UK, and evaluate the potential positive and negative effects that different patterns of organic cultivation might have, at a variety of scales, in the future.

The principal investigators are Stan Siebert and Xiangdong Wei (Lingnan University, Hong Kong), with John Heywood of Wisconsin-Milwaukee as co-investigator. The aim is to find the root of China's world-beating productivity, and in particular to assess how the company has adapted to China's relatively high levels of labour regulation. (as measured, for example, by the World Bank's current Ease of Doing Business Report). The company is experimenting with various innovative labour practices such as team-working and incentive pay schemes, and the results will be tracked. A further aspect of the research is assessing the consequences of these practices for workers, by conducting periodic job satisfaction surveys. The project addresses central concerns of personnel economics and strategic human resource researchers. The evidence on the high performance paradigm tends to be distorted by omission of the management ability factor which our quasi-experimental approach avoids. In fact, our results may well not support the paradigm, or support a ""contingency"" view whereby high performance practices improve outcomes when applied to some worker groups (eg full-timers), but not when applied to others.

Premised on the idea that governance cannot eliminate all adverse outcomes, risk-based approaches take into account both the probability as well as the impact of potential adverse governance outcomes. In so doing, such approaches provide a means of rationalising the limits of what governance interventions can, and should, achieve. However, such approaches embody particular understandings about the meaning of governance 'failure' and 'success' and as such can conflict with governance norms and accountability structures as well as societal expectations. HowSAFE will undertake a comparative investigation of the factors shaping the adoption of risk-based approaches to governance across six policy domains-occupational health and safety, flooding, food-safety, healthcare, criminal justice and education - in four European countries-France, Germany, Netherlands and UK. In so doing, it will: document the application of risk-based governance across policy domains and national settings compare the application of risk instruments within and between policy domains explain the factors driving and constraining risk-based governance in Europe, and will reflect more broadly on how states account for failure and the limits of governance.   "	"81"	"Rothstein, Henry"	"-1"

The project will include consideration of the roles of experts and non-experts in the field, how they use evidence, and how they influence policy decisions. Innogen Centre staff have been closely involved in analysing and commenting on these areas of policy since the early 1990s when there was still considerable uncertainty about the safety of GM crops to people and the environment. The expectation at that time was that the precautionary approach would be modified if and when evidence of the safety and efficacy of GM crops became available.

The UK from the 1940s to the 1970s underwent a far reaching transformation of its farming industry. Much of the technical innovation associated with this was already available in pre-war years. Moreover, some of the cost-price pressures on agriculture that limited productivity in the 1930s were equally present post-war. Why then were there such changes in agriculture in the post-war period? Using evidence from the farm field books of the Farm Management Survey, this research will look at changes in productivity and technical innovation. This will be combined with oral history interviews with farmers, or their successors, who participated in the FMS in the 1950s and 1960s.

For Defra and the EA, the challenge is to improve, simplify, consolidate and even remove environmental regulations, while achieving at least equivalent outcomes for the environment, society and the economy. Academic research can offer useful guidance on how to tackle this challenge through providing evidence on the impacts, costs and benefits of various approaches to environmental regulation. Professor Bowen specialises in company responses to environmental regulation, and the fellowship will allow her to share her expertise with Defra, the EA and other government departments.

The public reception of and feelings towards this new kind of science is very different in different European countries. In Britain the general attitude is a very sceptical one, whereas for example in Scandinavia people display a cautious optimism. One of the things that influences the publics image of a specific research field is how the scientists and their work appears to the world outside the laboratory. Naturally this image is communicated via the media, but the journalists accounts are dependent, at least in part, on what scientists actually do. The aim of the research is therefore not to discuss the media, but to explore how the scientists working conditions might shape the representation of science. The proposed research will examine how the same scientific field - bio-science - has come across so differently to the public in Britain and Sweden. Special attention will be given to how dissenting scientists are treated. In Sweden there is a tradition of including adverse scientists into the research communities, thereby making the debate internal to science and keeping it within the family. In Britain on the other hand, scientists who diverge from the orthodox view tend to be excluded from the scientific communities they have previously worked in. This moves the debate into a different domain and gives it the form of a public row between clearly defined outsiders and insiders. To examine this differing tolerance for dissent, research institutions of three different types - universities, free-standing institutes that take on commissioned research , and private firms - will be studied in Britain and Sweden respectively. Initially documents relating to each countrys research infra-structure will be analysed, together with material that will give an overall picture of the employment conditions in the different institutions, for example contracts of employment and forms relating to intellectual property. In the following phase interviews with scientists of different ranks, human resource personnel and public relation officers working within the six institutions will be conducted. In the third phase of the project the compiled material will be analysed, follow-up interviews conducted and the conclusions of the research will be presented in the form of report and one or more research articles placed in relevant peer-reviewed journals. The research should be a valuable input to the ongoing discussion over the public image of science and the impact of work practices on this image "	"81"	"Eriksson, Anna"	"-1"

A surge of so-called out-of-town development of food stores, retail warehouses and shopping centres has revolutionised shopping travel, but in recent years many town and city centres have also experienced a revival of shopping and leisure activities. Many of these changes have been influenced by central and local government policies which seek to control retail change in the interests of better town planning. Yet these policies have changed markedly over time. They have attempted to respond to new policy priorities such as sustainable development and social inclusion, but in so doing have met criticism from many angles, not least retail and consumer interests themselves. This research project aims to provide a detailed record of how, and why, town planning policies for retailing have changed since the late 1960s. Sources of information will include a variety of published and unpublished written material, and the views (recorded in interviews) of a small number of senior practitioners. The research will go on to develop a framework by which existing and possible future planning policies can be judged for the ways in which they can meet the needs of retailers, consumers and the wider public. This stage of the project will benefit from previous and current research by the applicant, which has focussed on issues such as the requirements of retailers who trade from large stores, and the potential for new retail development to improve the position of people faced with poor quality shops and difficult transport arrangements. The main outcome from the research will be a new book which will describe and explain the ways in which retail planning policy has developed in the UK. It will explain how policy has responded to wider concerns such as the protection of town centres, and the need to observe principles of sustainable development. It will be argued however that in following these principles, other government objectives such as promoting innovation and competition in retailing, and protecting the interests of the socially excluded, have sometimes been ignored. The book will review these arguments in depth and will suggest ways in which policy objectives can be reconciled "	"81"	"Guy, C"	"-1"

Transformations of Work: New Frontiers and Temporalities"	"http://researchcatalogue.esrc.ac.uk//grants/RES-051-27-0015/read"	"2004"	"2007"	"There is a general recognition that the world of work is undergoing major transformations in a period of increasing globalisation, with the decline of standard forms of employment, the emergence of new patterns of combining work with other activities, and the re-location of work within societies outside of standard work-places. In order to understand such changes, the Fellowship aims to develop a broad conception both of what constitutes work and of the interconnectedness of work with non-work activities within an overall societal framework spanning production, service provision, distribution, retailing and consumption. Changes in one area impact on changes in others, and on how work activities are temporally intercoordinated and coordinated with non-work activities. A work activity undertaken in paid employment can shift to non-paid work or voluntary work, whilst at the same time changing in terms of process and what it produces. One main objective of the Fellowship is to review and synthesise all relevant recent empirical and theoretical work across several disciplines. This will be supported by, and linked with, four empirical research probes pinpointing key questions about the interactions and shifts between paid employment and various modes of unpaid work. Each probe targets different aspects of interconnectedness. The first explores the interaction between work activities in paid employment and in the household involved in food preparation and consumption: where work is done, how and by whom, and under what temporal coordinations. The second targets the role of voluntary work in caring (for the elderly, sick, disabled, children) where there are significant and changing differences between European countries in how paid, unpaid, and formally organised voluntary work are interconnected. The third probe will explore how the emergence and global distribution of call centres both creates new forms of work and changes the nature of work upstream and downstream of the centres themselves. The fourth probe opens up a relatively new empirical field by exploring the unpaid work and skills acquisition necessary for consumption and their interconnection with paid employment provisioning for consumption. In empirically exploring transformations of work, this project will therefore focus on the new and shifting frontiers between paid and unpaid, formal and informal, work activities, and between work and consumption. An original and comprehensive theoretical framework will be developed as a central aim of the research programme to embrace this diversity and change in the nature and place of work in contemporary societies "	"81"	"Glucksmann, Miriam"	"-1"

To answer the first research question the wealth (and each of its components) of families in 2008-09 will be compared to that of the same families in 2006-07. This will allow the documentation of the groups of individuals who were relatively exposed to the crisis. Both the second and the third research question will require the estimation of the 'effects' of the crisis. This will be done both by examining how the outcomes of interest evolve as the crisis developed during 2008-09 and by comparing the outcomes of groups affected by the crisis with groups that are relatively unaffected by the crisis.   "	"81"	"Emmerson, Carl"	"-1"

The women who fulfilled this role were typically married women or housewives. The term housewife was also used in early modern England (the period 1500-1800) to describe such women, although their work (housewifery) differed from that of modern housewives as a result of rural, agricultural nature of the economy. There has been no detailed study of the work of housewives in the period before 1800. Historians assume that housewives work differed because men also worked in and around the home and farm, but also assume the women were the primary consumers as they are in modern society: we cannot know whether these assumptions are correct unless we investigate the kind of work that went on within the household (including the work of acquiring goods and feeding household members), and who did that work. This is what this project proposes to do. Such a study will also have relevance to modern social science, by showing whether patterns of work and consumption observed in the 19th and 20th centuries were new, or whether they existed in the previous pre-industrial era under investigation here. The project will use a series of household account books kept by a Norfolk gentlewoman, Alice Le Strange, in a continuous series between 1610 and 1653. These books record on a week by week basis the food purchased or produced at home, and then consumed by the household, as well as all expenditure on household items, servant labour and building work, and household income from various sources. The detailed study of this household will be set in the context of wider social and economic changes, showing how household work, the division of labour between men and women, and consumption patterns changed over time. The 17th century was a period of rapid commercialisation within traditional structures: the range of goods available for purchase increased considerably, but most production was still carried out in the home and in rural households. This makes it a particularly interesting period to examine. Because the documents form a continuous series, it is also possible to see how patterns of consumption change over a period of just over 40 years in one household, according the age, wealth and number of people in the household. Other types of documents will be used to provide more details about servants and local farming families who were drawn into the Le Stranges household economy by providing labour or goods for purchase. This will allow contrasts to be drawn between the wealthy lifestyle of a gentry family and the much more modest prospects of ordinary people, demonstrating how consumption and work patterns varied with status and wealth as well as over time "	"81"	"Whittle, Jane"	"-1"
"RES-000-23-0114"	"Trust in Advisors: Origins, Effects, and Implications for Risk Communication"	"http://researchcatalogue.esrc.ac.uk//grants/RES-000-23-0114/read"	"2003"	"2006"	"It is now well recognised that trust in sources of advice is important for effective risk communication. To maintain some influence over peoples opinions and risk-taking behaviours, government departments, medical bodies and other agencies must endeavour to maintain the trust that people have in them. When trust is lost, so is influence. As an example of this, commentators have pointed to effects of poor advice during the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow) crisis. The government assured people that it was safe to eat beef but later this behaviour was later linked to a brain disease that is always fatal. This reduced trust in the government as a source of advice about risk for many people. As a result, there appears to be a reluctance to take government advice on other matters. For example, the number of measles cases has increased in many parts of the country: fewer people are having their children vaccinated against the disease because they do not believe the governments assurances that the MMR vaccine is safe. Recently, Onora ONeill, in her 2002 Reith lectures, has argued that we should be cautious about accepting peoples claims that they have lost trust in some agency as evidence that they have actually lost their trust in it. For example, she suggests that many people who say they no longer trust supermarket food still shop in supermarkets rather than elsewhere. For her, it is important to make a distinction between stated trust and actual trust. Our aim is to find out more about trust by answering a number of questions about it while keeping ONeills distincion in mind. What determines trust? How should it be measured? Does it have similar effects on peoples estimates about levels of risk and their risk-related behaviours? How valid is the view that it is easier to destroy than to create trust? Is trust in advisors modified in a rational way? If not, what determines how it is modified? Does trust (or lack of it) transfer across domains? Answers to these questions should be relevant to many of the concerns of those responsible for the development of effective risk communication strategies in government, business and non-profit-making organizations. This is a proposal for systematic studies to answer these questions. In simulated situations, people will be required to assess levels of risk associated with various hazards on the basis of information received from advisors. Advice will be attributed to different sources, such as government departments and consumer organizations. Its quality will be under our control. We shall be able to measure actual trust in an advisor (in terms of the degree to which peoples own risk judgments depend on the risk estimate provided by that advisor) and stated trust in that advisor (in terms of a trust rating). We shall be able to determine how these measures depend on quality of previous advice from that source and on other variables, such as the degree to which judges perceive their values to be similar to those of the advisor "	"81"	"Harvey, Nigel"	"-1"

Her first research focus is on examining the development of flexibility in infrastructure design to better manage unforeseeably changing circumstances. In her research paper, flexibility is illustrated as an important value driver for hospital infrastructures by way of case studies. She also lays out a stylised example of articulating the value of flexibility to make an economic case for a flexible infrastructure. Her second, more technical research stream studies an empirically-based framework for modelling the underlying uncertainty, which is robust against the assumptions about the data generating process. The framework is based on choosing a “black box” that generates point forecasts and applying this black box to subsamples of past data to collect the past forecast errors associated with the chosen box. The empirical forecast errors are then used to draw inferences about future uncertainty. In her research papers, she analyses this approach and illustrates its effectiveness in time-series forecasting as well as inventory management applications. Her current research project extends the problem of making efficient decisions in the face of uncertainty, in particular making inventory decisions under demand uncertainty, in a controlled behavioural laboratory environment. Forecasting critical fractiles of the lead time demand distribution is an important problem for operations managers making newsvendor-type inventory decisions. In this paper, we propose a semi-parametric approach to forecasting the critical fractile when demand is serially correlated. Starting from a user-defined but potentially misspecified forecasting model, we use historical demand data to generate empirical forecast errors of this model. These errors are then used to (1) parametrically correct for any bias in the point forecast conditional on the recent demand history and (2) non-parametrically estimate the critical fractile of the demand distribution without imposing distributional assumptions. I present conditions under which this semi-parametric approach provides a consistent estimate of the critical fractile and evaluate its finite sample properties using simulation and real data for retail inventory planning. We tested finite sample performance of the semiparametric approach using simulated data and empirical retail data. In general, the sample size of n>150 is recommended to achieve credible accuracy. Forecasting critical fractiles of the lead time demand (LTD) distribution is an important problem for operations managers making newsvendor-type inventory decisions. Demand autocorrelation is found to be present in numerous practical settings, such as consumer goods, fuel, food and machine tools and failure to model demand autocorrelation can have negative effect on the stockout rate experienced by a firm. I present a robust methodology that can forecast critical fractiles when demand is serially correlated. Other"	"81"	"Lee, Yun Shin"	"-1"

We will test this proposition by constructing a stylised representation of an upland region (the Northumberland National Park) as a BBN. How complicated do we need to make the BBN representation to credibly capture the critical nodes and relationships as far as stakeholders are concerned? Is this credible simplification sufficiently manageable to be capable of systematic manipulation, communication and analysis?  We will then calibrate our system to represent a previously examined case study area. With this calibrated BBN of a known case, we should be able to replicate the major findings of this previous research, without substantial reference to additional input or interpretation from the specific expertise employed in the original project. If so, then this represents a substantial test of the methodological approach. "	"81"	"Harvey, David"	"-1"

The aim of this proposal is to explore the role of causal framing in decision making from the psychological perspective. Participants will be exposed to different decision scenarios in laboratory setting, thereby revealing the mental process of causal reasoning in decision making under uncertainty. The process may include three stages: constructing the causal frame of a decision problem; simplifying the constructed causal frame of the problem; probabilistic reasoning through the simplified causal frame. How people perform in these stages and what practical implications may be drawn will be the primary interests in this proposal.

Most recently one of these, low dose simvastatin, has become available over the counter (OTC), for people at 'moderate' risk of heart disease (10-15 per cent over 10 years). This product, marketed as Zocor Heart Pro, is unique among drugs licensed for sale without prescription in the UK in being intended for prevention rather than treatment, as was the first product of its kind in the world. Yet little is known about the characteristics of consumers, or would-be consumers, nor about what 'use' means in this context. This exploratory project aims to investigate these concerns through five key research questions: What factors shape the decision to purchase or try to purchase OTC statins? How do OTC statins fit in with other attempts to prevent heart troubles or preserve health? What does 'use' mean in this context? (how often, for how long?) How far do these accounts support 'self-care' and health consumer agendas? What are the implications for policy concerning the regulation of non-prescription drugs in the future?

Participation included natural and social scientists, plus policy and communications professionals and artists. Yet they went further to explore the ethical implications of research as much as the work itself: What kinds of response/responsibilities are implied by new knowledge in these fields, not just for the policy community, but also for researchers? Environmental policy and political debates have drawn freely on a stock of environmentalist rhetoric regarding interconnections. The academic community, while more wary and often critical of this rhetoric, are nursing similar assumptions and commitments, albeit implicitly. The seminar series worked to reveal these and reflect upon their consequences. The series of seminars invited participants to work with both broad theoretical work and specific cases to probe the significance of notions of interdependence.

This comprised: 33 children (aged under 18) and young adults (aged 18-24) with caring responsibilities 33 parents/relatives with HIV and guardians 27 service providers. Alongside in-depth interviews, participatory methods such as photography and life story books, with sentence completion exercises, diary of a typical day and spaces for drawing, were used with children to gain insight into their caring experiences. A book, published by The Policy Press, provides full details of the study. "	"81"	"Becker, Saul"	"-1"
"RES-000-22-1732"	"Hidden Young Carers: The experiences, needs and resilience of children caring for parents or relatives with HIV/ AIDS in"	"http://researchcatalogue.esrc.ac.uk//grants/RES-000-22-1732/read"	"2006"	"2006"	"This thirteen-month study, commencing in April 2006, is the first cross-national research enquiry to investigate the experiences, needs and resilience of children and young people caring for parents or relatives with HIV/AIDS (‘young carers’) in Tanzania and the UK. The research will explore the similarities and differences in the experiences of this hidden group of young carers. It aims to develop an understanding of children’s everyday experiences of unpaid care work in families affected by HIV/AIDS: the push and pull factors influencing whether and why they take on care-giving tasks; the outcomes for children and families the factors that can reduce children’s vulnerability to negative outcomes and promote their ‘resilience’ caring relationships within families how young carers can best be supported in terms of policy and social welfare practice. The child-focused methodology acknowledges children’s active roles in constructing their caring roles and the social determinants which influence these. The experiences of young carers, parents/relatives and key professionals will be explored using in-depth interviews and participatory methods with children. The study builds on Prof Becker’s pioneering and long-standing research on young carers in the UK and Dr Evans’ research on children and families’ resilience in relation to HIV/AIDS in Tanzania. Summary of project findings Despite very different socio-economic, cultural and policy contexts, children caring for parents with HIV in Tanzania and the UK share many similarities in terms of their everyday caring responsibilities, needs and aspirations. Children performed a range of caring tasks in the UK and Tanzania:  • Household chores - cooking; cleaning; washing dishes; laundry; shopping; (in Tanzania only) fetching water; tending livestock; cultivating crops and vegetables. • Health care - reminding parent/relative to take their medication; caring for parent/relative in hospital; assisting with mobility; preparing special nutritional food. • Personal care - washing/ bathing parent/relative; assisting to eat, dress and use the toilet. • Child care - bathing siblings; supervising and accompanying them to/from school. • Income generation activities (in Tanzania only) – begging; casual farm work; selling produce; domestic work; working in a shop. • Emotional and practical support - talking and comforting parent/relative; helping to remember appointments and bills. Children and parents reported negative effects of their caregiving on children’s emotional wellbeing, health, school attendance and academic performance, engagement in leisure and social activities with their peers, relationships with family members and others in the wider community. However, many children also felt they had gained from their caring responsibilities in terms of closer relationships with their parent/relative with HIV, siblings and other family members and felt that they had become more independent, mature and had developed greater emotional resilience and knowledge and understanding about HIV/AIDS. The study identifies the risk and protective factors that influence whether children take on caring roles and the level of their involvement in care work in families affected by HIV/AIDS. A complex range of factors at the different levels of the individual child, household, community, socio-cultural and national policy context and the global policy environment structure the context in which young caregiving takes place. Support networks within the family, school and wider community play a significant role in building children and families’ resilience and mitigating the negative impacts of young caregiving and HIV/AIDS on households. However, in severely affected communities in Tanzania, as in many other African countries, these support networks are overstretched and the capacity of families and communities to support households affected by HIV/AIDS has been seriously diminished. In the UK and other high income countries, families affected by HIV may not have access to extended family networks or social networks in their community due to geographical distance, migration and stigma. NGOs and formal safety nets, however, provide much needed material and emotional resources for children and families affected by HIV/AIDS, although their capacity to meet the specific needs of young carers and parents with HIV is currently very limited. Potential Use in Non-Academic Contexts Messages for policy and practice • There is a need for greater recognition of children’s caring responsibilities in families affected by HIV from the local to the global level, and the development of policies, services and support to meet the specific needs of this group of young carers, within the broader category of children affected by HIV/AIDS/ orphans and vulnerable children. • Key approaches that promote resilience include practical and emotional support for parents with HIV, holistic family approaches, opportunities for short breaks, social activities with other young people in similar situations and the development of life skills. Confidentiality, cultural appropriateness and sensitivity to stigma and diverse, complex needs are paramount to the development of services for children and parents with HIV. • Linked to this is a need for greater awareness and knowledge of HIV/AIDS within families, communities, schools, governmental and civil society organisations and welfare institutions. This would reduce stigma and discrimination, enable children and parents to seek support and help to prevent and alleviate children’s unpaid care work in families affected by HIV/AIDS.

"RES-000-22-0596"	"Nanotechnology and News Production: Scientists', Journalists', and Editors' Views"	"http://researchcatalogue.esrc.ac.uk//grants/RES-000-22-0596/read"	"2004"	"2005"	"Nanotechnology, the manipulation of matter at the level of atoms and molecules, is predicted to become one of the most fiercely debated scientific topics in the years ahead. Expenditure on research and development in nanotechnology has risen dramatically in recent years. In response, the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC), the Institute of Nanotechnology, and the National Science Foundation, urge that social scientific research into communicating nanotechnology issues to the public is given high priority (see Roco and Bainbridge, 2001 2002; BBSRC, 2003). There appears to be growing recognition of the need for social scientists to be more closely involved in helping to promote public awareness of nanotechnology and participation in its eventual regulation (Arnall, 2003; Wood et al. 2003). One area of particular significance is the process of news reporting. In this context, this project aims to advance understanding of the complex factors influencing the communication of news and information about biomedical nanotechnology across the public sphere. Specifically, the project investigates how scientists, journalists, and editors, respectively, view the production of news about biomedical nanotechnology. Which factors do they consider to be significant in the shaping of news coverage? Who do they believe determines what issues are covered, how they are reported, and why? How do they view their communications with one another, as well as with interested stakeholders, as affecting the quality of reporting? To what extent do they seek to influence the portrayal of issues? By exploring these and related questions, this project aims to contribute new insights into the processes underlying news reporting on biomedical nanotechnology issues, to stimulate informed dialogue and deliberation among scientists, journalists, editors and members of the broader community about pertinent forms of science journalism, and to produce useful recommendations for policy and practice.      Recently, nanotechnology has become the focus of increasing media attention and public debate. A growing number of non-governmental organisations have identified nanotechnology as a key campaign area, following on from earlier campaigns about genetic modification (Kaplinsky, 2003). Most prominent of these is the Action Group on Erosion, Technology and Concentration (ETC), who have switched their major focus from agri-biotechnology to nanotechnology. They argue that this new technology has potentially horrendous social and environmental risks (ETC, 2003). It is a also a key campaign issue for Greenpeace, who held a New Scientist/Greenpeace debate held at the Royal Institution in May 2002 (http://www.newscientist.com/hottopics/sciencedebates/article.jsp?debate=3), as well as Friends of the Earth (Burke, 2003). Environmental groups warn that nanotechnology is likely to follow the same route as the row over GM food if there is a lack of dialogue with the public, and could result in a series of crises in political and media arenas (Arnall, 2003; Greenpeace, 2002; Knight and Pierce, 2003). This is supported by the conclusions of the ESRC (1999) Global Environmental Change Programme Special Briefing Report and, more recently, by the conclusions of an ESRC report on the challenges of nanotechnology (Wood et al. 2003). Clearly, understanding the factors affecting communication of information about nanotechnology is crucial to understanding the formation of public views about this technology. Like other areas of biotechnology, nanotechnology is the subject of dystopian visions as well as utopian dreams about its potential medical benefits. Scientists are increasingly aware of the importance of how they communicate their work to the public for public trust in science (Durant and Lindsey, 2000; Schultz, 2002; Wolfendale report, 1995). Ian Gibson, chair of the House of Commons Science and Technology committee, maintains that scientists need to think carefully about how to engage with the media and convey to the public the true essence of their work. We have to learn from the lessons of the GM debate where, all too quickly, the real issues became obscured in a fog of panic and confusion (Gibson, 2003). Recognising the potential of the news media to influence public views, a growing number of scholars have undertaken studies of the content of biotechnology news. Unfortunately, little attention has been paid to the less visible processes of news production that shape what gets reported, how and why. This project will address a number of unanswered questions about source-media relations, thereby filling a gap in understanding of the factors affecting how information about nanotechnology is communicated to the public. A literature review and survey of research databases indicates that there is no UK published research on this topic. It will therefore provide a substantial foundation for further interdisciplinary work "	"81"	"Anderson, Alison"	"-1"
"RES-000-22-0601"	"Participation in River Basin Planning: The Case of the Ribble Pilot"	"http://researchcatalogue.esrc.ac.uk//grants/RES-000-22-0601/read"	"2004"	"2004"	"CONTEXT The Water Framework Directive (WFD) is seen as the largest and most significant piece of European Union (EU) environmental policy and represents a major overhaul of EU water law. The overall aim of the WFD is the long-term protection of all surface water and ground water. In every River Basin District (RBD) the principal mechanism for achieving this aim will be detailed in a River Basin Management Plan (RBMP). The EU WFD, in adopting broader United Nations environmental conventions, requires a wide range of local stakeholders to be consulted over RBMP policy proposals. The UK Government, environmental Non-Governmental Organisations and independent researchers have independently acknowledged that there is a lack of research examining the nature and configuration of stakeholder involvement in RBMPs. In response to these concerns the Department of Environment Food and Rural Affairs has recently announced that it will run a pilot RBMP on the River Ribble with a specific focus on stakeholder involvement to be overseen by Waters Northwest. The purpose of this being to detail approaches to stakeholder participation that meet the core requirements of the WFD including access to information, formal consultation and active involvement. The launch of the WFD Ribble Pilot, therefore, offers a particularly opportune moment to begin to examine and understand the nature of stakeholder engagement in RBMPs. AIM The proposed research aims to examine the role of stakeholders in River Basin Management Plan policies and proposals and to recommend measures to improve practice. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY After a thorough review of relevant research and guidance documents, a briefing paper will be prepared to generate external interest in the aims and objectives of the research. This briefing paper will provide an overview of the project and will be published on the website of the Centre for Urban and Regional Ecology, School of Planning and Landscape and will also be submitted for publication in the professional environmental management journal Town and Country Planning Stakeholders in the WFD Ribble Pilot will be sent a questionnaire to collect information on the nature of stakeholder involvement in the Pilot process. The information collected will not only be used to inform detailed follow-up interviews but will also form the basis of a workshop to be held approximately four months after the commencement of the research. This workshop will publicise the draft results of the analysis of the completed questionnaires and will provide an overview of the state of current practice of stakeholder involvement, and links between stakeholders, in the WFD Ribble Pilot River Basin project. Copies of all documentation relating to stakeholder engagement in the Ribble Pilot will be collected and analysed according to the research questions. Together these will be used to draw up detailed interview schedules that will be used to structure face to face interviews with principle contacts from each stakeholder group. All information will be collated and entered on to interview summary sheets for analysis. Each research question will be addressed by means of an analysis table which will contain factual material and opinions collected during the research. The research will yield a set of stakeholder summary sheets summarising the data collected with completed analysis tables containing both factual information and opinions for each research question, together with further notes and documents. These tables will present both quantitative and qualitative information relating to each research question. In the process of this question-by-question analysis, the various research objectives will be met. DISSEMINATION OF RESULTS It is intended to disseminate the findings of the research through the end-of-grant report and the publication of at least two papers in academic journals and one in a professional journal. In addition, two workshops will be organised which will be attended by stakeholders and other participants in the RBMP process. The first will provide an overview of current stakeholder practices. The purpose of the second workshop will be to present and discuss the results of the research and to debate current stakeholder engagement within the Ribble Pilot River Basin in the context of compliance with the WFD "	"81"	"Howe, Joseph"	"-1"

It matters especially now because new technologies are producing new dynamics between past and present, and determining relationships between individuals and communities. The primary aim of the proposed seminar series is to encourage dialogue between different disciplinary approaches in order to promote further enquiry into the uses of nostalgia in contemporary culture. We will draw on perspectives from marketing, consumer research, literary studies, history, media and cultural studies, and we aim to stimulate interchange with those working in heritage industries, publishing and commercial marketing.  The seminars will establish an international network of academics. The themes of the six seminars are: retro and material culture, which will address trends towards retro design and consumption print and media, which explores  nostalgic trends in publishing, and perspectives on nostalgia in film, art and the media urban nostalgia, which examines the construction of Glasgow's identity through heritage marketing, architecture and cultural/sporting events diaspora and virtual communities, which focuses on nostalgic evocations of the homeland, and the impact of new technologies on diasporic communities sustainability, which analyses the nostalgic desire for authenticity; and a PhD and early career colloquium.                           "	"81"	"Edwards, Sarah"	"-1"

Most attention focused on the immediate aftermath. Little thought went into long-term rebuilding of lives and livelihoods, creating sustainable communities or fully engaging local people in decisions taken. The Durham University Project Sri Lanka Institutional Model (Durham Model) and International Association of Schools of Social Work (IASSW) Rebuilding Peoples' Lives After Disasters Network associated with social work's community-based empowerment model (IASSW Model) aimed to counteract these weaknesses by providing ground-breaking work in the processes of internationalization in the context of globalisation and a humanitarian impulse to help from a social justice value base. In examining these two models, this research follows an interpretive ethnographic approach that uses a range of quantitative and qualitative methods including mapping disaster interventions; participant observations; and narrative interviews. The findings will attract considerable interest, not least because the Durham Model has a proven track record of success as evidenced by HEFCE and British Council recognition, and because the UN and IASSW are interested in the anticipated transferable skills, paradigm shifts in professional practice and curricula developments that are expected to arise from the findings.   "	"81"	"Dominelli, Lena"	"-1"

The most severe of these floods derive from North Sea storm surges, when wind and tide combine to drive huge quantities of water against the coast, as happened to devastating effect in 1953. This project seeks to understand the occurrence of storm flooding in the past, and to explore the ways in which people have responded to the threat.   The project will draw upon rich surviving documentary sources to study the impact of storm flooding upon the reclaimed marshlands bordering the tidal Thames and its estuary during the period c.1250-1550. Year-by-year accounts of the management of riverside properties will be examined and the degree to which reclaimed land was lost to the sea during the later Middle Ages assessed. The impact of population decline and agrarian recession upon the economics of coastal and river-side defence will be considered. The flood threat to medieval London’s low-lying suburbs will be investigated and the possibility that the long-term flooding of lands down-river spared the city the worst effects of North Sea storm surges explored.  Parallels will be sought in the modern policy of managed retreat or realignment.

We compiled a list of 118 interventions to benefit wildlife on agricultural land, then reviewed and synthesized evidence for each intervention. Fifty-four people farmland conservation practitioners scored how important each intervention is for farmland conservation, and answered more questions about a subset of interventions, using an online survey. Ten experts in agricultural ecology, policy or rural social science evaluated the evidence. They assessed how much is known about each intervention (% certainty) and whether the evidence showed a benefit to wildlife. The evaluation process used iterative scoring rounds. We combined expert evaluation of the evidence with consultation of conservation practitioners and policymakers, to identify ten research priorities in important areas where evidence is weak or incomplete, and ten advocacy priorities in important areas where evidence of benefit is strong. The results showed practitioners had high awareness of the range of farmland interventions and good knowledge of the amount of scientific evidence that exists about them. However, practitioners generally had less good understanding of the results of research. "	"81"	"Sutherland, William"	"-1"
"RES-451-26-0538"	"Changing Parenting Culture"	"http://researchcatalogue.esrc.ac.uk//grants/RES-451-26-0538/read"	"2008"	"2010"	"The seminar series Changing Parenting Culture comprised five events that took place over 2009 and 2010. The five subject areas covered were: ‘From child-rearing to ‘parenting’: what’s new about contemporary parenting culture?’; ‘Gender and parenting culture: Intensive fatherhood?’; ‘Child-rearing in a risk society’; ‘Changing Parenting Culture: the problems of parenting policy’; and ‘Pregnancy and pregnancy planning in the new parenting culture’. The overall aim of the series was to explore the way that the cultural meaning of ‘parenting’ has expanded and how it has become an object of expertise and policymaking. Through a series of conversations we hoped to discuss the history and sociology of this development, and its effects for parents’ experience and for the workings of specific child-rearing related activities. The series was a great success. The events brought together in a very powerful way detailed study of particular aspects of the contemporary experience of parenting including TV parenting programmes, feeding babies, family planning, and outdoor play, with a wider socio-cultural analysis of the history and contemporary features of parenting culture. Overall the series attracted a diverse group of people, stretching beyond academic colleagues, as research users of a variety of kinds participated as panellists and attended events. As this was a seminar series, there are no findings as such. However, the comments below indicate how the discussions were perceived by colleagues who attended, in provoking new thoughts and ideas:  Seminar 1 ‘This has been an extremely valuable two days. Well worth attending. The presentations have varied but have all fitted into the overarching aim of this first seminar. It has been useful to be part of an interdisciplinary discussion of research with a common theme. Too often research does get pigeon-holed. Personally, it has really provided me with ‘food for thought’ and a whole range of issues to reflect upon. I look forward to the forthcoming seminars which I would certainly be keen to attend. Thank you.’ ‘Rare to have this quality of focus of discussion at a seminar. Excellent!’ Seminar 2 ‘Really enjoyed the day and being able to lose myself in hearing such interesting and contemporary debates and ideas (and to remind myself/think through how my own work fits into these) Excellent.’ ‘The emphasis on current government policy and rhetoric was really very valuable’. Seminar 3 ‘I think that these series of seminars have been very thoughtful, have built upon each other and have created a really substantial intervention in this area’. ‘We should have more seminar series like this one!’ ‘Overall the quality of this seminar programme is excellent, the development of the arguments across the sessions and programmes is exactly what should occur in the ESRC seminar series programme’. Seminar 4 ‘ Very thought-provoking and intellectually stimulating sessions! Particularly attractive for students due to free of charge. Access and contemporary discussions!’ ‘An excellent series of discussions, which ended in a fantastic venue. Raised so many interesting questions – some of which were answered, some weren’t, but leaves plenty of scope to take these topics further’. ‘This has been an absolutely fantastic seminar series – it would be great if you could continue’. Seminar 5 ‘A fantastic program with wonderful speakers. Very well organised event – thanks to the funders and organisers for bringing the U.S speakers over!’ ‘As a convenor of a parenting organisation, I think this whole series has certainly informed the deliberation of the public on this issue – it has been very relevant to what parents are thinking and would like to understand more of’ ‘This was a fantastic conference, interesting speakers and an audience interested in stimulating new ideas around the issues. As a whole the series was fantastic and has made a great difference to my work. It is a great shame it has now come to an end.’ We also did press work through the series, and the coverage draws attention to some of issues raised: http://www.parentingculturestudies.org/seminar-series/press.html The observation made most frequently by those who attended the seminars drew attention to their coherence. The concept parenting culture remained the central focus throughout. It was the quality of the programmes – the development of ideas through individual seminars and across the series – that stood out most of all. Scholars from many disciplines presented at/attended events and the value of this inter-disciplinarity was remarked upon through the series, as participants commented on feeling a genuine sense of intellectual excitement and stimulation resulting from the discussion. Early career stage colleagues were involved throughout; more than 10 doctoral students / early career stage appeared on panels over the series. On this basis, the most likely future impact will arise through further consolidation of a new research agenda developed through the series, related to which will be new research and dissemination of ideas about the problems of contemporary parenting culture. The following are comments from non-academics who attended, indicated what they thought was useful about the evnets: ‘For me, attending the first Changing Parenting Culture series was like being hit by a thunderbolt. Suddenly so many of the issues that I'd been considering as a journalist suddenly came in to focus. The research and discussions that occur at the series cut through the buzz of popular notions about parenting and unearth deeper and more philosophical issues related to children and parents. The series helps quantify and examine issues that otherwise remain on the periphery. I've found it an essential critical tool in my coverage and comment about parenting for the Times. Long may it continue.’ Jennifer Howze, The Times ‘As Information Officer at One Plus One the seminar series was a very useful opportunity to consider current academic thought on the changing parenting culture. I was able to cement some really fruitful links with other attendees as well as disseminate information about One Plus One and the services we provide, particularly in terms of our research and information resources available. I also got lots of details of new references, resources, articles and books to add to our library collection, keeping it fully up to date. The series was timely, relevant, interesting and a very useful information gathering opportunity. Thank you!’ Laura Dimmock, One Plus One [With reference to Seminar 5] ‘The conference was of particular benefit to service providers in that it provided a more ‘nuanced’ and sophisticated analysis of how women think about pregnancy planning, and decision-makings than is usual. Speakers highlighted the way in which women and their partners might accrue benefit as well as risk to non-use of contraception. This has potential impact on the way that strategies to reduce the number of unplanned and unwanted pregnancies are framed. The discussion on methodology regarding qualitative research – specifically regarding the way women reporting unplanned planned pregnancies ‘tell their stories’ will be valuable to those looking to analyse feedback from service users, which is increasingly required as a part of Quality Audit. The discussion on the nature of ‘stigma’ was also valuable to those needing to understand the self-image and self-concerns of service users.’ Ann Furedi, bpas Education, Healthcare, Other"	"81"	"Lee, Ellie"	"-1"

Approaches towards youth justice/welfare diverged significantly after the 1968 Social Work (Scotland) Act, with the introduction of children's hearings in Scotland by 1971 and the retention of juvenile courts in England. The project asks whether working relationships between practitioners were differently negotiated within the two regions in the years before this juncture. As well as looking at papers collated nationally, the exercise of local discretion is researched microscopically through two local case studies: of Manchester, England, and Dundee, Scotland. The case studies involve the construction of two databases of sample juvenile court appearances, surveys of the local press, and the collection of other archival materials relating to policing and social work. Profiles of patterns relating to young people's offending behaviour in these two cities are compared in terms of gender, age, types of offending behaviour, place and space. The project also analyses the operation of Juvenile Liaison Schemes and other cautioning schemes in terms of multi-agency response. "	"81"	"Jackson, Louise"	"-1"

It examines the day-to-day operations of the state veterinary field department and assesses local responses to these interventions. This entails a detailed unpacking of the historiographically neglected interface between African farmers and state veterinarians. Using the 1930s as a starting point enables the capturing of several generations of African voices through oral testimonies, facilitating an analysis of continuity and change over time.  The project explores questions of medical hybridisation and the evolution of pluralistic local veterinary knowledges by looking at the impact of western biomedical science on stockowners conceptualisation of disease, treatment of animals and management of the environment. It also considers how African empirical observations about livestock diseases and healing have contributed to the expansion of veterinary research in South Africa. The project includes a national overview of the role of the state in disease control, supported by two case studies, one in KwaZulu-Natal, the other in the North West Province, to bring depth and detail to the analysis of responses and interactions.

"ES.J010588.1"	"KNOWLEDGE EXCHANGE, SPATIAL ANALYSIS AND HEALTHY URBAN ENVIRONMENTS: INTEGRATING WALKABILITY MODELS INTO PRACTICE"	"http://researchcatalogue.esrc.ac.uk//grants/ES.J010588.1/read"	"2012"	"2013"	"The Knowledge Exchange, Spatial Analysis and Healthy Urban Environment (KESUE) project has extended previous work from a project that examined the health impacts of a regeenration schemes in Belfast (the Physical Activity in the Regenerationof Conswater, PARC project)  in order to develop evidence and policy tools that link features of the built environment with physical activity in the cities of Belfast and Derry-Londonderry in Northern Ireland. It has used this data to help shape policy decisions in areas such as physical activity, park management, public transport and planning.    Working with a range of local partners who part-funded the project (City Councils in Belfast and Derry-Londonderry, Public Health Agency, Belfast Healthy Cities and Department of Regional Development), this project has mapped all the footpaths in the two cities (covering 37 per cent of the NI population) and employed this to develop evidence used in strategies related to healthy urban planning. Using Geographic Information Systems (GIS), the footpath network has been used as a basis for a wide range of policy-relevant analyses including pedestrian accessibility to public facilities, site options for new infrastructure and assessing how vulnerable groups can access services such as pharmacies. Key outputs have been Accessibility Atlases and maps showing how walkability of the built environment varies across the two cities. In addition to generating this useful data, the project included intense engagement with potential users of the research, which has led to its continued uptake in a number of policies and strategies, creating a virtuous circle of research, implementation and feedback. The project has proved so valuable to Belfast City Council that they have now taken on one of the researchers as a full-time employee.   "	"81"	"Ellis, Geraint"	"-1"
"RES-061-25-0473"	"Trickling Up? A study of eco/social enterprises in Southern and Eastern Africa and their role in sustainable development at the base of the pyramid"	"http://researchcatalogue.esrc.ac.uk//grants/RES-061-25-0473/read"	"2011"	"2013"	"In 2001 Kofi Annan stated that 'trade not aid' is the long-term route out of poverty for Africa. This research project identifies examples of social and environmental enterprises in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and East African Community (EAC), to explore and evaluate the role that these enterprises may play as a mechanism to 'trickle up' social, environmental and economic benefits from within local communities. A directory will be developed of examples of social or environmental enterprises that produce, retail, manufacture or offer services within the SADC and EAC countries, as well as the donor agencies, voluntary associations and assurance schemes that support these. Using a mixed methodology combining archival data analysis, surveys, and interviews the study will analyse the examples with the Directory, followed by in-depth qualitative case study research on 9-12 social and/or environmental enterprises from within Kenya, Mozambique, South Africa, and Zambia. This study will consider the interaction of these enterprises with their local and global supply chains, explore the role of donor funding and industry associations, and evaluate the specific role that such enterprises may play in poverty alleviation and sustainable development within communities typically considered to be in the economic 'base of the pyramid'.

"ES.I009604.2"	"Developing a social wellbeing approach for sustainable fisheries in South Asia"	"http://researchcatalogue.esrc.ac.uk//grants/ES.I009604.2/read"	"2012"	"2014"	"Amidst a global fisheries crisis there is growing tension between the need to conserve dwindling fish-stocks through conservation management, and the needs of men, women and children who depend upon access to fish and marine resources for their wellbeing. The premise of this project is that fisheries policy can be hindered by inadequate understanding of the impacts of declining fisheries, and the policy response, on locally affected people. This knowledge gap can lead to policy conflict, especially in poorer countries where fisheries-dependency can be high, and capacity to adapt may be limited. This project aims to both advance conceptual understanding of how the concept of social wellbeing can be used to address fisheries-conservation conflict, and to generate empirical evidence on the ways in which such conflict affects the wellbeing of fishers and their families. The project will adapt a recently developed wellbeing framework and methodology and apply it to two conflicted sites in Sri Lanka and India. Empirical data will be collected on the relationship between marine resources, current governance arrangements, and the capacity of fishers and their families to pursue their wellbeing. It will deliver three policy workshops in partnership with local institutions to disseminate findings. "	"81"	"Coulthard, Sarah"	"-1"
