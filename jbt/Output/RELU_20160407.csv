Using evidence from historical records, archaeology and environmental data, changes in the upland landscapes of the Peak District and Sutherland over the past 500 years are traced. Upland areas of this kind continue to be under pressure from agriculture, climate change, tourism and other demands. Tracing historic changes can give a longer-term perspective to help understand the processes at work and to ensure that the upland ecosystem and rural communities are better able to adapt to future change."

To this end, it will: (1) produce a review paper examining the role of the rural cultural landscape – both as ‘container’ and ‘network’ – as a nexus of social, economic, natural and built ‘capital’; (2) elaborate a conceptual and practical model in which landscape is seen as a framework for area-based rural governance, rural data management, policy delivery and stakeholder participation; (3) suggest how this model might be tested by future, inter-disciplinary research; (4) conclude with a seminar/workshop in which the nature and implications of an integrative landscape model can be debated and disseminated. In so doing, it will explore landscape units as settings for a virtuous circle in which rural economic recovery, healthy lifestyles, sustainable environmental services and place-distinctiveness are mutually reinforcing; and it will broach impending major policy issues, such as the re-casting of protected areas as sustainability ‘greenprints’, and regeneration of rural economies through valorisation of local identity."

This integrative approach has the potential to be of considerable value in informing policy in rural areas over the next 10-20 years.
