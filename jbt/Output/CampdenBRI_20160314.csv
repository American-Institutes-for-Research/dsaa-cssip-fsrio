"131999"	"Food allergens &dash; providing guidance for compliance and resolving analytical challenges"	"2014"	"2016"	"The publication of food allergen reference doses and the resultant ability to calculate action levels to aid decisions on the need to apply precautionary (""may contain"") labelling to food products is an eagerly anticipated development in food allergen management. Although guidance states that food businesses should not rely solely on results of allergen testing to make this decision, analysis remains an integral part of allergen management. It is important therefore that food businesses have confidence in the results of allergen tests. This project will provide information to engender confidence in analytical results to aid with decisions based on food allergen action levels. In addition, in 2014 the food information regulation will supersede current allergen labelling legislation. One of the fundamental changes is the introduction of the requirement to provide information on the allergen content of foods sold loose and in catering situations. This project will also support catering establishments by providing guidance and training on management of food allergens.

"132496"	"Bakery products for non-coeliac gluten-sensitive consumers"	"2014"	"2017"	"The aim of the study is to produce a much more palatable alternative to gluten-free (GF) bread for gluten-sensitive people. Gluten sensitivity is distinct from coeliac disease and is estimated to affect a sizeable proportion of the overall population (6-10%); it represents a significant market opportunity both at home and overseas. Because certain wheat proteins are more important in creating the texture of bread, while others are believed to be linked to gluten sensitivity, it is speculated that wheat bread can be made to be suitable for those sensitive to gluten by the removal of certain proteins from wheat using novel approaches. Bread made from wheat is expected to be more comparable to standard bread and to be preferable to GF bread. This work will be developed through a joint programme involving Warburtons and DSM, using approaches based on advanced enzyme technology, ingredient formulation and bakery processing in order to achieve the selective removal of wheat protein types. The Rowett Institute is a further member of the consortium and will seek to work with gluten sensitive volunteers to establish whether treatments are beneficial and desirable to them.

"134933"	"Development of a risk model to determine an appropriate level of due diligence testing for raw material and final product authenticity"	"2015"	"2016"	"Risk Assessment is widely used by the food industry. Although it may work well for microbiological hazards, many sectors of the food industry do not understand the concept of risk in relation to other hazards such as chemical hazards or allergen management. In addition to requirements to perform risk assessment defined by industry and legislative standards, it could be a useful tool to help companies develop testing schedules as part of their quality assurance schemes. Analytical testing of products or raw materials is an expensive part of a company's QA scheme. The requirement to include checks for raw material and product authenticity has become important. A systematic approach using a risk model could be used to estimate the amount of testing required based on knowledge gleaned from food safety management, TACCP, horizon scanning or gap analysis exercises. This project will review risk assessment practices used by other industries, and use this knowledge to produce a new Guideline document or update Guideline 65 (""Risk Assessment and Management of Raw Materials"").Guideline documentation will include suitable guidance for companies to allow them to develop testing schemes based on HACCP, TACCP, horizon scanning, gap analysis or legislative requirements.
