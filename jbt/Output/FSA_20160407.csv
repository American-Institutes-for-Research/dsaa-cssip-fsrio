"FS231020 (T01060)"	"A double blind placebo controlled parallel trial of soy isoflavones on markers of bone turnover in females in early menopause"	"http://www.food.gov.uk/science/research/foodcomponentsresearch/t01programme/t01projlist/t01060"	"2010"	"2014"	"Two hundred women within two years of the onset of the menopause will be recruited and randomised. Each participant will consume a snack bar containing 7.5g of isolated soy protein powder (Solcon F) with 33mg of isoflavones (given twice daily) or 7.5g of the isolated soy (extracted, isoflavone free) protein alone (given twice daily) as control. The bars will be provided to the participants in a box containing the number of soya bars required for the twelve weeks of treatment, plus 10 bars marked as reserves. The boxes and bars will only be identified by the randomisation number; neither the researchers nor participants will know if they have been allocated the active bar or the placebo until after completion of the study. Each participant will attend clinic four times. Participants will have their height, weight, waist measurement and blood pressure recorded during each visit and will provide fasting blood samples on the second, third and fourth visit. At the start and end of the study participants will also complete a flushing frequency questionnaire, which will be used to assess patient-reported hot flushes. Blood samples will be frozen and stored for batch analysis of serum isoflavones, with bone turnover assessed by measuring serum carboxyl-terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen (CTX), a marker for bone resorption, and serum amino-terminal propeptide of type 1 collagen (P1NP), a marker for bone formation. To ensure the snack bars have measurable activity, markers of efficacy such as insulin resistance & cholesterol will also be collected for all participants."	"It is currently unclear whether the consumption of dietary phytoestrogens, such as isoflavones commonly found in soy, have positive or negative implications for human health overall. The safety of soy in women in the early menopause, when bone loss is greatest, is unknown. Previous studies have reported the consumption of soy as having a small positive effect on bone mineral density. However, it has been suggested that studies in this area have potential flaws in terms of the soy preparation used, the placebo used, the study population chosen and the bone measurement method employed. This project aims to determine whether soy isoflavones have an effect on markers of bone turnover in menopausal women and aims to be able to quantify the magnitude of that effect. It will enable the Agency to better assess the risks and benefits associated with the consumption of dietary phytoestrogens enabling appropriate advice to be provided to consumers."

Two hundred and fifty patients with borderline or subclinical (without symptoms) hypogonadism will be recruited and given either a soy/isoflavone or soy/placebo containing product twice daily for three months. Each patient will provide two fasting blood samples which will be frozen and stored for batch analysis. Testosterone levels will be measured using tandem mass spectrometry and a breast ultrasound will be performed to see if there is any increase in the glandular component of the male breast during soy supplementation over the three month period."	"It is unclear if soy is affecting serum testosterone levels in men and there is concern over falling sperm counts in men, particularly those whose testosterone levels are already compromised. In 2003 The Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COT) noted that “Reports of hormonal effects in men from dietary soy or isoflavone supplementation are inconsistent, showing no or weak hormonal effects”. This proposal seeks to determine if soy protein containing the phytoestrogen isoflavone, given in daily divided doses, has any effect on testosterone levels in men who have borderline or subclinical (without symptoms) hypogonadism. This research will confirm whether soy may be clinically relevant in men with compromised gonadal function."

Each site recruited about 1500 pregnant women (3,000 in total). It was estimated that about 300 (10%) of the women will deliver low birth weight babies. Caffeine consumption during pregnancy was determined by measuring caffeine and its metabolites in urine and saliva, in conjunction with information from a specially designed caffeine assessment questionnaire and diet recalls."	"It has been suggested that higher caffeine intakes may carry an increased risk of both spontaneous miscarriage and low birth weight. However, previous research has been hampered by difficulties in obtaining accurate measurements of caffeine intake and assessment of individual differences in caffeine metabolism. This study is of importance as it links, for the first time, accurate estimates of caffeine intake, interindividual variations in caffeine metabolism and pregnancy outcome. The research should help to reduce uncertainties in the current risk assessment and provide a robust basis for the Agency's advice to pregnant women on caffeine consumption. Unlike much of the previous research into the possible effects of caffeine on reproductive health, this study is prospective. It includes biomarkers of caffeine intake and explores interindividual variations in caffeine metabolism. In addition it considered all sources of caffeine intake, not just tea and coffee."

Samples of blood, liver and adipose tissue are analysed. The secondary outcome will be to determine whether bariatric surgery-induced weight loss causes an increase in tissue concentrations of brominated compounds. The results will allow the risk assessment process for the obese population to be refined. The obese patients undergoing weight loss surgery (gastric band surgery) have been recruited, who will provide tissue samples during surgery. Follow up blood samples are being taken 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after surgery. Each participant will also complete a simple food diary and have their weight loss and change of body composition monitored. Non-obese patients undergoing minor gastric/abdominal surgery are being recruited as controls. Measurement of levels of brominated compounds in liver, adipose tissue and blood samples has been performed using high resolution mass spectrometry. The final data will be analysed to identify the change in brominated compounds levels over time associated with loss of body weight/change in lean body mass, together with the load of brominated chemicals in subcutaneous adipose tissue before and after weight loss."	"Brominated chemicals are used widely and applications include flame retardants in office products (computers, for example), and soft furnishing (upholstery, for example). While some flame retardants are decreasing in use due to restricting regulations, the use of other replacement brominated flame retardants is still increasing. These compounds persist in the environment and several have been added to the list of Stockholm persistent organic pollutants (ie based on the 2001 Stockholm Convention). They persist in human and animal tissue and have been reported to show various biological effects. The results of this study are meant to provide insights on toxicodynamics of the distribution of brominated chemicals in adipose tissue of obese and non-obese patients, characterise burden of contaminants in liver and adipose tissue and relationship with blood levels."

The study recruited fifty individuals who report reactions, including (but not exclusively) headaches and nausea, after consuming aspartame and fifty individuals who normally consume foods containing aspartame without problems acted as controls. Subjects were asked to complete general health and wellbeing questionnaires, they also provided blood and urine samples. The samples were analysed to determine the effect of aspartame consumption on plasma and urinary metabolite profile. The data was assessed to determine the suitability of the product and the methodology in order to determine the feasibility and power required for an effective full scale study."	"A number of individuals reported adverse reactions after consuming food and drink containing aspartame. Whilst numerous research studies and risk assessments have shown aspartame can be consumed safely, individual reports of these reactions persist. Given this continuing anecdotal evidence, European regulatory authorities, including the Food Standards Agency, feel it’s appropriate to see if more can be found out about these alleged effects.

A review of existing approaches for qualitative evaluation of uncertainties in risk assessment was undertaken. The potential suitability of these approaches was evaluated, and the most promising combination of approaches was identified and incorporated into the framework. Forty experts were invited to provide a direct and thorough test of the applicability and usability of the identified framework using one of four case studies, based on previous COT statements. This was achieved as part of a workshop on evaluation and expression of uncertainties in risk assessment, held in conjunction with the COT’s annual out-of-town meeting."	"In 2007 The Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COT) published its report on variability and uncertainty in toxicology.

Gene expression analysis will be undertaken on liver samples from this study in order to assess whether gene expression changes induced by mixture exposures are similar to gene expression changes induced by individual additives. Based on the results of the in vivo studies outlined above, dose levels and parameters will be selected to be employed in in vitro rat and human liver studies, for comparison of in vitro and in vivo results for the rat, and to provide information on potential differences in response between rats and humans. A 28 day dietary administration study was performed in rats, with the four food additives tested individually, and as mixtures of pairs of additives and mixtures of all four additives. Gene expression analysis was undertaken on liver samples to assess whether changes in gene expression induced by mixture exposures were similar to gene expression changes induced by individual additives."

These particular additives were chosen on the basis that the ILSI-Europe Acceptable Daily Intake Task Force had concluded combined actions or interactions might occur between them under experimental conditions. To assess whether there were any interactions the additives were tested individually and in various statistically determined combinations. These projects were a continuation of previous work performed in the FSA funded Project T01021. The aim is to test the additives both individually and in various statistically determined combinations, to assess whether there are any interactions between the chemicals. This project is a continuation of previous work performed in the FSA-funded project T01021 and will be performed in collaboration with project T01041. T01040 will focus on study design, analysis of gene expression and statistical analysis of results. T01041 will focus on conducting studies in rat and human liver cells.

The classical approach to estimate the within-individual and the between-individual components of variation separately is the analysis of variance (ANOVA) method used by Beaton. A more sophisticated procedure by Nusser can manage different types of statistical variability, intake values and between-person intake variability ranges and is able to process an array of distributions within the data. These two models were applied using data from different food groups: those whose consumption is fairly evenly distributed; those where it is slightly skewed; and those where consumption is very skewed. The project also considered whether 4-day food diary data could be used effectively rather than 7-day data."	"When there is a risk of chemical contaminants being found in food, e.g. mycotoxins or pesticide residues, it is important to know how frequently and in what amounts a person might be consuming that food. There is a need to develop a model that can estimate long-term intake from short-term data available, with a view for assessment of when it becomes likely that individuals may consume contaminants to a potentially hazardous level."

Urine samples will be analysed using flow injection 1H NMR spectroscopy coupled to computer based pattern recognition. This should identify biomarkers that can be correlated with the consumption of well cooked meat together with cruciferous vegetables. Ultimately these data should make it possible to identify metabolic pathways modified by cruciferous vegetable intervention."	"There is a strong association between diet and cancer and notably with the consumption of well cooked red meat. Cooking of red meat or fish at high temperatures leads to the formation of heterocyclic amines, which have been found to cause cancer in laboratory animals. The most abundant of these compounds is 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP). Studies have shown that PhIP needs activation by metabolism before it exerts its harmful effects. Cruciferous vegetables (such as Brussels sprouts, cabbage, broccoli) are reported to protect against cancer by modifying the metabolism of carcinogens such as PhIP. Project T01009: Can cruciferous vegetables alter the genotoxicity of heterocyclic amines following human consumption of cooked meat? , set out to test this assumption. This was done by looking for PhIP metabolites found in urine samples collected from human volunteers who had eaten cooked burgers either after a cruciferous vegetable free period or after consuming cruciferous vegetables for 14 days. The project was able to demonstrate that dietary intervention with cruciferous vegetables modified the metabolic handling of PhIP and identified the need for further work. Since T01009 ended in 2002, advances in technology, and notably in metabonomics have made it possible to carry out detailed analysis of biofluids using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectroscopy (MS) combined with sophisticated bioinformatic data analysis. These techniques have made it possible to identify metabolic changes due to disease, homeostasis or the administration of exogenous chemicals."

These will be categorised by their mechanisms of genotoxic activity. Compounds with a potentially thresholded mechanism of action will then be subjected to further investigation. This will generate a priority list of compounds that will be subject to laboratory testing using in vitro models. In addition, experimental work will be carried out on a small number of chemicals that have already been identified as possibly meeting the criteria of acting via a threshold mechanism. Those selected are: bisphenol A, rotenone, fisetin and acrylamide. In addition, the project will include a study of whether exposure of mice to low levels of bisphenol A in vivo leads to an increase in abnormalities of oocyte meiosis leading to aneuploidy."	"Food may contain a number of genotoxic substances, present at very low levels as natural constituents or as a result of unavoidable contamination. Current UK policy is that it is prudent to assume a non-threshold dose response for chemicals that are genotoxic in vivo . The Committee on Mutagenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment recently reviewed its general approach to risk assessment of in vivo mutagens and concluded that for certain substances (such as aneugens) it may be possible to identify potential threshold-related mechanisms of action. These mechanisms include DNA repair activity, compound detoxification and the existence of multiple targets for genotoxin interaction. Mechanistic and dose-response studies may support identification of a critical No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL), to which uncertainty factors could be applied in establishing a Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI)."

The project will examine the toxicity of the chemicals, individually and in combination, over a large dose range that encompasses human-relevant exposure, using in vitro cell-based systems to establish the nature of any biological response. The study will provide a huge number of experimental variables, so a statistical experimental design will be used to rationalise the number of experiments required. One benefit of this approach is the potential to extend the analysis to include further chemicals of interest, as the mathematical basis of the analysis can be adapted to include any number of additional chemicals."

A second review examined the state of knowledge for how assessment factors should be combined in risk assessment. Additionally, two expert elicitation exercises were undertaken: the first to gather expert opinion on low-dose extrapolation for genotoxic carcinogens in general, and the second focusing on four selected examples: aflatoxin B1, benzo[a]pyrene, ethylmethanesulfonate and ethylnitrosourea. A statistical framework was developed for combining assessment factors to account for different sources of uncertainty and variability when interpreting the MOE. A major part of the project examined the relationship between MOEs and human cancers directly, by comparing risk estimates obtained from carcinogenicity data in experimental animals, using the MOE approach, with the measured risk in exposed subjects, obtained from epidemiological studies. The final stage of the project integrated the different lines of considered evidence, to derive overall conclusions on the level of concern associated with an MOE of 10,000. That is, if the BMDL10 value of 170 ng/kg bw/day for aflatoxin B1 was divided by an estimated human exposure value of 0.017 ng aflatoxin B/kg bw/day, the MOE value would be 10,000. p>"	"In the UK and the rest of Europe, the general approach for assessing the risks from genotoxic carcinogens has been to reduce exposure to levels that are ‘as low as reasonably achievable’ (ALARA), because it is not possible to identify an intake without a risk. However, this approach does not provide a clear basis for deciding on the urgency or extent of risk management actions. To assess the risks from genotoxic carcinogens, EU and international scientific committees have been using the margin of exposure (MOE) approach, which compares estimated exposure to a selected benchmark dose lower confidence limit (BMDL). The MOE approach is used in risk assessment to determine the level of risk to those exposed, for substances which are both genotoxic and carcinogenic, and consequently where it is not possible to identify an intake without a risk. The MOE approach assesses the level of concern. The aim of this study was to develop a robust scientific rationale for defining levels of concern associated with given values or ranges of MOE for genotoxic carcinogens. p>"	"Imperial College London - Experimental Medicine and Toxicology, Division of Investigative Science and The Food and Environment Research Agency (FERA)"	"-1"	"65"	"Institution not in the DB; please collect information manually and populate in institution_data table."

Measurement of the induction of CYP1A1 RNA allowed the construction of a concentration-response curve. The concentration-response curve can be used to determine the agonistic potency of the compounds, with antagonism measured by treating the cell lines with TCDD together with differing concentrations of the antagonist. The project extension aimed to investigate partial agonism of the AhR. The potency of three dioxin-like compounds that are often detected as contaminants in food will be assessed. These dioxin-like compounds have been identified as having antagonistic properties and may reduce the agonistic function of TCDD on the AhR. CYP1A1 RNA from rat liver cells (H4-IIE-C3) and human carcinoma cells (MCF-7) will be used to assess the agonistic and antagonistic properties of each contaminant alongside TCDD (utilising the method identified earlier in the project). The potency values, also known as the toxic equivalency factor (TEF), will be calculated using a mathematical model known as a quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) approach. Comparison of the AhR between species (rat and human) will allow for an improved understanding of AhR activation and CYP1A1 induction. The results will enable the Agency to validate and improve the risk assessment process and will provide additional valuable information on the toxicity of the selected contaminants. The results will also provide valuable information on the activation of the AhR and the resulting toxicological responses from exposure to more than one dioxin or dioxin-like compound."	"Dioxins and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are persistent organic pollutants (POPs) that are often detected as contaminants in food. There are many different types of dioxins and PCBs which have different levels of toxic potential, with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) recognised as being the most potent. There are concerns that dietary exposure to dioxins and dioxin-like compounds can lead to reproductive effects, immune deficiency and an increased risk of cancer. The initial aim of the project was to identify knowledge gaps to further refine and reduce uncertainty in the risk assessment of dioxins. Particular emphasis was placed on understanding the underlying toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic factors used in the risk assessment for dioxins. In the course of the project methodology was developed that enabled the measurement of the dissociation constant (the ability of a contaminant to bind to a cellular receptor) for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). The methodology is suitable for use in both rat and human recombinant In Vitro cell lines. The project was extended in 2008 to further investigate how dioxins and dioxin-like compounds interact with the AhR, specifically focusing on how AhR activation may be affected if there is more than one dioxin or dioxin-like compound present and to determine what the effect might be on toxicological potency."

Individually, they will have documented occurrence in food items and available data on their levels in humans. Initially, this project will investigate dose-response relationships for relevant individual chemicals. These chemicals will then be tested in a series of mixtures. Three in vitro assays will be used in this project: The ER-CALUX assay, which detects chemicals that act on the estrogen receptor; the MCF-7 cell proliferation assay, which detects chemicals that stimulate cell division; and the PALM assay, which detects chemicals that act on the androgen receptor. Mixtures will be made up of the chemicals which are active in each respective assay and predictions made as to what joint response will be achieved. Subsequently, the mixtures will be tested experimentally and the observed responses compared to the predictions. The mixtures will also be tested in combination with chemicals that do not induce positive effects in the assays to investigate whether they modify the joint effect of the mixture. Finally, mixtures (with and without modifiers) constructed to reflect levels of chemicals predicted to be found in human tissue will be tested. This will help to determine whether effects of combinations of chemicals are likely to be significant when present at the levels humans are exposed to from foodstuffs. Given the complexity of the proposed mixture studies this work will be carried out in vitro using a 'fixed mixture ratio design' approach (Altenburger et al, Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2000, 19, 2341-2347)."	"Current approaches to risk assessment of mixtures of compounds have limitations and do not address the complexity of mixtures of chemicals that may occur in the diet, many of which are present at very low levels. A considerable body of work exists on mixtures of chemicals with similar modes of action. This has shown that knowledge of the effects of individual chemicals can be used to predict mixture effects accurately using the concept of dose addition. However, there are few data for mixtures of chemicals with diverse modes of action, especially when individual components are present at low levels, that is around the 'no observed effect levels' (NOELs). This project will address this gap, focusing on endocrine disrupting effects (using in vitro tests for estrogenicity and anti-androgenicity) and will aim to develop methods of predicting the effects of mixtures of chemicals with known properties. Specifically, the project aims to address the following points: Are multi-component mixtures of food constituents able to act together to produce significant combination effects when present at levels that may be achieved through dietary intake?

Using a range of treatments this project determines factors that modulate the level of PhIP-DNA adduct formation. PhIP- DNA adducts are formed by incubating the cells in 14 C-labelled PhIP to create DNA adducts. These adducts are detected by Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) a very sensitive technique that can be used for accurate measurement of PhIP-DNA adduct formation in isolated cells. Hydrogen peroxide is used to produce oxidative DNA damage. Protective effects are investigated using the plant chemicals quercetin (found in a wide variety of plants) and sulphorophane (which is particularly abundant in cruciferous vegetables) and the antioxidant vitamin E. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is used to quantify activation of PhIP metabolising enzymes and the metabolic pathways involved in detoxification (the latter in conjunction with enzyme based assays). PhIP-DNA adducts can be repaired by known enzymes. Thus the project also examines the effects of protective dietary compounds on the degree of DNA repair enzyme expression."	"Diet is implicated in the formation of many forms of cancer. During the cooking or frying of meat and fish a group of carcinogenic heterocyclic amine compounds are produced. One of the most commonly occurring heterocyclic amines is 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5- b ]pyridine (PhIP). PhIP is activated by the liver where it can bind to DNA forming potentially harmful PhIP-DNA adducts. Unless removed in a repair process genetic damage caused by such adducts can contribute to the development of cancer. In addition cells are continuously exposed to free radicals generated as a part of cellular metabolism. Though this oxidative DNA damage is routinely repaired as a function of cellular maintenance, it still represents an important factor in generating DNA lesions (i.e. as a source of mutations). There is some evidence to suggest that certain mutagenic compounds may stimulate enzymes involved in DNA repair. This raises the possibility that heterocyclic amine induced DNA damage could lead to enhanced overall DNA repair within the cell. One of the initial aims of this project is to determine whether the heterocyclic amine, PhIP, influences the level of oxidative DNA damage caused by cellular free radicals and what the subsequent consequences for the cell will be. Evidence suggests that a diet that is rich in certain vegetables and fruit, can contain substances that may reduce the risk of some cancers. Thus an additional aim of this project is to explore this hypothesis and to explore the mechanisms involved in possibly reducing the toxicity of PhIP compounds found in the diet."

They are formed as by-products of natural and industrial combustion, and during some industrial processes. They accumulate in fat and fatty tissue of living organisms. The main source of human exposure to dioxins is from the diet; the highest levels being found in fatty foods such as dairy products, meat, and oily fish. Determining human tissue concentrations of dioxins is an important factor for assessing the risk to public health from these compounds, and this information is currently lacking for the UK population. This study aims to determine what happens to dioxins stored in body fat when someone loses a lot of weight over a short period of time. The results should enable the Agency to determine whether the dioxins concentrate in the remaining fat or are lost from the body along with the fat.

Other cellular targets, such as voltage-activated Ca2+ channels, may also be affected. Hence, to define common mechanism groups (CMGs) it is proposed to use intracellular protein profiles, determined by techniques such as surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionisation – time of flight (SELDI-TOF) mass spectrometry, in neuronally-derived cells such as SH-SY5Y. Effects on functional endpoints, such as neurotransmitter transport, would also be assessed. Proteins with changes suggestive of a CMG (e.g. common to structural analogues), would be identified by proteomics using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometryand assessed for biological relevance from the pathways involved. The role of selected proteins in the functional responses of cells would be confirmed by blocking expression using small interference RNA species. The ultimate aim of the project was to identify a small number of functionally important proteins characteristic of each CMG, the number of protein profiles determining the number of CMGs."

The ability of the individual benzimidazoles to induce micronuclei was first investigated using a Chinese hamster ovary cell line. Micronuclei were scored with an automated imaging system using image analysis. Information about their potency was then used to make predictions about their joint effects when present as multi-component mixtures. Separate predictions were made depending on whether they acted in accordance with independent action or concentration addition. A mixture experiment, using seven benzimidazoles with multiple replications, was then performed to test the predictions. The project also investigated mixtures of benzimidazoles together with aneugens which act by dissimilar mechanisms. This was to investigate whether mixtures of aneugens may act according to concentration addition even if the mechanisms are dissimilar. Finally, the project was extended to assess mixtures of benzimidazoles together with some clastogens. Clastogens also cause micronuclei, but by an entirely different mechanism, causing chromosome breaks rather than the loss of whole chromosomes from the nucleus during cell division. Current expectation was that there would be no combination effects between aneugens and clastogens."	"The Committee on Mutagenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COM) recommended research to study the way benzimidazoles work together when present as mixtures to cause a chromosome abnormality (aneuploidy). Benzimidazoles are used as pesticides (fungicides) and veterinary medicines (anthelmintics). Most benzimidazoles are recognised to be aneugens, i.e. substances which can cause changes in the number of copies of chromosomes by affecting the segregation of chromosomes during cell division. Benzimidazoles cause aneuploidy by inhibiting microtubule formation. The COM recommended that combinations of benzimidazoles be tested to investigate whether the benzimidazoles act independently (independent action) or according to the principle of dose/concentration addition. For independent dose or concentration addition, the effects of a mixture are as predicted by adding up the doses or concentrations of the individual substances after adjusting for differences in their individual potencies. A key implication of dose/concentration addition is that combined effects may occur when all mixture components are each present at low doses/concentrations at which they are ineffective on their own. If benzimidazoles are found to: act according to dose/concentration addition, then account needs to be taken of their combined exposures in dietary risk assessments act independently then risk assessments can assess each benzimidazole separately"	"University of London, School of Pharmacy, Centre for Toxicology"	"-1"	"65"	"Institution not in the DB; please collect information manually and populate in institution_data table."

Grow relevant crops and treat with agreed dosage of pesticide suite pre- and post-harvest based on modified good agricultural practice. Determine and compare the quantities of residues (including metabolites where available) in washed and unwashed raw produce and after preparation and processing, using analytical methods validated in objective 1. Statistically evaluate the experimental data. Methodology: Appropriate SOPs for the preparation and processing of the various fruit and vegetables intended for use in this study will be developed for use. A combination of GC-MS and LC-MS instrumental techniques will be used to quantify residue levels in solvent extracts from representative samples of each commodity pre- and post-processing, spiked with pesticides of an appropriate range and concentration, and involving sufficient analytical replication to ensure good recovery and precision of analytical methods. A statistically valid experimental plan (designed in conjunction with Applied Plant Science and Biometrics Division, AFBI) will be followed to ensure a sufficient and timely supply of treated fruit and vegetables that will facilitate sufficient randomisation and replication of samples to detect any statistically significant differences in residue levels between treatments, according to OECD Guideline 508. Following preparation, representative samples will be stored deep-frozen prior to analysis. Analyses will be carried out using the standard analytical methods validated at the beginning of the study. The effects of washing and processing will be evaluated by analysis of variance (ANOVA) using GenStat with Fisher’s protected least significant difference (LSD), in order to detect statistically significant differences in residue levels due to preparation and processing."

To establish a panel of protein markers for TSEs in sheep, a series of blood samples was taken from donor sheep at several time points throughout the course of disease. Biomarkers were established initially in the terminal animals infected with a TSE and then in a time course series. A panel of markers was constructed taking into consideration markers present at the terminal stage and markers which appear at earlier time points thus providing a robust panel which were used to build a mathematical classification model algorithm. Markers were tested and validated in a blind study to assess their sensitivity and specificity."

The labelled PrP Sc -particles are evaluated using Fluorescence Intensity Distribution Analysis (FIDA) which captures fluorescence from the two different antibodies. To enhance sensitivity a prion protein amplification (PPA) method will be used which in combination with surface-FIDA should result in an ultra sensitive detection method for TSE-associated particles. This could aid the detection of low levels of PrP Sc - in the early state of disease and in non-central nervous system tissues or body fluids.

Importantly, it is also known that hosts with mixed infections displaying a single pathology can harbour low levels of a distinct strain which can emerge upon further passage. There are limited studies on mixed infections with BSE and scrapie, however within a mouse model this scenario led to the presentation of a scrapie-associated pathology, even when the inoculum had much greater levels of BSE agent compared to scrapie agent. Together, data suggests that similar mixed infections of sheep or goats may present as scrapie even though the BSE agent is present. An in vitro prion amplification assay will be applied to the detection of very low levels of BSE agent in the presence of an excess of scrapie agent. The contractor has previously demonstrated that this assay is exquisitely sensitive for the BSE agent and does not amplify any scrapie agents. The aim of this study is to establish this novel amplification-assay for the detection of BSE in the presence of scrapie agent and to compare this method with conventional BSE tests applied in routine surveillance. The aim is to provide a novel, high sensitivity assay to monitor for the presence of very low levels of BSE in small ruminants, even with concurrent scrapie infections.

"Prion diseases are fatal brain diseases with no effective treatment.  Until the emergence of BSE in the mid-1980s it was thought that any given prion disease had a very limited natural host range. For example, scrapie affecting sheep/goats and Creutzfeldt Jakob disease (CJD) affecting humans. However, the BSE agent not only affected cattle, but was also the causal agent of feline spongiform encephalopathy and human variant CJD (vCJD), both arising from the consumption of BSE contaminated bovine products. BSE-contaminated bovine-derived meat and bone meal was extensively fed not only to cows, giving rise to the UK cattle BSE epidemic, but also to small ruminants. Yet extensive surveillance has failed to uncover BSE infections in sheep populations throughout Europe, including the UK. This is surprising given that sheep are susceptible to BSE when fed the agent under experimental conditions. Two cases of BSE infections have been identified in goats. The UK small ruminant population has had endemic scrapie and whilst the incidence of this disease has been significantly reduced, it is estimated that approximately 67,000 scrapie infected animals still enter the human food chain each year. One concern is that low levels of BSE cases may be harboured within the small ruminant population and be masked by concurrent scrapie infections."

Infectivity was measured in a mouse line transgenic for the ovine PrP gene containing the VRQ allele. The specific outcome was a measurement of PrPd in tissue that correlates with infectivity in a specific bioassay model. These data were used to calculate measurement of infectious load in edible tissues so as to inform on the likely risk when compared with infectivity in relevant species models."	"A quantitative approach to measure the infectivity levels in edible foods was established in order to underpin a proportionate response for estimating the risk of disease transmission. Establishing infectivity levels in edible tissues and their potential risk is not easily solved as the assumption that misfolded PrP is the sole cause of prion disease is contentious. In addition, the levels of PrPres measured by current diagnostic tests for TSEs do not always correlate with disease."

Groups of orally dosed deer were sacrificed at 6 and 12 months post inoculation and necropsies carried out. A group of deer with BSE injected intra-cerebrally plus a further group of orally dosed deer were maintained until clinical disease or the end of the project. A range of tissue samples were collected at post-mortem and analysed for the presence of signs of TSE disease. All animals were monitored clinically throughout the experiment to define any clinical phenotype."	"The major cause of the spread of the BSE epidemic was attributed to the feeding of contaminated meat and bonemeal (MBM) in the protein rations fed to cattle. The use of MBM in animal feed was not restricted to cattle rations and it is known that MBM was included in the concentrates fed to farmed deer. BSE has been shown to be naturally or experimentally transmissible to a wide range of different ungulate species and deer are known to be susceptible to an endemic TSE (chronic wasting disease, CWD) which is prevalent in North America. However, to date, no TSE infections of UK deer have been reported. Should BSE infection have been transmitted into the UK red deer population, the CWD precedent would suggest that there is potential for both spread and maintenance of the disease in both free living and captive UK deer populations. The purpose of this study is to investigate the susceptibility of UK red deer to BSE infection and to determine the clinical and pathological phenotype."

However the dorsal root ganglia and the vertebral column (VC) from these cattle were designated as SRM and not permitted to enter the food chain. To enable butchery staff to identify carcasses that require VC removal, a simple method of marking the appropriate carcasses was required.

Through monitoring CNS dispersion under research and commercial abattoir conditions, it is anticipated that best practices and critical points in existing procedures can be identified. Protein antigen-based (ELISA) assays will be used to monitor cross-contamination of carcasses, equipment and abattoir environment (including atmospheric) with CNS material during conventional slaughter, dressing and butchery of cattle and sheep, in order to identify critical practices. Based on the results of these studies, changes to conventional methods will be tested under experimental conditions to ascertain whether cross-contamination can be reduced. Concurrently, innovative equipment (particularly saws and vacuum devices) will be developed and tested for their ability to reduce or eliminate cross-contamination. A set of guidelines for avoidance of CNS cross-contamination in the meat industry will be drafted for presentation to the EC."	"The principle sites of infectivity in mammalian species carrying TSEs are in the brain and spinal cord. To reduce the risk of transfer of TSE infectivity from meat to man, these tissues have been excluded from entering the food chain. However, conventional slaughter and butchery practice could enable these tissues to cross-contaminate the meat and meat plant environment. Risks are different in different species, bovine carcasses being conventionally split down the median sagittal plane at the end of dressing, thus exposing the spinal cord, whilst the majority of young sheep carcasses are despatched in entire form from the abattoir, and currently contain the spinal cord. Cross-contamination is important because of the increasing public concern over food safety; and it may be direct, that is between constituent parts of a carcass and its meat, or indirect, that is from a source on one carcass to another via some route involving the environment, operator or implement."

Contamination will be quantified using CNS marker protein(s) and will be measured on head meat after different handling and harvesting methods currently used. The effects of bunging the captive bolt shooting hole and the foramen magnum (including after brain stem sampling) on contamination of heads will be determined. The effects of surface dehydration of heads during storage on the detection and amount of CNS material will be measured. Two options to simulate loading, within-plant/road transport, and unloading of heads being transferred to a cutting plant will be explored. A best practice for the procedures involved in shipping heads will be identified and contamination levels after transfer will be compared with that on heads harvested on-line."	"During the slaughter and dressing of bovines, there are several conventional practices that disrupt the integrity of the central nervous system, (CNS) and have the potential to disseminate it on edible meat. This applies not only to carcass meat, but also to head meat, possibly contaminated by brain material (which is specified risk material) at, or following, stunning an animal with a captive bolt gun. Head removal also is an invasive procedure, as the spinal cord is severed, and there may be leakage of brain tissue through the foramen magnum. There is no information on the prevalence or amount of CNS contamination of head meat from cattle slaughtered in UK abattoirs and therefore no basis for an assessment of public health risk from these sources should a slaughtered animal be infected with BSE. There are many factors that have potential to introduce substantial variability in the degree of contamination of head meat, including abattoir practices and subsequent moving and storage of heads if harvesting meat is performed off-line or in separate premises."

"European Commission Regulation (EC) No 1881/2006 sets maximum levels of certain contaminants, including nitrate, in foodstuffs. It requires member states to monitor nitrate levels in particular green leafy vegetables and report, annually, the results to the Commission. Nitrates commonly occur in high concentrations in spinach and lettuce mainly due to climatic conditions. This is a particular problem for lettuce growers in northern European countries, such as the UK, because poorer light quality can restrict the energy available for assimilation of nitrate by the crops. Consequently, the UK had struggled to meet the lower limits set by the Regulation and was allowed an exemption which ended in December 2008. Recent research and monitoring have demonstrated that climatic conditions, which clearly cannot be controlled, limit the extent to which good agricultural practices can be used to minimise nitrate levels in the UK and other northern member states. Though new increased limits have been agreed since December 2011, continued monitoring is required for possible future review and also to inform policy to manage any potential risk of nitrate in green vegetables."

Humans consuming parts of the contaminated plants, especially cereals or their processed products are therefore not just exposed to the native (free) mycotoxins, but also to conjugated forms. In addition to metabolism, processing of food (eg cooking, baking and brewing) is another potential source of mycotoxin conjugates. When masked mycotoxins enter the intestinal tract, these compounds are likely to release the free, unbound mycotoxins and might add to the toxicological burden Therefore the presence of masked metabolites of mycotoxins in foods and their release inside the human gut need to be assessed to add to a more complete assessment of the risk posed by these compounds."

The detection of semicarbazide in samples of Scottish heather honey from hives which were unlikely to have been treated with nitrofurazone, suggested that semicarbazide may have originated from some other currently unidentified source. Although EFSA's ‘Opinion on Semicarbazide in Food’ concluded that semicarbazide is not a concern for human health at levels found in food, it could adversely affect consumer confidence in this product and severely damage the honey industry."

Simple model systems containing selected food ingredients (sugars, starch, salt, proteins) were set up to facilitate the search for hidden fumonisins. LC/MS/MS was used to detect and quantify the hidden fumonisins. As a first stage, simple solutions of sugars, starch and protein were prepared and the potential for fumonisins to become hydrolysed or bind to these food ingredients was assessed. At the second stage, the model systems mimicked the time, temperature and pressure profiles of food processes. The same conditions were then used in the presence of ingredients during the manufacture of recognisable food products to identify the breakdown and/or binding of fumonisins under these conditions. The presence of hidden fumonisins in retail food products (cornflakes, extruded maize snacks, tortilla chips) was also investigated. An assessment was then undertaken to assess the significance of the hidden fumonisins."	"Fumonisins including FB1, FB2 and FB3 are mycotoxins produced by Fusarium fungi and are most commonly found in maize and therefore in maize based foods. A joint FSA/DEFRA funded project entitled ‘The fate of Fusarium mycotoxins during food processing’, showed that in some processes the levels of parent fumonisins can be reduced and were unable to be detected using normal analytical techniques. The reduction may be because they may bind to the food or undergo a chemical change e.g. become hydrolysed. The aim of this research project was to investigate this apparent loss of parent fumonisins during food processing, to identify their fate and determine the significance in terms of the UK consumers’ exposure to fumonisins. The project investigated the levels of the following three fumonisin categories: Parent fumonisins – the sum of FB1, FB2 and FB3 detected in each sample using normal analytical techniques. Total fumonisins – the sum of parent fumonisins plus hydrolysed fumonisins (HFB1, HFB2, HFB3) and bound fumonisins, which were measured in hydrolysed forms. Hidden fumonisins – the difference between total fumonisins and parent fumonisins (i.e bound and hydrolysed fumonisins)"	"Premier Analytical Services"	"-1"	"65"	"Institution not in the DB; please collect information manually and populate in institution_data table."

This project identified the key factors influencing the production of these mycotoxins with the aim of highlighting quality control/assurance techniques to satisfactorily manage these risk factors within a commercial context and so reduce the risk of mycotoxin contamination to the consumer."	"Mycotoxins are poisonous secondary metabolites produced by certain fungi present in cereal crops. Of current concern to the European cereals industry are the 'field' mycotoxins produced by the genus fusarium (such as deoxynivalenol, fumonisin B1 and zearalenone) and storage mycotoxins, in particular ochratoxin A. The stability of mycotoxins means that they can persist through the food chain and in some cases this includes accumulation in livestock tissue, which is subsequently eaten by the general public. Developing management systems for the control of mycotoxins produced by fusarium is complicated, due to the numerous factors involved in the cereal production process. It was the aim of this project to identify points and risk factors in the commercial flow of grain that are critical to the management of mycotoxin contamination, in order to minimise consumers exposure to mycotoxins."

Different sample clean up methods will be investigated, and analytical parameters optimised to improve sensitivity. The methods will be validated for raw cereals (barley, maize, oats and wheat) and a selection of their products, selected to reflect UK consumption patterns. Methods will be assessed against performance criteria specified by European legislation for mycotoxins."	"T-2 and HT-2 toxins are type-A trichothecene mycotoxins produced by different Fusarium species, including F. sporotrichioides, F. poae and F. acuminatum , that may develop on a variety of cereal grains especially in cold climate regions or during wet storage conditions. Several surveys have revealed the presence of these toxins in wheat, maize, oats, barley, rye, rice, beans, and soybean as well as in some cereal-based products. Current analytical methods are not sensitive enough to accurately assess consumer exposure to these toxins. The aim of this project is to investigate a number of techniques in order to develop more sensitive methods to detect and quantify T2 and HT2 in cereals and cereal products. It is intended that the successfully developed methods can be applied to surveys of cereals and cereal products, in order to aid the assessment of risks to consumers from T2 and HT2.

Owing to the potential for very high levels of ergot alkaloids in mixed grain samples, all naturally contaminated sample analyses were conducted on individual grain types (i.e. wheat or barley or oats or rye). The matrix effects of naturally contaminated raw cereal and processed cereal food samples were investigated. The validation studies revealed the precision, recovery, LOD and LOQ and the measurement uncertainty of the method was also calculated. Due to the lack of appropriate ergot alkaloid reference materials a comparison study was carried out between three laboratories to check for systematic errors and to reveal the comparability of the developed method."	"Ergot alkaloids are mycotoxins produced by the ergot causing fungi of all species of the Claviceps genus, most notably by C. purpurea , and mainly affect cereals and grasses. The fungus replaces the developing grain or seed with an ergot sclerotium. The sclerotia are harvested together with the cereal crop and can thus lead to contamination of cereal based food and feed products. Ergotism was common place in the middle ages and can cause hallucinations and in extreme cases even loss of limbs. Fungal infections are most prevalent in rye and triticale that have open florets but also wheat, sorghum and other small grains can be affected. Ingestion of the ergot alkaloids can cause ergotism in humans and animals. In some severe cases symptoms can include intense pain resulting from vasoconstriction and subsequent gangrene with possible loss of fingers, hands, feet and even entire limbs. Other symptoms can include abdominal pains, vomiting, burning sensations of the skin, insomnia and hallucinations (ergotamine is a precursor of LSD). Ergotism was common place in the middle ages (it was known as ‘St Anthony’s fire’) but has practically been eliminated as a significant human disease in the developed world. It remains an important veterinary problem, particularly in cattle, horses, sheep, pigs and chicken. In the EU no regulatory limits apply to ergot alkaloids in grain or processed products. The EU Scientific Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has reviewed the ergot issue recently (EFSA, 2005). EFSA concluded that the alkaloid concentrations are very variable and a consistent relationship between the amount of sclerotia and the total ergot alkaloid (ergoline) concentration cannot be established. The aim of this project was to develop a validated analytical method covering the major ergot alkaloids found in grains this would enable further research and study of the ergot problem, providing the means for the acquisition of data on the contamination levels of feed and food and characterising ergot toxins. Currently the visible sclerotia themselves are used to determine contamination. In the long term the method is likely to help in the development of a method suitable for use by official control laboratories, should limits be set by the EU Commission."

In this study, a targeted method will be validated for the analysis of cereals and cereal products. As this is a collaborative project, the approach to the analytical method and validation procedure will be common to all four participating laboratories.  This was agreed at the initial meeting with EFSA.    As far as possible samples will be analysed by LC-MS/MS without clean-up. A carbon-13 labelled internal standard will be used to compensate for matrix effects. The method will be validated in each laboratory to an agreed protocol. Samples will be obtained by each partner according the schedule agreed with the EFSA project officer. Fera will analyse 200 samples, these will be a mixture of bulk cereal grains (100 in total) and cereal products (100 in total). If not already homogenised prior to receipt, samples will be milled and mixed using either a dry mixing method or a wet slurry technique as agreed with the project partners and known to be appropriate to ensure homogeneity.  Sample stability will be ensured by storing samples in a freezer after analysis, and after homogenisation if the wet slurry method has been used. Where results need confirmation on account of uncertainty or an unexpected result they can be reanalysed by LC-MS/MS. Quality control procedures will follow JCOP. An in-house reference material containing sterigmatocystin at a level of approximately 1.5µg/kg will be prepared by project partner University of Cattolica and will be included in all analytical batches by all partners.  In addition, an exchange of analytical standards will take place among partners before any survey samples are analysed, to ensure comparability between laboratories. Data will be submitted to EFSA via the EFSA Generic Standard Data Reporting format. Fera will submit a brief report to FSA that gives an overview of the results in relation to method performance and international regulations. A copy of the final report for the whole project will be available once it has been agreed with the EFSA project officer."	"The presence of sterigmatocystin in food (especially cereals) has been reported previously. However, the number of studies carried out to date have been  limited and were partly conducted in the 1970s – 1980s with less sophisticated techniques and relatively high limits of detection (LODs - often in the range 20-50µg/kg).  In 2013 EFSA published an opinion on the toxicity of sterigmatocystin. They concluded that there was a lack of available data which meant that it was not possible to carry out a full risk characterisation for sterigmatocystin. The EFSA CONTAM panel therefore recommended that more data should be collected and that it would be preferable if a method with a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 1.5µg/kg or lower was used for food samples. At around the same time EFSA also published a call for tender for a project to address this issue by carrying out a survey for sterigmatocystin in 1,000 samples from at least 3 different member states.

To develop a test procedure for visible set off. Develop suitable (non-dietary) exposure techniques and analytical methods to enable identification and quantification of ink/varnish components; in collaboration with industry produce reels of packaged printing with inks/varnishes of known composition and quantify the extent of set off. Measure the extent of migration of selected components into food; and use the results of the above to develop a rapid screening method for set off."	"Set off is defined as: ‘the unintentional transfer of substances used in printing inks from the printed (outer) surface of materials and articles intended for food packaging to the inner food contact surface. As a result of the finding of 2-Isopropylthioxanthone (ITX) in drinks packaged in multi-layer cartons, most likely as a result of set off, ink suppliers are now introducing polymeric photoinitiators (used in printing inks to speed up the drying process of the ink using ultra violet light) and synergists (which take part in the reaction involving the photoinitiator) as partial or complete replacements for monomeric photoinitiators and synergists. There is very little published data on the extent of transfer of these new compounds to food contact surfaces via set off and their subsequent migration into food. The aim of this project was firstly to further develop screening test procedures capable of measuring the extent of visible set off (which can be seen by the naked eye) of these replacements and other ink components to the food contact surface of packaging. Secondly exposure techniques and analytical methods to quantify individual ink components on the food contact surface of packaging were developed to allow the measurement of non-visible set off. Finally the migration of ink components was measured in a variety of foodstuffs from specially prepared test films. The project will enable laboratories to identify printing ink components on unused food packaging, estimate worst case migration and thereby assist in the prevention of packaging transferring components to foods at undesirable levels"	"Pira International"	"-1"	"65"	"Institution not in the DB; please collect information manually and populate in institution_data table."

In summary, there were eight research work packages, which are organised in three linked groups: The Chemicals group (four work packages: flavourings, additives, packaging materials and concentrations). This group had as its focus, the target chemicals as outlined in the call. Each sought to determine a list of target chemicals in their given area to ascertain relevant concentration data. These data were gathered independent of the group responsible for collecting occurrence data since both were different. The Foods group (three work packages: food intake, chemical occurrence and regional consumption modelling). This group operated together for several parts of their work package and formed a link with other member states. The food intake grouplinked with the chemicals group to agree definitions of food groups and intakes of such defined food groups and worked with the database group to create suitable database architecture for food intake data. This group worked closely with the Regional Modelling Group to create the necessary input into the regional models. The Database and Modelling groups (exposure modelling work package). Databases were constructed which will show connectivity between intake, occurrence and concentration for each chemical. These databases will exist in tiers corresponding to the complexity of the data.

"The original concept behind FACET was the creation of a food chemical exposure surveillance system, sustainable beyond the life of the project to meet the needs of EU regulatory authorities in the protection of consumer health. At the outset, there were a number of bottlenecks in exposure assessment. These included access to national food consumption databases, difficulty with food categorization, limited knowledge on food chemical occurrence, lack of data on food chemical concentration and on packaging substances. FACET was designed to address all of these issues with regard to the specific concerns of flavourings, food additives and food contact materials.

Once these chemical substances were identified and methods for their analysis developed, then materials, articles or packed food, could be tested for these substances. This test aimed to verify that the recycling process had been properly carried out and in effect would be a post-market ‘challenge test’. The aim wasto help determine whether consumers are adequately protected from substances which may end up in the materials, articles or packed food. A review of published and unpublished (where available) information on the chemical compounds that represent first use conditions for recycled polyethylene (PET), and paper and board were carried out. Analytical methods were then established for the identification and quantification of selected marker compounds. The selected marker compounds were then analysed in recycled PET plastic, and paper and board materials and products. Migration experiments were then carried-out on a limited number of PET, and paper and board products in a range of food simulants. The purpose of these experiments were to verify the methods of analysis developed earlier in the work and measure for the presence of the marker compounds in samples of recycled PET, and paper and board. Food simulants were used in the laboratory to provide a conservative estimate of the amount of individual substances that may migrate from packaging into food."	"There is increasing pressure on businesses and consumers to recycle waste materials. There is also increasing pressure to use recycled materials in place of virgin materials or as a percentage component in a mixed virgin/recycled end product. Reflecting the interest in recycled packaging, EU legislation has been introduced on recycled plastic materials and articles intended to come into contact with foods. Although 'challenge tests' exist to ensure that a product is of an appropriate standard if manufactured correctly, enforcement is by means of factory visits in the country of production to ensure that the authorisation criteria are being met. In addition, while there is no specific legislation covering paper and board, these materials must meet the general requirements of the Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004. Test methods should be in place to ensure that consumers are protected from contamination from poorly recycled food contact materials.

The colourants were obtained from a number of different sources and countries of origin and screened, using solvent extraction, for the presence of impurities and potential migrants. The solvent extracts were analysed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) procedures. Following this initial screening, 7 colourants were selected for further investigations and suitable colourant/additive/plastic combinations were prepared for migration testing. In total, 15 different plastic/additive/colourant blends were prepared. For each plastic there were 2 blends each with a different additive. The plastics used in the testing were high density polyethylene (HDPE), low density polyethylene (LDPE), polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Additives were slip agents, antistats or colourant carriers (used in PET only). A third blend of plastic and colourant with no additive was also prepared to act as a control sample. In all cases the colourants and additives were incorporated into the plastic at their highest level to give the worst case values. Test conditions were selected to represent the most severe conditions that the plastic would encounter in practice. In some cases, to give as much information as possible, more than 1 colourant was blended into a sample. Migration from the samples was measured both on receipt and after storage for approximately 3 months."	"The aim of this project was to systematically investigate the effect of several common additives on the migration of colourants and associated substances. In particular, where applicable, the effect of slip agents and anti-stats that are designed to ‘bloom’ to the surface of plastics was investigated. This was a follow-on project building on work undertaken in the Food Standards Agency Project A03045, which reported on the migration of colourants and colourant impurities into food simulants. However, in order to avoid over complicating the analyses and to allow colourant related migrants to be readily identified, one variable that was deliberately not investigated in project A03045 was the effect of additives such as slip agents and anti-static. In the process of ‘blooming’ it is possible that the additives may also exaggerate the migration of other substances present, including those originating from colourants."

Active packaging is intended to change the condition of the packed food, to extend shelf-life or improve sensory properties while maintaining the freshness and the quality of the food. To do this, the packaging should absorb food-related chemicals or it should release substances such as preservatives, antioxidants, flavourings or colours. For intelligent packaging, the food is intended to influence the packaging so that the packaging gives information about the current condition of the food and/or its storage history."

"T07040"	"Chronic and acute effects of artificial colours and preservatives on children's behaviour"	"http://www.food.gov.uk/science/research/chemical-safety-research/additives-research/t07040"	"2004"	"2007"	"The project was divided into two stages, each involving double blind placebo controlled food challenges (DBPCFC). Stage one investigated the chronic effects of AFCPs on behaviour, acute affects were investigated in stage two. Stage one: chronic effects of AFCPs Stage one involved a sample of 120 three-year old children and 120 eight/nine-year olds selected to represent the full range of ADHD symptoms. Two AFCP mixtures were used. Mix A was identical to that used in the previous study (i.e. 20mg in total of sunset yellow, tartrazine, carmoisine and ponceau 4R in equal amounts plus 45mg of sodium benzoate). A second mixture that is more typical of the AFCPs currently found in children’s foods (mix B) was also developed. Mix B contained quinoline yellow, sunset yellow, carmoisine, allura red and sodium benzoate in amounts representative of the average daily intake of these additives by young children in the UK. With the exception of sodium benzoate, these were the most frequently found additives in recent Agency surveys of children’s sweets and soft drinks, which together are responsible for a major part of the intake of food additives in the diets of children. Sodium benzoate was included as this additive is also widely used in soft drinks currently sold to children, frequently in combination with some of the above colours. Also, the inclusion of sodium benzoate made Mix B more comparable to Mix A. It is important to note that neither of the challenge drinks equates to any drinks that might be commercially available, as they will be used as vehicles via which to administer the total daily dose of additives. The active and placebo drinks were provided as daily doses, delivered at irregular intervals and presented in identical, sealed bottles and with the same appearance. The drink used as the basis for both test drinks and the placebo was a mixture of natural fruit juices. The design of the DBPCFC used in stage 1 of this project is represented in Figure 1. The challenge followed the format of that previously used with pre-school children but with the addition of a second active challenge mix (mix B) and the consumption of the placebo drink during the initial withdrawal period and the washout periods i.e. the child received a drink of some kind throughout. This latter modification removed any unblinded placebo effects influencing parental reports during the withdrawal period. Over a six-week period the children were assessed at baseline (T1). From here onwards the children received continuously for the next 6 weeks either the placebo or the test drink. They were then assessed at T2 before a period of either active (mix A or mix B) or placebo challenge (W2), at T3 before a wash out period of one week (W3), at T4 before the second placebo or active challenge period (W4), at 5 before the second washout period (W5), at T6 and T7 before and after the final placebo or active challenge period (W6). During the challenge periods, each child received either mix A, mix B or placebo drinks for one week. All children consumed all three drinks over the duration of the study. Throughout the study, other sources of AFCPs were removed from the children's diet and the parents were asked to keep a diary of dietary violations during the course of the DBPCFC. Figure 1: Design of the double blind placebo controlled food challenge Assessment was carried out in the children’s pre-school or school and included a daily observation by a research assistant using validated methods. A standardised measure of attention was also used to assess the older group. In addition, ratings of the children’s behaviour were made by parents and by teachers throughout the six-week study period. The parents and all members of the study team were blind, apart from the study administrator. Several factors that may moderate responses to AFCPs were investigated. Firstly, the effect of the children’s pre-trial level of ADHD behaviour was investigated by stratifying the group on the basis of initial ADHD status (measured at T1). The inclusion of the older children also allowed any age-specific effects of AFCPs to be explored. Furthermore, cheek cells provided by all of the children involved in stage one were genotyped in order to determine whether allelic variation in genes implicated in ADHD (e.g. DAT1, DRD4) influenced the effects of AFCPs. Stage two: acute effect of AFCPs Stage two investigated the acute effects of AFCPs in responders and non-responders selected from the older group in stage one. Each child was assessed during two half-day sessions a week apart. At each visit the child was given either a placebo or active drink similar to those used in stage one. However, the amount of AFCPs in mix A and mix B was equivalent to the total daily dose used in stage one but administered in one ingestion. Behaviour and psychological factors were assessed under carefully controlled laboratory conditions at multiple timepoints over a three hour period. Metabolic factors that could mediate a response to AFCPs was investigated by assaying salivary samples for levels of tryptase and by testing urine samples for histamine. Overall, the questions to be addressed by the project were as follows: Do children respond to the withdrawal and introduction of AFCPs in their diets? Is any effect found with pre-school children also found in older children? Is any response seen in teacher ratings, direct observations of behaviour and test performance as well as in parent ratings? Is any response to AFCPs related to initial levels of ADHD i.e. is the response greater in children at the extreme end of the continuum? Do genetic differences moderate any effect? What are the metabolic and psychological mediators of any effect?"	"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common neurological conditions found in children. There has been a longstanding suggestion that some artificial food colourings and preservatives (AFCPs) may affect children's behaviour, particularly in relation to ADHD. This project will build upon a previous study commissioned by the Government that examined the effects of AFCPs on the behaviour of a cohort of three-year old children. Although that study found that AFCPs may affect children’s behaviour, the results were considered inconclusive as the effects were only observed by parents and were not confirmed independently by clinicians. A further limitation of the earlier study design was the observed 'placebo effect'. A large proportion of children in the first study were unaffected (or, in some cases, showed an improvement in behaviour) when on the additives mix, but showed worsening when on the placebo. The present study addresses these limitations and includes further experimental design improvements by taking into account guidance from the Food Additives and Behaviour in Children (FABIC) working group and the Committee on the Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COT)."

The key elements to the study were as follows: An experimental design providing uncertainties for all determined values. Accurate and precise method of measurement (HPLC – high performance liquid chromatography method). Measurement of sulphite rate of loss for each set of storage or preparation conditions. Variants of each product were included to permit the potential correlation of product characteristics with rate of loss. Four types of food were chosen for study: sausages, burgers, diluting squashes and instant mashed potato. There are concerns that sulphite is being consumed at levels close to the ADI. This is particularly important for children whose food intake to body weight ratio is higher. Therefore the food types were chosen because they have high sulphite content and are commonly consumed in large amounts by children. A number of examples of each type were studied. Sausages and burgers were cooked by either grilling and frying."	"Sulphites (E220-228) are used as preservatives in foods, primarily to control microbial spoilage. In solutions, sulphites also exist in the form of sulphur dioxide and are typically both measured and expressed as sulphur dioxide. Sulphites are known potentially to be allergens in people prone to asthma and as such are controlled by EU labelling requirements (Nov 2004). They must be declared if present at or above 10 mg/kg or litre. An acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 0.7 mg/kg body weight/day has been set by the European Scientific Committee on Food (SCF).

In this project, the antioxidants will be extracted from foods by several methods including steam distillation and the extracts analysed by an established technique such as IUPAC 2.642. The best method will be optimised for each food type and the final protocol validated by collaborative trial. In addition to the use of traditional wet chemistry techniques for the extraction of antioxidants from foods, the project aims to trial the novel technique of developing molecular imprinted polymers (MIPS) against some of the antioxidants under consideration."	"Antioxidants are permitted in a limited range of foods, and at well-defined levels as laid down by the Miscellaneous Food Additives Regulations 1995 (as amended).

Antioxidants are added to foods to prevent deterioration of the food by atmospheric oxidation. This is particularly important in oils and fats, and in foods containing oils and fats, to prevent rancidity developing on storage.

Samples of locally grown fruit and vegetable produce were sampled in South West England and analysed to determine the levels of arsenic, cadmium, lead, copper and zinc. In two, geologically stable, arsenic enriched regions of South West England, 630 basket products from local farm shops, greengrocers, pick your own, supermarkets and farmers markets and 174 samples of field produce and associated soil samples were collected and analysed to determine the levels of arsenic, cadmium, lead, copper and zinc.

In the early stages of weaning, the infant diet is made up entirely or largely of breast milk and/or commercial formula, and when solids are given, a large proportion may be commercially available infant foods. Infants' energy requirements and food consumption are on average higher relative to their body weight than that of adults and older children. This means that infants can have relatively higher dietary exposures to chemicals present in food than other age groups, when expressed on a body weight basis.

"FS516009"	"Monitoring the presence of ergot alkaloids in cereals"	"http://www.food.gov.uk/science/research/chemical-safety-research/env-cont/fs516009"	"2014"	"2014"	"In June 2012, following a request from the European Commission, EFSA’s Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM Panel) delivered a scientific opinion on the risks to human and animal health related to the presence of ergot alkaloids in food and feed. The panel’s recommendations included that ‘collection of analytical data on occurrence of ergot alkaloids in relevant food and feed commodities should continue.’ This research is in response to this recommendation. Discussions on managing the risks associated with the presence of ergot alkaloids in food and feed are taking place at the European Commission and currently negotiations are ongoing. Data generated from this work will be used to feed into those negotiations. Current controls put in place by millers and grain processors include processes such as physical separation and cleaning through visual inspection, and separation using optical sorters to remove discoloured and mis-shapened grains. This also removes the sclerotia. The industry has almost a zero tolerance for presence of ergot sclerotia in grains such as wheat, oat and barley – this means any visible sclerotia on inspection will lead to the entire lot being rejected. Removal of the sclerotia results in a considerable reduction in the levels of ergot alkaloids in the grain. However, it is not possible to detect the presence of dust and smaller particles resulting from breakage of the sclerotia and therefore ergot alkaloids could be present. There are six main ergot alkaloids and corresponding epimers (12 in total) and the profile and concentration of individual alkaloids varies considerably in different grains and batches of grain. The toxicity of the individual alkaloids also varies. This study looked at the ergot alkaloid content of grains (wheat, barley, oats and rye) from the 2013 harvest, in approximately 209 samples. The effectiveness of reducing ergot alkaloid content from contaminated samples by removing sclerotia by visual and automated means was also studied in a small number of these samples."	"Ergot alkaloids are mycotoxins produced by fungi of the Claviceps genus; the most notable in Europe being Claviceps purpurea which parasitise the seed heads of living plants at the time of flowering. These fungal infections are most prevalent in rye, triticale that have open florets. Wheat and other small grains are also potential hosts. The fungus replaces the developing grain or seed with the alkaloid-containing wintering body that is known as ergot, ergot body or sclerotium. The sclerotia are harvested together with the cereals or grass and this process can lead to contamination of cereal-based food and feed products with ergot alkaloids. The ingestion of these alkaloids can cause ergotism in humans and animals. The main ergot alkaloids produced by the Claviceps species that are contained in the sclerotia are ergometrine, ergotamine, ergosine, ergocristine, ergocryptine, ergocornine and their corresponding ‘-inine’ epimers."

The 138 categories are then further pooled into 28 food groups. Sample preparation Each individual sample is firstly prepared for consumption (where required) based on information from the UK’s National Diet and Nutrition Survey and manufacturer’s preparation and cooking instructions. Equal quantities of the 24 individual samples in each category are then combined to form the category sample. The 138 categories are then further pooled into 28 food groups. The relative proportion of the different categories within a group reflects its importance in the average UK household diet. This is based on three previous years of food purchase data from the Family Food Survey (previously the National Food Survey). For instance, for the milk group, more semi-skimmed/skimmed milk is included than whole milk as it makes a larger contribution to the average diet.

Perchlorate occurs naturally in the environment, in deposits of nitrate and potash, and can be formed in the atmosphere and precipitate into soil and groundwater. It also occurs as an environmental contaminant arising from the use of nitrate fertilizers and from the manufacture, use and disposal of ammonium perchlorate used in rocket propellants, explosives, fireworks, flares and air-bag inflators and in other industrial processes. Perchlorate can also be formed during the degradation of sodium hypochlorite used to disinfect water resulting in perchlorate contaminating the water supply. The perchlorate ion (ClO4 -) is very stable in water, and its salts are highly soluble.

"Acrylamide (AA) levels in biscuits can vary widely and amounts above 1000 µg/kg have been reported in some products. Free Asparagine (Asn) is believed to be the limiting or dominant precursor of AA formation in cereal products and therefore recipes that utilise cereals which are naturally high in Asn, such as rye, oats and wholemeal flours, may form more AA. Conversely, reducing or consuming Asn, eg by the addition of either an enzyme or yeast, or another microorganism to product recipes, can have a significant impact on the AA level generated during baking.

"Recent studies have demonstrated that 3-APA is a transient intermediate in acrylamide (AA) formation from thermally induced Asparagine / carbohydrate systems. Furthermore, it may also be formed during the storage of foods by an enzymatic decarboxylation of Asparagine, and this mechanism may account for its occurrence in ware potatoes. The occurrence of 3-APA in foods is of concern because laboratory studies have shown that it can generate high levels AA (compared to Asn) when heated. Therefore, foods that contain 3-APA and are subjected to additional thermal processing might be considered as an additional source of AA."

The project is mainly funded by the National Environmental Research Council and the Chinese Academy of Science. The funding contribution from the Agency will allow timely access to results and the opportunity to comment on the scientific approach."	"Brominated flame retardants (BFRs) are present in a wide range of products and materials including soft furnishings, building materials and electrical and electronic goods. A large number of scientific papers have been published on the migration of BFRs into the indoor environment in living rooms, bedrooms, schoolrooms and offices, and the consequent human (and domestic pet) exposure through inhalation and ingestion. However, there has been no similar work in domestic kitchens. BFRs are incorporated into large and small plastic kitchen appliances (dishwashers, fridges, food processors, toasters, kettles etc.), often in quite high quantities. Various textiles used in kitchens (curtains and blinds, chair coverings) will also contain BFRs, and generally it is not unusual for TVs and laptops to be used in kitchens. All of these are potential BFR sources and BFR-containing dust could settle on exposed food or be transferred to food during handling and preparation."

The project uses expertise of two of the foremost laboratories in this field – RIKILT, which has extensive experience of about a decade of using bio-analytical methods such as CALUX, and Fera, which is at the leading edge of emerging contaminant research and is the National Reference Laboratory for dioxins. The project will draw on expertise from both organisations to understand the differences that sometimes arise between methodologies with different scientific approaches. About 100 food samples will be measured for total dioxin-like activity, in duplicate, using established CALUX (and/or other bioassay techniques), in a range of samples considered likely to contain the highest levels of contamination with respect to these compounds (eg fish liver, oily fish, sheep, bovine and porcine liver and carcass meat, brown crab meat, duck eggs). Known dioxin-like compounds will be measured, and they will be quantified and compared with the total activity found from the bioassay measurements. Samples for which there is significant unaccounted activity will be further investigated to detect and identify the compounds responsible. The outcome of the study, including the methodology used and discussion of the findings, will be published in a peer-reviewed journal."	"Bioassay methods for measuring dioxins, based on aryl hydrocarbon (Ah) receptor-binding, have been available for some time. However, there have been reports that high results, for example in soil samples collected near waste sites, cannot be fully explained by the presence of chlorinated dioxins, furans and biphenyls. These are well characterised and have been widely measured and reported in food but there is increasing knowledge of brominated and mixed halogenated dioxins and biphenyls, as well as other classes of compounds, known or predicted to possess dioxin-like activity, for example polychlorinated naphthalenes and halogenated PAHs. In the Committee of Toxicity’s (COT) December 2006 opinion on the revised World Health Organization toxicity equivalent factors (WHO-TEFs) for chlorinated dibenzodioxins/furans and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), the COT referred to the need to investigate other dioxin-like chemicals."

Each sample collected consisted of packs/loose quantities of the same product to give a total of 1.5kg/ litre for each sample. Documentation for each sample provided a clear audit trail that was verified by relevant details recorded on an Excel spreadsheet. Relevant sample information has been transferred to an EFSA formatted database. Premier Analytical Services analysed 400 samples for citrinin (100 samples), alternaria toxins (100 samples), fumonisins (100 samples), sterigmatocystin (100 samples) and ergot alkaloids (100 samples) depending on the likelihood of contamination. Any samples with mycotoxins above the agreed action limit were reported within 1 working day of the initial result by telephone or e-mail, giving full details of the sample and result. The initial result was confirmed subsequently by further analysis and reported in full to the FSA by e-mail once the result had been confirmed. The data collected from the survey was submitted to EFSA as part of their continuous call for data on mycotoxins. The data was also placed into an FSIS Food Safety Information sheet which can be found at the bottom of this page. This provides valuable evidence when negotiating new MLs at Commission working group meetings."	"Mycotoxins are naturally-occurring chemicals produced by certain fungi. Some of these mycotoxins have been associated with a variety of adverse human health effects, and are regulated within the European Union to minimise consumer exposure through food. Mycotoxins can occur in a wide range of foods, including cereals, nuts, spices, fruit, coffee, milk and alcoholic beverages, and at any stage throughout the food chain. The Food Standards Agency commissioned a four-year rolling surveillance programme to quantify a number of mycotoxins in a variety of foods. The aims of this surveillance programme were: To protect consumer safety; To assess the effectiveness of current legislation and Codes of Practice; To facilitate informed negotiations in Brussels and at other international meetings on both current and proposed policy; To enable consumer exposure assessments to be made; To identify emerging areas of concern, for example identification of mycotoxins for which there is limited occurrence data or foods not previously recognised as commodities affected by mycotoxins."

"http://www.food.gov.uk/science/research/chemical-safety-research/env-cont/fs102009b"	"2014"	"2016"	"Representative batches of waste materials including biosolids, waste wood shavings, PSA, PLA and meat and bonemeal ash (MBMA) will be analysed and selected for inclusion in the study on the basis of their chemical characteristics. Dairy cows will be investigated because monitoring contaminant levels in milk from cows in mid-lactation will provide a relatively rapid and sensitive method for detecting and assessing the transfer of contaminants to livestock from ingested waste materials. Research has shown that concentrations of POPs such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in milk can reach steady state within two to three weeks in response to dietary exposure, whereas it takes much longer for these contaminants to reach steady state in body fat. Monitoring milk also has the advantage that samples can be taken at multiple time points in an individual animal, unlike meat samples. The dairy module will be carried out under highly controlled conditions using housed cattle fed specially prepared diets containing either: bedding materials, to simulate incidental ingestion of bedding; or waste-derived soil conditioners (eg PSA, PLA, MBMA, biosolids and/or biocompost) to mimic realistic rates of incidental ingestion of soil from waste-amended pasture. For each exposure scenario, groups of four cows will be fed the specially prepared diets for three weeks and matched groups of control cows will be fed diets without added waste materials. Milk samples will be monitored prior to dietary exposure, during exposure and four weeks after exposure ceases to determine how contaminant concentrations in milk vary during and after dietary exposure for each scenario. Carrots represent a worst-case for potential uptake of POPs from waste-amended soil. Carrots grown under controlled experimental conditions in sandy loam amended with waste-derived soil conditioners will be used to examine uptake of organic contaminants. The potential uptake of selected organic contaminants into cereal plants grown in waste-amended soil will initially be screened under laboratory conditions using a controlled 5-leaf-stage barley bioassay. Any organic contaminants from waste that are found to transfer to the barley shoots will then be investigated further for crop transfer to wheat grain in a replicated field trial on plots of sandy loam amended with the selected waste materials."	"There is pressure to use suitable recycled waste materials in agriculture either as animal bedding, or as soil conditioner. This has the benefit of minimising the use of virgin materials for bedding and of efficiently recycling increasingly scarce plant nutrients by using waste materials such as sewage sludge (biosolids) or poultry litter ash (PLA) as fertilisers. Paper sludge ash (PSA) is an effective desiccant in bedding for cattle. It is also used as a liming agent on land. However, the various waste streams currently used in agriculture can contain a range of chemical contaminants, including various emerging persistent organic pollutants (POPs). This project aims to generate robust scientific evidence that the following will not compromise food safety: rearing dairy cattle on bedding made from recycled waste using waste-derived fertiliser or liming agent for grassland or for arable land used for root crops or cereals The project also aims to identify or validate control measures needed to protect the food chain."

A total diet study has several objectives: to verify that controls introduced since the previous total diet study have been effective and determine the need for further tightening (eg dioxins and PCBs, PAHs); to establish trends and levels of current exposure for contaminants for which the European Commission may wish to introduce limits (PBDEs, HBCDDs, PFAS); and to establish a baseline for newly emerging contaminants for which knowledge of dietary exposure is unknown (polychlorinated naphthalenes, mixed halogenated dioxins)."	"Total diet studies have not been carried out since 2000 for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and 2001 for dioxins/ furans, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).

The experimental approach used for the two main strands of work was the same as that used in the previous research. The impact of flooding on contaminant levels in milk or in meat and offal was assessed by comparing contaminant levels in these food products (and in soil and grass samples) from matched pairs of flood-prone and non-flooding control dairy or beef farms. The previous research demonstrated increased levels of dioxins and PCBs in milk from flood-prone farms near rivers containing contaminated sediment. The current study assessed the impact of flooding on dioxin, PCB and Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE) levels in meat and offal from beef cattle and sheep along the River Trent and the Aire/Ouse river system. These rivers have urban and industrial catchments. In 2008, further monitoring was carried out for dioxins and PCBs in milk and environmental samples from selected flood-prone farms along the River Trent, where milk was shown, in 1998/99, to contain elevated levels of dioxins and PCBs compared with their matched controls. Since the previous study, trends in dioxin and PCB levels in milk, soil and grass have been examined. PBDE levels in the milk and environmental samples were also monitored for the current study. Seasonal variation in levels of dioxins, PCBs and PBDEs were investigated. This was done by periodically monitoring levels of these contaminants in milk, soil, grass, silage, feed and bedding at one selected flood-prone farm and one non-flooding farm along the River Trent. Results were interpreted using conventional statistical analysis. However, due to the relatively small number of farms investigated, a ‘weights of evidence approach’, based on Bradford Hill’s causation criteria methodology (i.e. establishing minimal conditions necessary to provide adequate evidence of a causal relationship between an incidence and a consequence), was also used to provide a more holistic interpretation."	"Previous research (FSA project C01037: Study of the effects of flooding on concentrations of PCDD/Fs and PCBs in milk from cattle grazing on affected pastureland) showed that milk from flood-prone farms along the River Trent and the Doe Lea/Rother/Don river system generally contained higher levels of dioxins and polychlrorinated biphenyls (PCBs) than milk from matched control farms. This was attributable to elevated levels of these contaminants in soil and herbage on flood-prone pastureland caused by sediment deposited during repeated flooding events. However, the effects of flooding on dioxin and PCB levels in meat or offal from grazing livestock were not investigated. The European Union recognised that levels of dioxins and PCBs in food products originating from flood-prone regions could be affected as a consequence of flooding, and recommended monitoring the levels of these contaminants in foodstuffs from flood-prone regions. Increased river-flooding associated with climate change could result in contaminated sediment deposition onto pasture becoming a more significant source of contamination of the terrestrial food chain."

All of the samples will be tested for 28 PAHs including the 16 identified by EFSA as suspected human carcinogens and a possible concern for health if present in food. The results will be used to determine the extent to which there is a problem linked to frying bananas or other fruits in coconut oil. If levels are consistently high, there may be a need to establish risk-based regulatory limits to ensure a consistent approach to enforcement. If there is a significant variation in levels, indicating that low PAH levels are achievable, interim controls may be proposed while the cause(s) of differences are investigated and processes optimised."	"Over recent years there have been several European Union border rejections of banana chips due to high PAHs (based on risk assessment as the product is not currently regulated). Some commercially produced banana chips are prepared by frying in coconut oil, which is itself a raised risk for PAHs and is regulated. The levels of PAHs found in the banana chips are not consistent with the use of compliant coconut oil and it is possible that the high PAH levels are a characteristic of the production process. This is a limited investigation to assess the extent of any possible problem with a view to raising the issue with the Commission and possibly proposing the addition of banana chips to the regulated food categories.

Cambridge University Hospital NHS Trust is the coordinating centre for the study. Peanut allergic individuals will be recruited from clinical centres located in Cambridge (Addenbrooke's Hospital) and London (Royal Brompton and St Mary’s Hospital). One-hundred adults with a diagnosed peanut allergy will be recruited to undergo a total of four food (peanut) challenges at 12 week intervals – a baseline peanut double-blind placebo controlled food challenge, followed by three further challenges in a random order, comprising one repeat baseline challenge, and two further challenges with different extrinsic factors thought to have a possible influence on the thresholds and/or severity of reaction. The extrinsic factors under investigation will be exercise and stress (via sleep restriction). After drop-outs, it is anticipated that complete data for all four challenges will be available for 72 subjects. This will ensure that the study has a sufficient level of statistical power for the primary data analyses. Each clinical centre will perform both baseline and interventional challenges, and both extrinsic factors will be investigated at each centre to ensure diversity of sampling. Pilot work will determine the feasibility of studying extrinsic factors using healthy volunteers to study exercise and sleep restriction. The primary measurement for each participant will be the amount of peanut that causes an allergic reaction during each challenge. This is known as the participant’s baseline challenge threshold (mg peanut protein) and will be recorded for all four challenges. The data will be used primarily to model the variability of challenge thresholds over time within individuals, as a result of repeat challenges, and to examine how the extrinsic factors shift the dose response curve. The University of Manchester will manufacture and distribute standardised peanut challenge meals to each clinical centre. They will also develop an online e-database adapted from the Allerge-e-lab concept that will provide a secure environment for real-time in-clinic collection of patient data (i.e. clinical history, test results, challenge outcomes) The e-database will also facilitate retrospective analysis with relevant EuroPrevall data sets, in particular the further development and application of a numeric severity score. The University of Cambridge (Centre for Applied Medical Statistics) will undertake the main and final analysis."	"It is known there is significant intra-individual variation in the severity of food allergic reactions following exposure to the same amount of allergen on different occasions. This is thought to be, in part, the result of the influence of certain extrinsic factors such as alcohol, exercise, asthma and stress. It is understood that these and/or other factors may increase the sensitivity of allergic individuals to a set amount of food to which they are allergic, resulting in more severe reactions. Alternatively, these factors may influence the lowest dose that an individual may react to. Little is known about the scale or mechanism of these factors which makes it difficult to take them into account when undertaking risk assessments of food allergens. There is therefore a need to better understand the effect of these factors on the severity and threshold dose of reactions (i.e. the highest level of an allergen that does not cause a reaction in the food allergic population), in order to ensure that risk assessments of food allergens are accurate and meaningful. This study will help to inform work the Agency is undertaking to develop management threshold levels (or ‘action levels’) for the unintentional presence of allergens in food to inform labelling and risk management/communication decisions."

Samples were tested for the unintentional presence and quantity of one or more of the following four major food allergens: milk, gluten, peanut and hazelnut. These allergens were chosen due to the large number of incidents the FSA received over the past few years and because of their importance to public health. The survey examined the different types of advisory statements used on pre-packed foods and compared the use of these phrases to the levels of allergens present. It was anticipated this may help to establish whether the use of certain advisory statements are linked to the level of allergen present and indicate whether different types of statements convey different levels of risk to the consumer. In addition, the survey examined whether the suggested advisory labelling statements set out in the FSA’s Best Practice Guidance were being used by industry."	"The current regulatory framework within the European Union mandates the declaration of 14 allergens as constituent ingredients (i.e. peanuts, nuts, soybeans, mustard, eggs, lupin, milk, fish, cereals containing gluten, sesame, celery, sulphur dioxide, molluscs and crustaceans) in pre-packed foods. This legislation does not cover unintentional cross-contamination with allergens or the resultant use of advisory labelling. The FSA introduced ‘best practice’ guidance on managing food allergens in 2006 to assist the food industry in the use of advisory labelling. However, due to the lack of standardisation in allergen risk assessment methodology and inconsistencies in allergen management practices, the application of advisory labelling varies in the way it is presented to consumers. These variations have led some allergic consumers to believe that different types of advisory statements convey different levels of risk (i.e. ‘made in a factory that also handles X allergen’, versus ‘made on a line that also handles X’ allergen). It was anticipated that the results of this survey will help to inform the development of proportionate risk based allergen management thresholds (known as action levels). It was envisaged that action levels will be used by the food industry as well as by regulatory and enforcement bodies to inform decisions about allergen management, and enable the appropriate use of allergen advisory statements, such as ‘not suitable for those with X allergy’ on pre-packed foods. Furthermore, it was anticipated that action levels will help food businesses make evidence-based decisions on the use of factual statements about whether or not a food is suitable for consumption by someone with a food allergy."

Data were identified using pre-defined literature searching databases and reference lists of retrieved articles. Data from articles was extracted and various statistical analyses applied to see if it was possible to determine a statistically robust threshold level of gluten that coeliacs can tolerate."	"Coeliac disease is a life-long autoimmune disease caused by intolerance to gluten, a protein found predominantly in wheat, barley and rye cereals. Consumption of gluten causes damage to the gut lining, resulting in a wide range of symptoms such as bloating, diarrhoea, and nausea, as well as longer term health consequences if the disease is not managed. Management involves a strict gluten-free diet. There has been much scientific uncertainty about what residual level of gluten in the diet is safe for those with coeliac disease, and there is currently no European or UK legislation defining “gluten-free”. A draft Codex Standard developed in 1983, proposed a limit of 200 mg/kg of gluten in foods made from gluten-containing cereals that have been treated to reduce their gluten content and 20mg/kg for naturally gluten-free foods, and more recently there has been a proposal to reduce these thresholds to 100mg/kg for the former category and 20mg/kg for the latter. But this Standard had not been formally adopted (see below for an update on the situation with the Codex Standard) and there remains scientific uncertainty about safe thresholds of gluten for coeliacs. This study was commissioned to evaluate published scientific articles that had investigated safe threshold amounts of gluten in foods in order to determine if it was possible to propose a clinical threshold dose of gluten or a threshold concentration of gluten in food products that would be tolerated by all people with coeliac disease."

This will be done using probabilistic risk assessment techniques. Several input variables are required to undertake food allergy risk assessments. These include: the consumption of the food at an individual meal/eating occasion the concentration of the allergen in the food (ie whether the food contains the allergen and in which concentration) These input variables together determine the exposure to the allergen. Additionally, data on the distribution of minimum eliciting doses (ie threshold distribution) is also required. By combining the threshold distribution and the exposure distribution, the probability of an allergic reaction is determined. The inputs for the probabilistic risk assessment will be based on UK food consumption data, and the combined food allergic threshold datasets developed by the contractors. Furthermore, the allergen cross-contamination data will be based on the FSA’s survey of allergen advisory labelling and allergen content of UK retail pre-packed foods (further information about the FSA survey is available at: FS241038 . The level of peanut, hazelnut, milk and wheat cross-contamination in UK retail foods sampled as part of the FSA survey will also be compared to the action levels proposed by the VITAL programme. This will be done by setting a product-specific action level for samples that tested positive. The results of this project will be used to help inform the FSA’s work to develop risk-based, proportionate action levels. Specifically, the results will help the FSA to: Quantitatively assess the public health risks posed by the levels of allergen cross-contamination found to be present in foods sold on the UK retail market (as identified by the FSA survey) to which UK food allergic consumers are currently being exposed. Give an indication as to whether the proposed levels developed by the VITAL programme are practical in relation to the actual levels of cross-contamination detected in the FSA survey samples. Such information will help the FSA to determine whether the levels UK food allergic consumers would be exposed to if such actions levels were implemented, are comparable to the levels currently being used for allergen control by industry (as identified by the FSA survey) and whether these action levels are likely to be achievable by industry."	"The current regulatory framework within the European Union mandates the declaration of 14 allergens which are deliberately added as ingredients. However, it does not cover the unintentional cross-contamination with allergens or resultant use of advisory labelling. Food manufacturers often use advisory labelling such as ’may contain X allergen‘ to inform allergic consumers of the potential risk of cross-contamination in a food product. While there is some voluntary guidance which includes qualitative advice for industry on how to assess and manage risk from allergenic foods (published by the FSA in 2006), there is currently no quantitative advice from regulatory bodies on the levels of allergen cross-contamination above which advisory labelling should be used. Probabilistic modelling is considered to be the most promising approach to estimate the risk of any allergic reaction following consumption of a food product that contains an allergen due to (unintended) cross-contamination. The Australian Allergen Bureau’s Voluntary Incidental Trace Allergen Labelling (VITAL) programme has produced a quantitative guideline based on probabilistic principles. It is hoped that this guideline will support food producers in assessing the impact of allergen cross-contamination in a food manufacturing environment. The guideline has been positively reviewed by the International Life Sciences Institute’s (ILSI) European Food Allergy Task Force. However, it is yet to be accepted by regulatory bodies such as the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)."

In SCOPE, 3000 first-time mothers were recruited in early pregnancy with the aim of establishing biomarkers to help predict pregnancy outcomes. The BASELINE Study aimed to provide a detailed follow-up of the babies born from SCOPE, including collection and storage of umbilical cord blood, assessment of growth and health, collection of data on breast-feeding and weaning practices, and assessment of eczema status. This project used established clinical protocols to determine the status of 1903 SCOPE/BASELINE babies with regards to FLG mutation, skin barrier function, and food allergen sensitisation and food allergy in the first 2 years of life. FLG mutation status was determined by analysis of cord blood of those antenatally recruited and saliva samples of those postnatally recruited. Skin barrier function was determined at 2 days, 2 months and 6 months of age by measuring the amount of water lost from the skin using a procedure known as Transepidermal Water Loss (TEWL). Food allergen sensitisation status was determined by Skin Prick Tests (SPTs) and blood tests for Specific Immunoglobulin E (SpIgE) antibodies at 2 years of age. Children whose parents reported adverse reactions to foods during the study underwent Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Food Challenges (DBPCFCs) in order to determine their food allergic status. The researchers anticipated that this prospective assessment would allow the genetic and functional status of skin barrier function to be determined and to identify whether these can be used as a means of categorising the children into groups according to their relative risk of developing food allergies.  "	"A significant recent development in the science of food allergy has been recognition that food allergen sensitisation (the precursor to food allergy) could be acquired via routes of exposure other than dietary intake, notably through skin contact. However, whilst the importance of skin exposure in driving sensitisation to food allergens is suspected, and has been clearly demonstrated in animal models, it has not been established with certainty in humans. The skin is constantly exposed to all types of allergens from the environment, and a protective outer layer known as the “skin barrier” prevents these from easily reaching the immune system. Loss-of-function mutations in the gene that produces the skin barrier maintenance protein, filaggrin (FLG), have been shown to be strongly associated with an increased risk of childhood eczema, and food allergy and eczema are known to be strongly associated in infants. The question is, therefore, whether a disrupted skin barrier, which may be genetically determined, facilitates the dermal exposure to food allergens during early life, and could thereby result in sensitisation and ultimately allergy to those foods developing. This study aimed to address this research question. The study aimed to test two specific hypotheses. The primary hypothesis was that abnormal skin barrier function (with or without eczema) predates and predicts food allergen sensitisation, independent of other post-natal dietary and environmental factors. The secondary hypothesis was that any relationship between skin barrier function and food allergen sensitisation is driven by loss-of-function mutations in the FLG protein."

The EAT study recruited 1,303 mothers and their infants onto the study. All mothers on the study were to breastfed exclusively until their infants were three months of age at which point they were randomly split randomly into two groups. One group (the Standard Introduction Group) followed standard UK government advice and were asked to exclusively breastfeed for around six months, after which introduction of allergenic foods was a matter of parental choice. The second group (the Early Introduction Group) was asked to introduce six allergenic foods from the age of three months alongside continued breastfeeding with the help of a dietician and support from the study team. It was important that breast milk remained an important part of all infants’ diet during the first year of life, so all mothers in the study were encouraged to breast feed for at least six months regardless of study group. All infants were closely monitored until three years of age when the impact of the intervention on food allergy and other secondary allergy endpoints (such as eczema and asthma) were assessed and compared between the two study groups."	"The EAT Study was commissioned to investigate when is the best time to introduce allergenic foods into the infant diet in order to minimise the risk of development of later allergic disease, including food allergy. Whilst it is widely accepted that breast milk is best for feeding babies, it is currently unclear whether excluding allergenic foods from the diet before six months of age, is the best way to prevent the development of food allergy and other allergic diseases such as eczema and asthma. The results from this study will be extremely important in helping to answer the question of whether regular consumption of allergenic foods alongside continued breastfeeding in early life could be a preventative strategy for food allergy."

Onset of peanut allergy typically occurs in childhood, with children sometimes reported to react on their first known occasion of eating peanuts. In 1998 the Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COT), which advises the UK Government, issued precautionary advice to mothers whose children have a family history of allergic diseases (asthma, eczema, food allergies etc), that they may wish to avoid peanut consumption during pregnancy and breast-feeding and until the infant is 3 years of age. This advice followed a review of the scientific evidence surrounding peanut allergy which suggested the possibility that infants could be sensitised to peanut allergens as a result of exposure before birth or during breastfeeding. This precautionary advice has recently come under scrutiny, as further scientific evidence on the development of peanut allergy and other food allergies in children is emerging. The Agency has therefore funding a systematic review of all the published scientific literature relevant to early life patterns of exposure or avoidance to major food allergens and the development of food allergy in children, since the COT advice was issued. The findings of this systematic review have helped the Agency to review the precautionary advice issued in 1998."

Information on environmental exposure in the first year of life will be gathered and used for comparisons in children with peanut allergy, normal children and high-risk children (egg allergic) who do not have peanut allergy. It is anticipated that information on 150 individuals will be obtained from the questionnaire."	"In June 1998 the Department of Health (DH) published recommendations aimed at halting the rising incidence of peanut allergy. This guidance was based on the conclusion that peanut sensitization occurring as a result or exposure in utero or via lactation was mechanistically possible. Most presentations of peanut allergy occur on the first known contact the child has had with peanut. The route by which sensitisation occurs is unclear. The possibilities are that sensitization is occurring in utero , via breast milk or via indirect low dose environmental exposure. Much work has focused on maternal consumption of allergen (during pregnancy or lactation) yet interventional studies have failed to demonstrate any benefit of dietary elimination. Recent data is supportive of the possibility of sensitization through low dose cutaneous exposure as a result of the application of arachis oil containing creams to inflamed skin. This study aims to quantify the exposure to environmental allergen during the allergic child's infancy. Environmental peanut exposure can occur through a variety of ways as well as the application of peanut-containing creams. Other important environmental components include the peanut consumption of all household members and the cutaneous contact and vapour inhalation that can result from this. If sensitisation is occurring through environmental exposure, this has important implications for current DH guidance on peanut avoidance and future allergy prevention studies."

This will be achieved by undertaking three separate systematic reviews of the published evidence: systematic review 1 will synthesise the evidence concerning infant milk feeding, including whether the duration of exclusive/predominant breastfeeding during the first year of life, total duration of breast feeding (up to 2 years of age) and the timing of introduction of non-milk feeds (i.e. not breast or formula milk) during the first year of life influences a child’s future risk of developing atopic disease or autoimmune disease systematic review 2 will explore the evidence concerning the timing of introduction of allergenic foods (i.e. cow’s milk, hen’s egg, wheat, peanut, tree nut, fish and soya) into the infant diet during the first year of life and how this influence's a child’s future risk of developing atopic disease or autoimmune disease. It will also explore whether the effects vary according to the duration of exclusive/predominant or any breastfeeding systematic review 3 will explore the evidence concerning maternal and infant diet, including whether early exposure to specific dietary patterns, food groups or nutrients during the first year of life influences a child’s future risk of developing atopic disease or autoimmune disease. It will also explore whether maternal exposure to specific dietary patterns, food groups or nutrients during pregnancy and lactation influence’s a child’s future risk of developing atopic disease or autoimmune disease"	"The Committee of Toxicology (COT, an FSA expert Committee) have been asked by the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN, a Public Health England (PHE) expert Committee) to provide advice on the risks arising from the infant diet that are related to the development of atopic and autoimmune disease. Atopic diseases such as food allergy and eczema occur when the body’s immune system starts to over produce the antibody IgE in response to harmless environmental substances it would normally ignore. Autoimmune diseases such as type I diabetes occur when the body’s immune system starts to produce antibodies that attack and destroy healthy tissues and organs. The outputs from the systematic literature review will be used by COT to make recommendations to SACN. These recommendations will be used (in part) by the UK Government to consider the need for updating or renewing consumer advice on the issue of diet and atopic/autoimmune disease risk, ensuring that this advice is based on the most robust and up-to-date scientific evidence."

"Atopic conditions, including asthma, eczema, rhinoconjunctivitis and food allergy, appear to have increased in prevalence in recent decades in many countries, and are some of the commonest causes of chronic illness in children and young adults living in the UK. An apparent increase in disease prevalence, combined with data from migration studies, suggests that early-life environmental factors may be important modulators of atopic disease risk. Similarly, the autoimmune diseases type I diabetes mellitus (TIDM) and Crohn’s disease also appear to have increased in prevalence in some countries. There has been some interest in the potential for hydrolysed cows’ milk formula to influence the risk of atopic or autoimmune disease. In response, the FSA commissioned a systematic review of the published scientific literature on infant formula containing hydrolysed cows’ milk protein and their potential role in reducing the risk of infants and young children developing atopic outcomes and autoimmune disease."

This will be achieved by measuring differences in specific immunological markers in blood samples collected from LEAP study participants, at different time-points, from birth to 5 years of age. These studies should enable us to understand the processes in the developing immune system that lead to the development of peanut allergy or to oral tolerance to peanut (i.e. no peanut allergy). It is hoped that the project will give us the scientific evidence on which to base our dietary advice on how best to avoid the development of peanut allergy, especially when combined with the results of other randomly controlled trials on the timing of introduction of allergenic foods into the infant diet and allergy risk, of which there are several ongoing worldwide (including the Agency funded project FS231063 – the EAT study). In particular, Public Health England is currently undertaking a major review of the evidence underpinning UK Government recommendations regarding complementary and young child feeding. The immunological results generated by this project when coupled with the findings of the LEAP clinical trial itself are likely to be informative to that review."	"Peanut allergy affects up to 1 in 50 children in the UK. There is currently scientific uncertainty about whether children should avoid peanuts to escape sensitisation or instead should eat peanuts to induce early oral tolerance and thus prevent peanut allergy. It is thought that there is a critical window of time during early infant life when the immune system is developing which may be a key time for the development of allergies, but it is not clear how the route, timing and dose of exposure to food allergens during this period might influence whether the child develops an allergy or not. One theory that has emerged recently is that high levels of consumption of food allergens at an early age may in fact prevent the development of food allergy by inducing tolerance, but there is a need to gain more definitive evidence to be able to support or reject this theory. To achieve this, a major clinical intervention study is being funded by the US National Institute of Health, called the Learning Early About Peanuts study - www.leapstudy.com - in which young children at high risk of developing peanut allergy are being recruited and randomised to either eat peanut at high levels from an early age or to exclude peanut from their diet. A series of diagnostic tests will be done over 5 years to monitor whether the children develop peanut allergy or not."

Also included in the study were two control groups (sensitised but non-allergic and non sensitised non-egg allergic) of 20 children each. Egg-allergic patients underwent repeated annual open oral egg challenges with well cooked egg. If their response was negative, uncooked (pasteurised) egg was introduced over time to confirm resolution or persistence of allergy. Blood samples were taken and used to measure specific IgE as well as total and specific IgG. T cell proliferation and T-helper cytokine production (IL-4/10 and interferon-gamma) were measured annually, using frozen peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples and employing flow cytometry and intracellular staining methods to demonstrate changes in children whose allergy resolves or persists. Subjects from both control groups were tested at enrolment and again in the final year of the project."

In particular, differences in memory versus naive T cell responses and allergy specific T cell precursor frequency will be investigated. Also to be investigated was the role of suppressor T cells and whether IgE mediated facilitated antigen presentation (FAP) can explain the observed differences. In the second stage of the study, observations on T cell responses were extended to include children with peanut sensitisation who were able to tolerate peanut. This was so that clinical differences between peanut allergic and peanut sensitised individuals could be established. The third stage of the study investigated the site (via the skin or gut) where sensitization to peanut has occurred in peanut allergic individuals. Memory T cells express 'homing receptors' on their surface that assist the circulation of the T cell through lymph nodes, lymphatics and the blood before returning to the tissue where the T cell is most likely to encounter the allergen again. The researchers will investigate two specific homing receptors - the Cutaneous Lymphocyte-associated antigen (CLA) - a skin homing receptor, the expression of which implies sensitization in the skin and ?4?7 integrin - a gut homing receptor, the expression of which implies sensitization in the gut. These studies compared the proliferative T cell responses to peanut in peanut allergic children amongst the CLA-expressing (skin homing) and ?4?7 integrin-expressing (gut homing) T cell populations."	"Peanut allergy is a severe, potentially life-threatening condition in children characterised by severe anaphylactic reactions triggered by even minute quantities of peanut allergen. It remains unclear why some children develop peanut allergy, others tolerate peanut their whole lives and other children outgrow their peanut allergy to subsequently develop tolerance. It is equally unclear why some children have evidence of specific IgE to peanut or a positive skin prick test to peanut and nevertheless eat large quantities of peanut without ill effect. In previous FSA-funded work, clinical and immunological observations relating to the different states of peanut allergy and tolerance have been made. This study enabled us to further understand T cell responses in the pathogenesis of food allergy by understanding the mechanisms that underlie T cell responses in tolerant individuals and devise new immunomodulatory strategies that could allow us to normalise T cell responses in future therapies."

Part of EuroPrevall was concerned with gathering accurate information from across Europe on the patterns of prevalence of food allergies in infants, children and adults. Project T07046 formed the UK part of EuroPrevall which collected data on the prevalence of food allergies from birth to two years of age. Pregnant women were recruited onto the study so as to create a birth cohort of over 1200 babies, who werefollowed from birth to 2 years of age. At recruitment, parents were asked to complete a detailed questionnaire to gather data on their allergic and dietary history as well as on all sorts of other relevant environmental and experiential factors . A further questionnaire was completed at one and two years of age to collect information on the child’s health, environmental and dietary exposures. Any infant developing signs of a food allergy during the study was assessed in clinic using validated and standardised protocols to establish if they had a food allergy or not. For every symptomatic child on the study, 2 control children were recruited from the cohort and followed in the same way. In addition to the above, and unique to the UK birth cohort, detailed prospective information were collected on the child’s dietary intake from birth to 12 months of age, via a diary record. This enabled the researchers to investigate the relationship between early infant diet and the development of food allergy."	"There is currently a lack of reliable data on the actual, as opposed to reported, prevalence of food allergies in the UK, especially among children. Previous attempts to establish prevalence have not always been representative of the general population, have used different endpoints and diagnostic criteria, or have been based on adults rather than children. This makes them difficult to interpret and compare. There is therefore a real need for robust studies using validated methods and appropriate diagnostic criteria to establish the true prevalence of food allergies in UK children. There is also a need to improve our understanding of the current weaning practices of mothers in the UK, and to understand what influence, if any, these weaning practices, and in particular the timing of introduction of allergenic foods (e.g. peanuts, eggs, milk, wheat) may have on the developing immune system and the later development of food sensitisation and food allergy.

All children with positive screening skin prick tests (SPTs) to peanut were offered a formal double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge with peanut to confirm the diagnosis."	"The UK prevalence of sensitisation to peanut was found to be 1.3% in a single-centre birth cohort born in 1989-90. In a later cohort, born in 1995, the prevalence had more than doubled, as reported by the same centre. The 1998 COT report advised pregnant mothers and infants from atopic families to avoid peanuts. It is not known what effect this advice has had on the dietary habits of atopic and non-atopic mothers, or if its intended effect on the prevalence of peanut sensitisation in their offspring has been realised. The study investigated approximately 2000 UK children born between March 1999 (9 months after the COT report) and March 2000.

"Allergy to kiwi fruit initially presented in the UK population in adults as a cross-reaction to latex or birch pollen. After some 20 years in the UK diet, allergy started to present in early childhood, often on the first known exposure. The paediatric at-risk group is highly atopic and the symptoms of kiwi allergy can be severe. The differences between adults and children are thought to occur either because of the timing of exposure, or because they are reacting to different allergens. Kiwi fruit has been a common component of the UK diet for only 20 years and therefore serves as a model for how allergy develops in a population when a new food is introduced."

"In August 2009, the Government revised its advice to consumers about eating peanuts during pregnancy, breastfeeding and the first few years of life, in relation to the risk of developing peanut allergy in childhood. The change in advice followed a major review of the scientific evidence that showed there is no clear evidence that eating or not eating peanuts (or foods containing peanuts) during pregnancy, breastfeeding or early childhood has any effect on the chances of a child developing a peanut allergy. Therefore, the Government’s previous advice that women may wish to avoid peanuts during pregnancy and breastfeeding and not introduce peanuts into their child’s diet before three years of age, if their child has a family history of allergy, was no longer appropriate. The Government is currently funding a number of studies on peanut and other food allergies, with the aim of improving understanding of how and under what circumstances these conditions develop.

"Coeliac disease is a life-long autoimmune disease caused by intolerance to gluten, a protein found predominately in wheat, barley and rye cereals. In those affected by coeliac disease, consumption of gluten causes damage to the gut lining, resulting in a wide range of symptoms such as bloating, diarrhoea and nausea, as well as longer term health consequences if the disease is not managed. Management involves a strict gluten-free diet. In the UK, people with medically diagnosed coeliac disease may access some of their gluten-free substitute foods on prescription but there are also a growing number of foods available that make “gluten-free” claims. There is no specific evidence base that compares the nutritional composition of gluten free foods to standard products and it is not well understood whether or not the diet of those following a gluten-free diet is nutritionally adequate. The Agency identified a policy need to identify, collate and review the existing scientific evidence on the nutritional adequacy of a typical gluten-free diet, with particular regard to the nutrients iron, calcium, folate, Vitamin D and the B Vitamins. The purpose of the research was to inform the Agency’s understanding of whether the diet of UK consumers with coeliac disease, who are following a gluten-free diet, is nutritionally adequate. If not, there is a need for specific dietary advice or other strategies to ensure that these consumers can maintain a nutritionally adequate diet whilst avoiding gluten containing cereals."

These tasks were: An accompanied shop in their usual supermarket where participants were asked to talk aloud about what they were thinking when they chose each food product An in-depth semi-structured interview which followed on from the accompanied shop and was conducted in each participants own home A Product Choice Reasoning Task (PCRT) designed specifically for this study. Each participant was given 13 potentially problematic food products and asked to ‘think aloud’ and say if they would be happy to buy the product and how they reached their decision The results from each of the above methods were recorded, transcribed and analysed considering key themes to identify patterns of behaviour and key factors involved in food purchasing decisions."	"Peanuts and other nuts are an increasingly common cause of food allergy and are the most frequent cause of severe and fatal food allergic reactions. Avoidance of these trigger foods is therefore essential for those affected by nut allergies. This requires constant vigilance and can be difficult to achieve as the presence of nut allergens may not always be obvious and information about them may potentially be confusing to consumers. At present, there are relatively few studies that have looked into the behaviour and decision making processes food allergic consumers tend to adopt to help them avoid food allergens that they are sensitive to, and how difficult they find this to achieve. In particular, little work has been carried out on what sources of information food allergic consumers find useful in making food purchasing decisions and how they use and interpret food labels and other information in the decision making process. Such research is needed by the Agency to help provide the UK food allergic consumer accurate and useful information to allow them to make safe and informed food choices. This study investigated how people with peanut and tree nut allergies use food labels and the types of strategies they adopt when selecting foods to minimise the risk of triggering an allergic reaction."

The research will be split into 2 parts: Part A (during 2014) This involves a 4-phase programme of qualitative and quantitative research, which will inform the implementation of the FIR allergen rules before they take effect December 2014. Phase 1: a scoping phase including a relevant literature review; the development of relevant quality of life measures for food intolerance; and a sampling strategy for future phases which will be informed by placing some questions on a YouGov survey Phase 2: In depth qualitative research consisting of 75 interviews and diaries with food allergic and intolerant individuals (including parents and carers) from across the UK to explore information seeking practices and preferences for foods not pre-packed Phase 3: A national survey that will characterise the prevalence of these preferences as well as establishing how they relate to measures of quality of life.

In total, 148 isolates were whole genome sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq sequencer. Shigatoxin typing was performed by in silico (computer-based) Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and phylogenetic analysis (analysis of the evolution of genetic structure over time) was based on core genome single nucleotide polymorphisms. This pilot has shown the potential of whole genome sequencing to advance our knowledge base on the types of E.coli O157 strains circulating in the environment in Scotland and how these relate to the strains which are transmitted through the food chain and those which lead to illness in humans."	"Verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli O157 (VTEC) is a gastrointestinal zoonotic pathogen of public health importance in the UK and worldwide. Although the disease is relatively rare, Scotland has one of the highest reported incidences in Europe (4.8 cases per 100,000 in 2011). VETC is a major cause of haemorrhagic colitis and haemolytic uraemic syndrome in humans. The current understanding of E.coli O157 evolution and epidemiology is limited. Therefore this project was commissioned to examine geographical distribution, host specificity, distribution in food chain, strain phylogeny and disease severity. Typing of VTEC has traditionally been carried out by phage typing and pulsed field gel electrophoresis. The developments in next generation sequencing (NGS) have now made it possible to readily sequence isolates at a reasonable cost. The availability of whole genome information enables a number of methods to be applied that can be used to characterise the particular isolate and to determine the genetic relatedness of isolates. These include single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis, pathotyping and multi-locus variable number tandem repeats (MLVA)."

In order to provide the FSA with information on the most likely causes of contaminated root vegetables, this study plans to mimic six plausible different accidental scenarios that could result in inadvertent contamination or spread of contamination. These scenarios are described below. Pre-harvest: the deposition of contaminated manure onto root crops close to harvest the application of contaminated irrigation water onto a root crop close to harvest. This scenario would also provide the FSA with information on crop contact with contaminated runoff during a heavy rainfall or flood event water application the night before harvest, which is common for some crops during periods of low rainfall (because crops such as baby carrots can be damaged by capped soil [a crust of dry surface soil]) Post-harvest: he use of contaminated wash water for root vegetable washing and polishing the impact of previously washing a contaminated batch of crops on an uncontaminated batch of crops without changing the wash water crop handling by a gloved or ungloved shedding harvest worker with poor hygienic practices after visiting lavatory The work will be separated into a study of pre-harvest and post-harvest contamination. The pre-harvest studies will involve growing experimental spring-planted crops at Harper Adams University grown under relevant UK field environmental conditions with the application of an appropriate degree of contamination in either water or manure close to harvest. The post-harvest work will identify the persistence of zoonotic agents through product handling from harvest to consumer, delivered via representative multiple retail and independent retail supply chains. In addition, the decontamination efficacy of industry practices of crop washing and polishing (for carrots only) will be assessed. The fate of verocytotoxic E.coli applied in experimental treatments will be determined both following contamination and after exposure to simulated supply chain conditions."	"Consumption of fresh fruit and vegetables is associated with good nutrition because they provide an important source of vitamins, minerals and biochemical co-factors. In recent years, however, there have been a number of high-profile foodborne illness outbreaks that have been traced back to fresh produce (Hutchison and Monaghan, 2013). A common issue with trying to trace the source of an outbreak is that the contaminated food may have been consumed or spoiled and disposed of before the outbreak is even identified. For the 2011 VTEC outbreak, the investigation concluded it was likely that contaminated soil on the surface of root vegetables was the source of the outbreak strain. This project aims to provide evidence to underpin future risk assessment and food safety advice on the risks associated with soiled vegetables.

In this study it is proposed that the potential of VTEC to internalise in leafy vegetables in conditions representative of pre-harvest growth will be determined. The research will assess the impact of different factors on the ability of VTEC to internalise, by carrying out a comparative analysis to a baseline model dataset. The second part of the research will investigate whether internalisation in leafy green vegetables alters the pathogenic potential of the bacteria for humans. The data generated will be of use to producers of leafy vegetables and help to inform in the event of a produce-associated outbreak. A combination of approaches will be used, including microbiology, microscopy and cell culture. The leafy vegetables selected and reported by the FAO/WHO seem to present the greatest concern in terms of microbiological hazards. The plants used in this study are spinach, lettuce, alfalfa, sweet basil and tomato. The plants are grown under hydroponic conditions in sterile conditions before being transferred to pots containing agar or soil, depending on the plant. Light microscopy is used to visualise and localise the bacteria internalised in the plant tissue. To enumerate the internalised population and viable population of bacteria, quantitative PCR will be used. Bacterial gene expression will also be investigated as a measure of the pathogen’s adaptability to the internalised plant tissue environment."	"Plants can act as hosts for a wide range of microbes with colonisation occurring on all tissue types to varying extents. There have been a number of foodborne outbreaks from consumption of contaminated fresh produce, including the E.coli O157:H7 PT8 outbreak in 2011 associated with soil-contaminated vegetables, which was one of the largest we have seen in the UK. This proposal aims to investigate the ability of E.coli O157:H7 to internalise into a variety of plant species, under commercially relevant conditions. Then the pathogenic potential of internalised bacteria and the subsequent risk posed to human health will be assessed. A comparative analysis of internalisation using microscopy to visualise internalised bacteria, and microbiology and molecular techniques to quantify internalised bacteria, will be performed. The overall aim of the project is to provide growers and producers with robust data, and to provide information during outbreak investigations."

These were: a scoping stage to help inform the second stage of a quantitative survey a quantitative survey of both food business operators and local authorities to gain a better understanding of how the guidance has been received and used a qualitative follow-up stage to explore more deeply some of the issues from the survey The Agency will use the results of the evaluation in order to consider enhancing the content and delivery of the guidance in the future."	"Serious outbreaks of Ecoli O157 were reported in Scotland during 1996 and Wales during 2005. They resulted in the deaths of some affected individuals and in serious long-term health problems for others. Both outbreaks were attributed to cross-contamination arising from poorly managed food handling practices in the commercial setting. In response to this, the Agency established a programme of work to reduce the risk of similar outbreaks occurring in the future. In 2011 the Agency embarked on the development and dissemination of new guidance for industry and enforcement officers. The purpose of this guidance was: to increase recognition of the threat that Ecoli O157 poses to public health the need for stringent measures during food production to control cross-contamination risks associated with the pathogen. The guidance was produced upon principles that were subject to a formal public consultation in 2010. In February 2011 the Agency published the detailed guidance and an additional fact sheet summarising its content. Training for local authorities enforcement officers was also provided alongside this.

Measures aimed at doing this may provide pre-slaughter control to reduce human cases of infection arising through food chain contamination of the slaughter process, or contamination of fresh produce. It should additionally offer benefits by reducing risks to humans from environmental exposures, including those arising through direct animal contact at open farms or in the rural environment. The first part of the study involved a review of published data on the cost, practicality, evidence for adoption and efficacy of various on-farm controls. This information was used to examine the potential of controls to reduce E. coli O157 shedding in cattle on UK farms, to estimate the costs associated with their implementation, and to calculate the possible public health benefits that would result from their uptake across the UK. Practicality and efficiency are important criteria for the adoption of on-farm controls. However, the major issue with on-farm controls is that cattle do not exhibit signs of infection from E. coli O157. Therefore as there is no production loss, such controls convey no direct benefit to the farmer or producer. There therefore needed to be an understanding of farmers’ intrinsic behaviours that underpin their motivations for adopting improved on-farm controls. Intrinsic patterns of behaviour are also influenced by the extrinsic demands that may be driven by: producers or retailers for market gain legislators or the industry seeking to implement or encourage controls for the public good The second part of the work therefore aimed to identify both the intrinsic and extrinsic factors which impact on the attitudes of farm owners, including open farm managers and food producers, to on-farm control of E. coli O157. Finally, stakeholder engagement was undertaken to share the intelligence obtained from the above objectives, but also to seek their views on the implementation of controls."	"E. coli O157 is a relatively rare but significant gastrointestinal pathogen in the UK. Complications of the infection can lead to renal damage and death. E. coli O157 is shed in the faeces of ruminant animals. It has been implicated in outbreaks of human disease via the cross-contamination of foods and direct contact with the faeces of affected animals. The public inquiry into the September 2005 outbreak of E. coli O157 in South Wales recommended that the feasibility of identifying 'supershedder' cattle on farms should be explored as a potential means of reducing the likelihood of spreading the pathogen to other cattle. The routine testing of livestock may not be a cost-effective or practicable means of preventing 'supershedders' entering the slaughterhouse. As a result, measures aimed at reducing shedding in the entire herd, prior to slaughter, could be easier to administer while providing a similar level of control."

The study will validate, with statistical analysis, the detection procedures and compare them with current laboratory protocols."	"Verocytotoxin producing Escherichia coli (VTEC), is an important human pathogen and, in the UK, strains belonging to serotype O157:H7 have been predominantly associated with outbreaks of haemorrhagic colitis and haemolytic uraemic syndrome, two potentially life-threatening conditions.

However, atypical sorbitol-fermenting strains have recently emerged in the UK which cannot be identified on the standard detection media. This project therefore aims to develop new methods that can be used for the detection and identification of sorbitol-fermenting strains of Escherichia coli O157:H-. A validated detection method will enable the food industry to inform food safety management systems, to support enforcement authorities and to facilitate the identification and tracing of surbitol-fermenting VTEC O157:H- organisms causing illness.

The survey’s scope, sampling methodology, analytical methods and reporting of data provisions were outlined in the commission decision of 5 November 2010, concerning a financial contribution from the European Union towards a coordinated monitoring programme on the prevalence of Listeria monocytogenes in certain ready-to-eat foods to be carried out in the Member States. A copy can be found at: http://eu.vlex.com/vid/coordinated-prevalence-monocytogenes-ready-eat-226600758 One of the requirements of the commission decision was that the National Reference Laboratory (NRL) undertake all analysis for this survey.

These products differed in their characteristics with respect to the environment they present to M.bovis or any other microorganism found to be present (e.g VTEC). Information on values for characteristics such as salt and pH came from the expertise in the team carrying out the study, but measurements were also made. Methods for detecting, isolating and calculating both M.bovis and VTEC O157:H7 from milk and cheeses were developed and evaluated in this study. The ability to detect and isolate non-O157 VTEC (e.g. O26, etc.) from cheeses was also investigated. Cheeses were manufactured in the laboratory and inoculated separately with both species of bacteria. The microflora and characteristics of the cheeses were monitored throughout the life of the cheeses, so that the impact on the growth and survivability of M.bovis and VTEC could be evaluated effectively. This enabled the safety of raw milk cheeses to be assessed more precisely. The project team consisted of experts in the areas of M.bovis, VTEC and cheese and were supported by a steering group comprising cheese manufacturers and other experts in cheese production."

The lack of an effective process capable of reliably removing norovirus from oysters is an important knowledge gap and a priority for further research. Project objectives are to: Carry out a critical review of international literature to evaluate the effectiveness of depuration in removing norovirus from oysters, the mechanism by which norovirus is specifically bound and retained in oysters, and to identify new tools and/or approaches for viral depuration. Complete a series of pilot experiments to investigate depuration of norovirus from Pacific oysters using a novel approach to release norovirus from its specific receptor. Facilitate an industry engagement strategy to elicit industry input and disseminate the findings of the literature review and preliminary experiments. Develop recommendations on future research and/or field trials that could be undertaken to underpin the commercial application of depuration by oyster growers. Proposed approach: Literature review A review of the published and non-published literature will be carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of depuration in removing norovirus from oysters, examination of the mechanism by which norovirus specifically binds to ligands within the oyster tissues, and to identify potential new approaches and tools for depuration. The literature review component of the project will also provide information that will form basis for selection of the most promising compounds (treatments) to trial in the pilot studies. Key considerations regarding which compounds to trial will include the need to utilise those that are non-toxic to humans at the concentrations used to treat oysters, are of sufficiently broad a range to degrade all ligands in oysters that bind noroviruses/other viruses, and do not significantly alter the sensory attributes of the oysters (eg taste, smell etc.) Pilot depuration experiments A series of pilot experiments will be carried out to investigate depuration of norovirus in Pacific oysters using a novel approach that aims to release norovirus from its specific receptor/ligand within oyster tissues. Specific compounds will be trialled immediately before depuration that may destroy these receptors is carried out, avoiding the release of norovirus during depuration. These preliminary studies will investigate whether this approach has the potential to reduce norovirus levels significantly. If these initial studies show efficient reductions in norovirus, further work would be needed to evaluate the commercial application of such a technique."	"The foodborne viruses’ research programme aims to gather data to provide a robust science and evidence base to inform development of a risk management programme on foodborne viruses, with a particular focus on norovirus. Norovirus is the most common cause of infectious intestinal disease in the UK. It is highly infectious, but the illness is generally mild and people usually recover fully within two to three days. Most norovirus infections are thought to spread from person-to-person, although contaminated foods are also thought to account for a proportion of cases. Food can be contaminated with norovirus by infected food handlers or as a result of contamination occurring during primary production, eg shellfish or other fresh produce. The presence of norovirus in foods eaten raw, such as oysters or salad vegetables, can present a particular risk to consumer safety as the virus is not destroyed before consumption by heat processes such as cooking. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has published two Scientific Opinions on foodborne viruses in 2011 and 2012. These contain a number of recommendations on potential control options for shellfish (particularly those eaten raw) and the need to gather data, including further research to establish and optimise the effectiveness of depuration and relaying for NoV reduction.

"Contamination of bivalve shellfish with norovirus (causing gastroenteritis) is recognised as a major human health risk associated with the consumption of contaminated shellfish. Risk assessment and management relies on E. coli levels as an indicator of faecal (sewage) contamination in shellfish.

There is currently a lack of quantitative data on the prevalence, distribution and levels of norovirus in oysters and oyster production/harvesting areas within the UK. Over recent years considerable progress has been made towards the development of sensitive molecular methods (PCR) to detect norovirus in shellfish. The Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas) has developed a quantitative method for detection of norovirus in bivalve shellfish which targets the shellfish digestive glands (hepatopancreas), based on the CEN draft standard for detection of viruses in food.

The review included a comparison between norovirus and other viral models with respect to environmental degradation and bioaccumulation factors and also considered the significance of wastewater discharges from diffuse sources (eg pleasure craft) and their capacity to be controlled by norovirus exclusion zones. Review activities incorporated the essential elements of a systematic review supported by direct contact with known working groups. Overseas experience with respect to exclusion/buffer zones from European settings and US/NSSP based suppliers was also reviewed. A questionnaire was used to construct a database, and where positive examples were identified information was sought to generate potential case study illustrations. An assessment of the level of the potential impact exclusion zones may have upon the UK oyster industry was carried out. This included construction of a UK-wide database of oyster harvest bed status using available information (eg shellfish hygiene classification, sanitary survey and pollution reduction plan data) and gathering of shellfish industry opinion on management options/business stability. The study also aimed to assess whether existing computer modelling tools previously developed to meet E.coli environmental regulatory requirements in the Shellfish Water Directive could be utilised for norovirus ‘exclusion zones’. This component of the project included a sensitivity analysis for the potential extent of prospective exclusion zones to meet a range of potential shellfish flesh norovirus standards using outputs from the literature review. Additional data requirements and future model developments required to adapt models for this purpose were identified. The potential for developing a generic viral risk management matrix for use by harvesters that incorporates an exclusion/proximity component was also evaluated."

EFSA suggested several potential preventative control options including introduction of prohibition zones (‘exclusion’ or ‘buffer’ zones) around sewage discharges where shellfish may not be harvested. Exclusion zones are likely to be a key risk management option for further consideration at EU level.

Method performance characteristics were acceptable for the non-N-hydroxylated toxins oxidised by peroxide prior to HPLC quantitation. This included good evidence for acceptable toxin recovery, precision, ruggedness and sensitivity and with no evidence of matrix-related signal suppression. However, with poor method performance for N-hydroxylated toxins, the HPLC method would not be safe to implement for scallops in its current form and further work to improve the method performance is recommended. With regard to clams and razors, validation results showed that the HPLC method was selective and sensitive enough to detect and quantify the presence of each toxin peak in both hard clams and razors. The linearity of the method was shown to be good over a wide range of toxin concentrations and toxin recoveries were similar to those described previously for other species. The precision of the method for both razors and hard clams was shown to be statistically acceptable over the short, medium and long – term and comparable to values reported previously for other species. Ruggedness experiments showed that the method was robust for all parameters investigated. Method performance results obtained throughout the study were used to calculate levels of Measurement Uncertainty (MU) for the analysis of PSTs in hard clams and razors, with results being generally lower and more consistent than the range of uncertainties reported previously for mussels. With regard to oysters and cockles, validation results showed that the analysis of PSTs in oysters and cockles was selective and sensitive enough to detect and quantify the presence of each toxin peak. The relationship between HPLC instrumental response and toxin concentration was shown to be linear over an appropriate working range and toxin recoveries were similar to those described previously for mussels. The precision of the method for oysters and cockles was shown to be acceptable over the short, medium and long - term. Variability in method performance during these assessments was similar to or improved from values reported previously for mussels and all found to be statistically acceptable.

An evaluation of the strength and robustness of the identified evidence is presented and knowledge gaps that might be addressed through future research work, to support indicator species use, are identified. This study is intended to support a review and possible simplification of the official classification of shellfish production areas across the UK. For any of the shellfish species harvested to be considered a suitable indicator, and in order to protect public health, that species must be shown to consistently accumulate E.coli to an equal or greater extent than any other. Previous FSA workshops, involving relevant scientific experts from across the UK, have considered evidence available in support of potential options for changes to the current classification system. These have identified a certain amount of information (based on routine monitoring data from England and Wales) that showed mussels accumulate E.coli to a greater extent than some bivalve species, but not necessarily all. This critical review considers the amount and strength of wider evidence to support the suitability of mussels as a reliable indicator of uptake of E.coli in other commercially harvested bivalve molluscs and assesses the implications of adopting other indicator species options, together with any associated public health impacts. Options with regard to sampling effort for classification monitoring and impacts on classification status awarded to production areas are also presented."	"Shellfish waters can become contaminated by sewage effluent discharges and surface water run-off from agricultural land, which may contaminate shellfish with pathogenic organisms known to cause human illness. EU food law requires a range of official controls for live bivalve molluscs to ensure that shellfish placed on the market are safe to eat. Statutory hygiene classification and monitoring of shellfish production areas, based on Escherichia coli as an indicator of faecal contamination levels, determines the extent of post-harvest processing required. Shellfish from more heavily contaminated sites are required to be relayed or depurated (cleansed in clean seawater) to reduce contamination to acceptable levels, or thoroughly cooked, before consumption. In the UK, commercially harvested species within a production area are currently monitored and each species bed is individually classified. This is a costly and resource intensive exercise. The FSA is committed to reviewing this system to ensure it remains fit for purpose, utilises available resources effectively and provides adequate protection for public health."

"This was a Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/Food Standards Agency research, funded under the Government Partnership Award (GPA) scheme. Campylobacter jejuni is the predominant bacterial agent of human gastrointestinal infection in the UK. Whilst the disease in humans is not generally fatal, it is highly unpleasant and a significant public health burden. As part of the body's first defense against infection, the immune system can generate a toxic gas called nitric oxide (NO) that, when dissolved in the fluid around the infecting bacteria, is able to destroy them. It has recently been discovered that C. jejuni can resist NO. To do this the bacterium must first be able to detect the toxic gas and then produce proteins to neutralise the NO. A putative NO detector and NO responsive regulator (the NssR-regulon) have been identified in C. jejuni . This study characterised this NO responsive network, identifying whether it is essential for infection and investigated how it enables >i>C. jejuni to resist NO. In future, the results could be used to develop novel ways of controlling this bacterium by blocking its ability to resist NO, thus making it sensitive to this killing agent."

Physical enrichment methods, including (immuno) magnetic separation, which are commercially available in convenient technology, will be assessed for sensitivity, specificity, ease of use and compatibility with detection devices. The outcomes of this early stage work will enable the highest number of campylobacter to be presented to a suitable detection assay.

This project will also add benefit to another FSAS-funded project (FS421003) which is considering sources of campylobacter and their contribution to human cases of infection – as it will provide data on another potential source. Additionally, experts at an FSA workshop in January 2012 recommended that molecular techniques, such as whole genome sequencing and MLST, should be used to analyse samples from reservoirs that were potential sources of human infection and where data was currently lacking. The findings from both this study and FS421003 would be used by the Campylobacter risk management programme to target interventions appropriately. The main objectives will be to: determine the prevalence of campylobacter in wild game pheasants processed in Approved Game Handling Establishments (AGHE) in Scotland identify the main strains of campylobacter isolated from pheasants determine if the strains of campylobacter from pheasants are the same as in broilers and humans in Scotland"	"This project will be a two-year part-time MSc project undertaken at the University of Edinburgh Vet School. There is evidence of campylobacter colonisation in pheasants in the available literature (Dipineto et al 2008;Nebola et al 2007) and from preliminary research carried out by Dr Ken Forbes (University of Aberdeen) in an FSAS-funded project (S14006) . In this project, Dr Ken Forbes isolated Campylobacter spp. of public health importance from pheasants in Scotland in 2006. Two different multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) strains were isolated, ST45 and ST262, from five pheasants, but due to the small sample size it is unclear whether this is a true representation of the strains colonising pheasants or a more diverse range exists. Also, without knowing the prevalence of campylobacter in pheasants the relevance of this source of these strains on public health is unknown. The preliminary results are interesting from the public health point of view because ST45 is very common in humans, poultry (chicken, turkeys) and has also been found in other birds, such as ducks, geese and starling, as well as in environmental samples (water). ST262 is also quite common and has been found in poultry (chicken), but it seems to be more associated with sheep, cattle and farm slurry. Therefore analysing the strains of campylobacter isolated from the pheasants at the approved game handling establishments will provide an indication of the potential routes of infection for these birds (e.g.  bird- adapted Campylobacter spp. (ST45) or exposure from farm environments (ST262))."

"There is currently no available inexpensive rapid test for campylobacter that can be used on farm. Lateral flow test strips can be constructed employing a standard sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). This is not a difficult assay to construct as long as optimal reagents are selected. Performance of the assay simply involves applying a few drops of diluted sample onto a sample application area and then allowing the assay to proceed until a result is seen by the appearance of one or two coloured bands. A positive result will demonstrate two coloured bands (one in the test zone and one in the control zone) and a negative result will show a coloured band in the control zone only. The intensity of the coloured band in the test zone is an indication of the concentration of campylobacter in the original sample. Therefore, if a reference scoring card can be created it can be used to interpret the intensity of the positive band in an unknown test sample in terms of organisms per ml (or gram)."

The researchers used mathematical models to assess this theory and determine a set of mechanisms which can explain the data. It was hoped that the data set produced would be able to give an indication of the diversity of different strains of campylobacter and how this can change over a given time period. This was important as it enabled the development of strategies and interventions to reduce colonisation.

As a result, investigating measures which will limit the number of campylobacter-positive birds in flocks is a major research priority. Observational studies can examine the burden of campylobacter at the flock level. However, it is difficult to determine whether flocks have lower levels of campylobacter due to individual chickens being difficult to colonise or due to the rate of transmission between chickens being much lower. Traditional observational experiments can only be used to assess transmission and susceptibility independently of each other. A new approach, using mathematical models, was used to estimate both susceptibility and transmission from a single experiment. This meant that an enhanced understanding of the biological mechanisms at work within colonised flocks was achieved."

This could lead to the development of new intervention measures to control campylobacter and improvements in animal welfare to reduce stress. This is a Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/FSA research project funded under the Government Partnership Award scheme. The research investigated the hypothesis that noradrenaline, produced by poultry in response to production stresses such as thinning/transport/etc, makes it easier for C. jejuni in the gut to colonise and then travel across the gut epithelium to other tissues, leading to increased campylobacter numbers in the bird and thus increasing the risk of disease transmission from bird to human. Environment and farming practices all influence the microbiology of the farm. Modern chicken production is highly intensive and even the presence of a visitor can cause stress to the animals. The study hypothesis was that increased levels of stress in chickens may lead to higher levels of campylobacter in the birds and cause the bacterium to behave in a very different way from normal. The reasons for this are not clear, but may involve changes in the populations of protective bacteria in the gut, alterations in immunity, and increased pathogen fitness compromising the animal's ability to resist infection. Animals stressed or in pain release neurotransmitters throughout their body. For example, a stressed chicken being caught and transported to the slaughterhouse will have higher levels of neurotransmitters in its gut. The main neurotransmitter in this respect is noradrenaline and levels of this can increase rapidly during stress. Noradrenaline will affect the animal by altering the permeability of the gut cells and by changing fluid balance, but it will also change the nature and behaviour of pathogenic bacteria in the gut. Work at the University of Bristol had shown that campylobacter grow much more quickly and are more motile in the presence of noradrenaline. Other research on Salmonella and E. coli showed that bacterial cell surface structures, important in animal infection, are also influenced by noradrenaline."

Poultry plants participating in an Agency-funded campylobacter monitoring programme (FS241051A) will be invited to take part in the project. These plants will be visited with carcasses sampled at various stages of the process to ascertain where contamination of the carcass is reduced or increased. While carrying out the measurements, the process operations will be observed to identify possible factors that could influence changes in microbial load. Modifications or interventions will be suggested to minimise the increase or enhance the decrease in campylobacter numbers on post-chilled carcasses. Limited molecular studies will be undertaken on isolates collected from the sampling trials to investigate if different species or certain company strains are influencing the shift in campylobacter numbers through processing where no physical reason can be found. Previous studies suggest cross-contamination onto negative flocks is a less important factor for controlling campylobacters on carcasses. Therefore this project will mainly focus on colonised flocks and how to limit carcass surface contamination. However, since the original cross-contamination work from positive to negative flocks was carried out in only a few plants, studies regarding the contamination of negative flocks will also be undertaken to confirm this is the case and identify where cross-contamination occurs across a range of plants."	"The sources of the campylobacters found on carcasses are the intestinal contents of flocks colonised by campylobacters and their faecally-contaminated feathers. Various stages during poultry processing have been reported to contribute to the contamination on the final carcass. These include scalding, de-feathering, evisceration, and chilling. De-feathering and evisceration have both been identified as particularly important processes for contaminating carcasses. Contamination occurs not only from feathers and gut contents of the same carcass, but also between different carcasses (cross-contamination) due to the high speed and mechanised nature of the poultry slaughter process, combined with extensive use of water."

To enable interpretation of any changes in the incidence and types of campylobacter causing human disease attributable to the food chain, it is essential to maintain the current level of surveillance. This will be achieved by the molecular characterisation of all positively identified campylobacter isolates submitted to the routine microbiology laboratory at John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford over the three-year funding period. Once isolated in the laboratory, campylobacter isolates will be placed onto charcoal swabs and stored refrigerated to maintain their viability. Swabs will be collected several times a week and transported to the University of Oxford's Department of Zoology laboratories, where they will be re-plated and growth used for both DNA preparation and isolate storage at -80°C. Multilocus sequence typing will be performed immediately, using established protocols and the data obtained deposited in the web-based pubMLST campylobacter database ( http://pubmlst.org/campylobacter ) which currently contains data on over 11,000 campylobacter isolates."

Changes in the genetic structure of the population will be used to inform a mathematical model that simulates the passage of campylobacter through processing, based upon selection for certain genes. The model will simulate: how the strains change through processing the factors responsible for the survival and proliferation of disease points in processing where campylobacter can be most effectively eradicated In order to inform targeted interventions to reduce campylobacter, this project aims to identify the genetic elements and associated phenotypes that enable some chicken-associated genotypes to survive poultry processing and infect humans. A modelling approach based upon comparative functional genomics data will address fundamental questions about the genetic basis of genotypic variation. The work will be approached in three question areas. 1. Genome-wide association mapping will investigate: whether there are distinct gene pools associated with different stages of poultry processing are there lineages that are lost and others that proliferate are there particular micro-evolutionary events associated with survival whether such events occur in the core or the flexible genome 2. Campylobacter survival and spread will be modelled to determine: what factors are important in altering the genotypic/phenotypic diversity how population/gene-pool size, mutation and recombination rate, and growth rate influences survival/spread 3. Identification of targets for interventions by testing predictions: of how the enhanced fitness of adapted or adaptor lineages translate to in vivo systems. This will include examination of which functional categories of genes are most affected at each point through processing and which stages in processing are the best targets for reducing campylobacter"	"Chickens are the major source of human infection of campylobacter. Substantial evidence shows that strains associated with chicken are a major source of disease, thought to be because chickens have high levels of campylobacter contamination on the farm which is maintained through processing to retail. By considering the elimination of campylobacter on the farm, this project aims to develop interventions that are effective and practicable for the poultry industry to use. To achieve this, state-of-the-art means of determining the entire genetic code of campylobacter strains - from key stages through poultry processing and human disease - will be employed.

The quality of the test data using applied statistical methodologies will also be assessed and support will be provided, where required, for laboratories to improve performance. At least four sets of quality assurance determinations using standardised test samples of increasing complexity will be undertaken. Previous Agency-funded work using campylobacters on neck skins indicate that pipetting and stomaching are two aspects of testing that contribute disproportionately towards larger measurement errors. Selecting samples that require increasing amounts of processing (e.g. more pipetting, vortexing or stomaching) can provide clues that point to any disproportionately large sources of uncertainty when compared with previous measurements. Information will also be gathered that describes processing and other practices (e.g. overnight cleaning regimes) in chicken broiler slaughterhouses. Using multivariate analysis, this information will be used to identify those processing practices, if any, that have an influence on campylobacter numbers on post-chill broiler carcasses in UK plants. This will be achieved by developing a system based on the chicken broiler slaughterhouse assessment tool questions available from the Agency’s slaughterhouse hygiene tool (project FS241018)."

The availability of a validated rapid speciation test for monitoring purposes would make future campylobacter testing work more cost-effective while maintaining or increasing the quality of the test result. Therefore, in the first part of the monitoring programme this study will undertake both biochemical and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests in parallel for campylobacter speciation This will contribute to the standardisation, optimisation and validation of these techniques, allowing a significant reduction in cost of the tests for monitoring purposes if any of these tests are adopted in future. An industry voluntary monitoring programme currently uses samples that are taken for salmonella testing, comprising three neck skin samples per slaughter batch, five batches on one day with a frequency of once a week or less. It is not known how this sampling strategy compares with the sampling methodology used in the EU survey conducted in 2008, where sampling and testing of one neck and attached breast skin sample per slaughter batch was required. The project will also assess the performance of these two sampling strategies and determine how they compare for the enumeration of campylobacter in broiler batches. To improve the understanding of management practices within the UK broiler industry and to gain a better knowledge of their impact on the epidemiology of campylobacter in broiler flocks, data on production practices will be collected. Information on thinning and depopulation practices, flock size, general bio-security and other management practices will be collected using a questionnaire aimed at agriculture and farm managers of the participating companies. These data will be combined with the microbiological data generated by the monitoring programme and will be analysed independently.

Enrichment media to be included are Bolton, Preston, Exeter and mCCDA. The effect of pooling samples on the isolation rate will be examined. Pooling would significantly reduce the cost of testing a large number of samples. This is a particular problem when the flock prevalence is low, e.g. a 5% infection rate would require 59 samples to detect infection. The transportation of samples can have a significant effect on detection rates so factors such as time in transit, temperature and sample medium will investigated. At least four rapid detection methods will be compared initially using spiked samples. The most promising rapid methods will be subject to more detailed study using real samples."

"A recent review (FSA project ZB00023) of the current testing and scheduling practices used by the poultry industry revealed that over 95% of flocks were tested for salmonella but there were wide variations at all stages of the testing procedures. The authors concluded that because of the inadequacy of many industry practices it was certain that a significant number of salmonella positive flocks were not being detected, resulting in cross-contamination during slaughter. Testing and scheduling is an important salmonella control measure for poultry meat and there is an urgent need for clear and practical guidance on sampling and testing. Such guidance needs to clearly explain the best practical and economic procedures that industry should adopt to ensure the maximum number of salmonella positive flocks are detected.

Each was critically assessed for their respective strengths, weaknesses and their capacity to distinguish between infectious and non-infectious norovirus particles. The levels of norovirus detected in food by RT-PCR are lower than those in clinical samples and this was taken into account in assessing the different approaches and options.

"The conclusion of the Second Study of Infectious Intestinal Disease in the Community (IID2 Study) confirmed a high burden of intestinal viral disease in the UK, particularly that caused by norovirus. Person-to-person spread is a key transmission route for norovirus, although food contaminated at source, or by infected food handlers, is also frequently associated with outbreaks of disease and probably sporadic cases. There are significant gaps in our knowledge of how norovirus is able to survive and remain infectious in food, and on surfaces in kitchens. Current detection methods for norovirus use reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect and estimate the titre of norovirus present in food or environmental samples. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods are also available but are considered to be less sensitive. While the molecular methods are able to detect and in some cases quantify the amount of norovirus RNA present, they do not provide information on whether or not the detected virus is capable of causing human infection or the degree of any degradation/damage to the RNA or capsid. It is not possible to culture norovirus and other viruses (feline calicivirus, murine norovirus) tend to be used as surrogates for norovirus in in vitro studies. In the absence of human volunteer studies to assess infectivity, other approaches need to be explored to assist the interpretation of the findings from molecular-based testing of food and or the environment. It has been suggested that assessing the condition of the norovirus capsid might provide an indication of the degree of protection for norovirus RNA detected by RT-PCR. However, the applicability and practicality of this approach for food and environmental samples is likely to require further investigation."

"Human enteric viruses are a major cause of infectious intestinal disease (IID), with foodborne transmission thought to be an important route of infection.

Hepatitis A outbreaks have previously been reported; these have been associated with such foods as berry fruits (including strawberries), shellfish, vegetables and sun-dried tomatoes. Hepatitis E transmission has also been implicated in illness involving strawberries and shellfish, although hepatitis E is more commonly associated with undercooked pork meat and processed pork products (including figatellu; an uncooked or smoked pig liver sausage).

The results from ongoing sampling will allow the FSA and the food industry to see what impact they have had. It is expected that subsequent annual surveys will continue to monitor campylobacter prevalence and levels. It is hoped that a decrease in the numbers of the most heavily contaminated chickens (>1,000 cfu/g), will act to incentivise the retail and poultry industries to develop successful interventions with pace."

The campylobacter CAMP resistance system consists of a membrane-bound sensor protein and a small DNA binding protein which controls the expression of three genes encoding an inner membrane protein, an outer membrane anchored lipoprotein and a periplasmic protein, as well as certain disulphide bond (Dsb) genes and genes that are involved in peptide transport and metabolism. This is the project approach: investigate the mechanism of action of the lipoprotein and determine if it provides resistance to structurally diverse CAMPs determine the roles of the uncharacterised genes determine the role of the Dsb system in CAMP resistance investigate the connection between peptide transport and CAMP transport and degradation determine the importance of this system in vivo by chicken colonisation studies"	"Campylobacter is the most commonly reported bacterial cause of infectious intestinal disease in the UK and the leading cause of bacterial food poisoning. Poultry are a major source of infection through undercooked meat. In order to begin to control campylobacter infection in chickens, and reduce the risk of food poisoning, it is important to have a better understanding of how campylobacter interacts with both its chicken and human host. Cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPs) form a crucial defence against bacteria. CAMPs can be produced by the host, which insert themselves into the membrane of the bacteria to create a pore. The bacterial contents leak out of the pore which causes the death of the bacteria. However, campylobacter can be highly resistant to this action. This is because the bacterium uses a novel defence system, in the presence of these peptides, in which it positions a protein at its surface which binds the peptides and stops them getting to the cell membrane. This project aims to understand the details of how campylobacter is able to sense and respond to antimicrobial peptides, how the binding protein works and the role of some other proteins that are also controlled by this system."

The scoping stage consisted of a brief review of existing literature on the subject of consumer attitudes/understanding of food safety, food practices, production processes and treatment options. The review highlighted gaps and limitations in the existing literature and captured methodological insights that were used to inform the following research stages. Qualitative work in the form of two focus groups was used to inform survey question development. This helped to achieve an understanding of how different content, language and tonal decisions were likely to affect responses to the survey questions. Once the questionnaire was finalised a cognitive testing stage followed by a small pilot survey were undertaken to ensure the questions were clearly understood and the responses could be captured without any problems. The main stage survey involved face to face interviews with over 2000 respondents across the UK using a robust random probability design. The survey included collection of key demographic data. The survey response data was analysed to explore differences in views between different subgroups of the population and relationships between the data."	"The Agency has a strategic priority to reduce foodborne disease, tackling campylobacter in chicken as a priority. Identification and implementation of practical and effective interventions to reduce campylobacter in chicken is key to achieving this. Decontamination treatments applied to raw meat in the slaughterhouse could potentially have a significant effect in reducing the exposure of consumers to campylobacter and other foodborne pathogens. The FSA’s campylobacter citizens’ forums, held in 2010, gathered qualitative information on UK consumers’ awareness of campylobacter and their purchasing habits. It also looked at the acceptability of interventions to control campylobacter at farm, processing and retail level. The findings indicated further focused research was required in order to have a more robust, quantitative assessment of consumers’ attitudes towards potential slaughterhouse decontamination treatments for raw meat. This more detailed exploration of consumers’ attitudes will help inform the Agency's campylobacter risk management programme as well as discussions in Europe on permissible decontamination treatments for meat."

Over 10,000 citations relevant to viruses present in foods and the environment were screened using defined inclusion and exclusion criteria from which 126 citations were identified for further evaluation. Persistence data from each of these publications were extracted for the conditions of the treatment (chemical dose, pH, and temperature, time, infectivity, and Real-Time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) results). The only marker for hNoV persistence and survival is RTqPCR data and clinical studies. Therefore citations for inclusion were further restricted to only those that included hNoV RT-qPCR studies, in direct comparison with surrogate virus RT-qPCR and infectivity data; and also data from clinical trials. This resulted in 27 eligible laboratory-based studies and 3 clinical trials. Eligible studies were diverse and utilised different experimental approaches and methods. Few data were relevant to persistence and survival of hNoVs in real foods and on food contact surfaces. Data were further extracted for common treatments (heat and available chlorine) and for important additional experimental variables such as the matrix and RT-qPCR product size."	"Human NoVs are currently recognised as the single most common cause of acute non-bacterial gastroenteritis in the industrialised world. Genogroup II, genotype 4 (GII.4) strains of hNoV are detected most commonly in association with human disease, although there is a greater diversity of genotypes associated with foodborne outbreaks. Most hNoV foodborne disease outbreaks are associated with consumption of food outside of the home, where poor hygiene of infected food handlers is the major source of contamination. Contamination of fresh produce (eg berries, leafy greens) may be associated with human handling or the use of raw sewage or contaminated water during production or processing. Additionally, hNoV disease is highly contagious and shows rapid person-to-person transmission directly or indirectly through the faecal-oral route, from contaminated fomites and from aerosolized vomitus. Effective control measures for water treatment, food processing, cleaning and disinfection of surfaces, personal hygiene and hand washing, and/or sanitation are required in order to control the spread of hNoV along the food chain. However, the effectiveness of control measures to reduce the burden of foodborne norovirus infections remains largely unknown, partly because of the inability to grow the virus and partly due to the large number of surrogate studies of unknown relevance."

There has been a notable increase in reported human outbreaks of campylobacter in the UK in recent years. Most of these incidents have been associated with chicken liver pâté or parfait, prepared in catering settings. In 2011, over 90% of outbreaks of campylobacter food poisoning at catering venues were linked to chicken liver pâté consumption (HPA 2011). Strachan et al. (2012) have reported that strains of campylobacter from chicken liver were most similar to those found in humans. The reason for the recent increase is not fully understood but appears to be related to the use of undercooked livers in preparing pâté and parfait dishes. Campylobacter levels up to 10 4 cfu/g have been reported in uncooked chicken livers. Campylobacter spp. in poultry meat are known to be sensitive to freezing and this work has assessed the impact of freezing on the levels present in chicken livers. Freezing is a proven effective intervention to control campylobacter contamination of poultry meat. However, there has been a lack of evidence on how effective this treatment is with chicken livers, particularly under conditions similar to those in catering or domestic kitchens where freezer temperatures and freezing rates may vary."

All isolate genomes were then subjected to sequencing of paired-end libraries using the Illumina MiSeq platform. After this initial run, the genomes of a sub-set of isolates (approximately 25) were improved using a PacBio approach. Using this combination approach we constructed a comprehensive genome sequence data-set from the IID isolates, and these data were submitted to a publically accessible database. We also extracted and analysed MLST data from the IID isolates, in order to place the collection in the context of previous studies. Both MLST and genomic data were used to compare between the IID1 and IID2 collections. The major outcomes of the study were: a comprehensive genome sequence dataset from the IID isolates, submitted to a publically accessible database analysis of MLST data from the IID isolates to place the collection in the context of previous studies based on MLST genome-wide phylogenetic analysis of the IID strains compared to others available in the wider database (and our parallel studies involving isolates from the environment, wildlife and farm animals) In addition, we considerably enhanced the community’s knowledge on what constitutes the core genome of campylobacter, especially in relation to isolates associated with human infections, with the potential to link variations between strains (either in accessory genome content, or in SNP variations within the core genome) with other factors such as putative source or, potentially, clinical severity, as well as other important phenotypes, such as survival characteristics in the environment or during food processing."	"Campylobacter is the most common cause of acute bacterial gastroenteritis worldwide. In the UK alone it causes an estimated 500,000 infections each year. There have been two large studies of Infectious Intestinal Disease in the UK community (IID1 in the mid 1990s and IID2 in 2008-2009). Campylobacter was identified as the most common bacterial pathogen amongst patients presenting to primary care. Although there was little variation in the burden of illness between the two studies, the molecular epidemiology of the campylobacter isolates from these studies has not been investigated. MLST and (WGS) comparative analyses can be used to understand not only the epidemiology and any variations between the two survey periods, but also the potential sources for transmission of the pathogen to humans, by comparison with isolates from the environment, wildlife and farm animals."

"Norovirus is the most common cause of infectious diarrhoea and vomiting in the community. The virus can often cause outbreaks, especially in closed or semi-closed communities. As with other microorganisms that affect the gut, norovirus can be transmitted through: person-to-person transmission; from contaminated environments; eating food contaminated at source or by infected food handlers. What is not reliably known is exactly how much norovirus infection in the UK is foodborne as opposed to transmission by other means. Findings from international research groups have found that the proportion of norovirus transmitted through contaminated food varies quite widely. This project, through a series of linked studies, will aim to answer the following research questions: How much norovirus is transmitted through contaminated foods? What is the prevalence of norovirus contamination in outbreak and non-outbreak catering premises? Is it possible to differentiate between infectious and non-infectious norovirus in a variety of food matrices?"

The impact of adaptive immune responses to natural colonisation on phase variation of campylobacter genes was measured. Immune evasion was assessed by investigating whether the immune responses were associated with long-term colonisation impact on phase variation. Immune responses generated by a natural infection were investigated for their impact on colonisation or selection of phase variants. Models were used to determine whether observed changes in the proportions of phase variation are due to the drift associated with high phase variation rates, to non-selective bottlenecks or to selection of these variants. The impact of phase variation on protection by or avoidance of immune responses to whole-cell or sub-unit vaccines was examined by testing the hypothesis that campylobacter can escape vaccine-induced immune responses by phase variation of target antigens. Using vaccinated and non-vaccinated birds, a global view of the role of phase variants was obtained by examining the impact of whole-cell vaccine-induced immune responses on a selection of phase variants. To test whether phase variation of a single gene mediates immune evasion, further work examined the impact of immune responses induced by sub-unit vaccines. The impact of phase variation rates on the protection by, or avoidance of, immune responses to vaccines was examined. Phase locked-ON mutants of specific genes in vaccinated and non-vaccinated birds were used to investigate whether the loss of ability to undergo phase variation prevents immune evasion. Overall, these objectives significantly informed and furthered knowledge of the functions of phase variation of Campylobacter jejuni infections and are of relevance across the bacterial world where phase variation plays diverse and significant role in commensal and pathogenic behaviour."	"The control of campylobacter in poultry is predicted to significantly reduce human cases of infection, with vaccination being one of the routes used to achieve this. Current campylobacter vaccines have a variable efficacy in preventing colonisation in chickens. One reason given is that campylobacter induces the production of antibodies against its surface components. However, these antibodies do not prevent colonisation or clear the bacteria from birds. It is suggested that this is achieved by campylobacter switching off the expression of key surface molecules, so that they are not recognised by the chicken's antibodies, a process known as phase variation. This research investigated the effect of phase variation and its interplay with the immune responses of the host. This was achieved by testing the hypothesis that the induction and evasion of host immunity is correlated with phase-variable changes in surface structures of campylobacter. If true, it may be possible to improve the efficacy of campylobacter vaccines if the protective processes associated with phase variation are by-passed."

Before use, all recipes were assessed by scoring the Provenance, Relevance, Objectivity, Method, Presentation and Timeliness of each between 0 and 5 for each attribute. Acceptably-scored recipes were scrutinised as a means of identifying any practices that were likely to be beneficial in reducing the numbers of campylobacters contaminating livers. From assessment of these recipes a protocol was developed from the identified likely beneficial manufacturing stages and ingredients. Approach 2: Pilot scale assessment of the pâté recipe Using contaminated livers, the recipe was trialled and a batch of pâté was manufactured with rigorous monitoring of the cooking temperature. The pâté was stored under refrigeration and a portion tested (ISO 10272-2) to confirm that the effective cooking had destroyed the campylobacters. The pilot batch of pâté was subjected to an initial round of assessment by a trained test panel to determine if the recipe generated a palatable pâté. Approach 3: Determination of the contribution of each antimicrobial pâté: manufacture stage This study proposed five campylobacter interventions of freezing livers, organic acid wash, exposure to essential oils in herbs in a marinade, a flambé in brandy and heat treatment to 70oC. The effect of freezing raw livers is already known (Harrison et al 2013). The relative impacts of organic acid immersion, a herbal milk marinade, flambé and effective cooking on Campylobacter populations was measured. Three different batches of livers were washed in organic acid and marinated with different batches of herbs under refrigeration and the numbers of campylobacters determined before and after each treatment. The marinated livers were further processed into pâté with numbers of campylobacters determined before and after flambé and the cooking of the livers. Replication was as described in the microbiological testing section. Approach 4: A comparison of the sensory characteristics of pâté manufactured from fresh and frozen livers A blind taste comparison was made of two parfaits prepared from a single batch of livers, half of which were frozen overnight; with the other half being chilled overnight. The trial also assessed the sensory characteristics of the parfait (texture, juiciness, taste, colour). At the end of the trial, a statistical analyses report was generated to indicate any significant differences between the treatments and rank the samples based on user-stipulated attributes."	"In 2010, there were more outbreaks of campylobacter than salmonella and most of these were associated with chicken liver pâté/parfait dishes served in catering settings. In the absence of clear evidence-based advice to caterers and consumers on safe preparation of organoleptically acceptable products (this means that the products are acceptable in terms of taste, appearance, small and touch), outbreaks are likely to continue with associated public health and economic costs. This research has the potential to identify safer preparation steps which could form the basis of advice to consumers and caterers on preparing these products. The work is not seen as a replacement for good hygienic practice or the application of HACCP principles which are the responsibility of food businesses."

"Consumers expect that the meat they purchase will be safe to eat. Whilst adequate cooking will kill harmful bacteria that could be present on meat, if products are mishandled, such bacteria can potentially infect individuals who prepare the food or others indirectly via contaminated surfaces or other food products that become contaminated. In recent years, there has been considerable concern about the bacteria Escherichia coli (E. coli) with a certain type of antibiotic resistance profile being present in farm animals such as cattle, chickens, pigs and turkeys. Such bacteria can sometimes subsequently be found in some meat, particularly chicken meat. This type of antibiotic resistance primarily under investigation in this study is caused by enzymes called extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), which confer resistance to a group of antibiotics known as the cephalosporins, which are important antibiotics used to treat human infections. Whilst many strains of E. coli bacteria live harmlessly in the intestines of most mammals, some strains can cause mild to serious diseases in humans (for example gastro-enteritis, urinary tract infections and systemic infections of the blood and internal organs). If the E.coli strains are resistant to antibiotics the infections become more difficult to treat effectively, and the bacteria can be considered more dangerous. Whilst there have been many studies that have investigated the presence of ESBL-positive bacteria in meat, the methods used in these studies have varied, although there have been some common aspects. Also, to date, there has been a lack of data to validate the sensitivity of the methods used. For example, will such tests be able to detect low numbers of ESBL-producing bacteria from meats, when there might be lots of other bacteria present that could confuse the results? To this end, the purpose of this study was to develop and validate methods, including a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay, to isolate ESBL-producing bacteria from meats using different agars and to detect ESBL-producing bacteria from meats using genetic methods."

Hospitals and healthcare establishments can be very complex operations, and the guidance produced by this project will detail appropriate controls, critical limits, targets, monitoring and corrective actions which should be implemented in healthcare settings. Inadequate controls within manufacturing premises can result in contamination of finished products and ingredients with listeria. Inadequate control of the distribution chain in respect of temperature control and/or stock rotation can result in conditions that support the growth of Listeria monocytogenes.

(Currently this is only available for England and Wales.) The IID2 study extension aimed to estimate the burden of UK-acquired foodborne disease in 2009, when the IID2 study was carried out, and to quantify the contribution of different pathogens and various food commodities to total foodborne disease burden. To meet the first objective, a model was developed to estimate the number of cases, general practice (GP) consultations and hospital admissions of indigenous foodborne disease, due to the major enteric pathogens. Several different data sources were used to obtain information on model parameters and their associated uncertainty. Data on pathogen-specific rates of disease were obtained from the IID1 and IID2 studies. Data were also used from reported outbreaks in the UK and the published literature, obtained from a systematic review that was conducted to inform estimates of the proportion of IID cases attributable to foodborne transmission. The IID1 and IID2 studies and outbreak data also provided information on pathogen-specific hospitalisation rates. Information on these parameters was incorporated into models to estimate pathogen-specific numbers of cases, GP consultations and hospital admissions in 2009. Two modelling approaches were used: a Monte Carlo simulation, which is the standard method as used by several research groups worldwide, and a Bayesian approach, which is novel in this field. Three modelling simulations were generated – one using Monte Carlo and two using Bayesian methods. To meet the second objective, the food attribution model was extended to estimate: the number of cases, GP consultations and hospital admissions attributable to different food commodities. Information on the proportion of cases attributable to different pathogens and food commodities was obtained from an analysis of UK outbreak surveillance data and published food attribution studies. Twelve food commodity groups were used. These were seafood, dairy, eggs, red meat, game, beef and lamb, pork, poultry, grains and beans, oils and sugars, produce, complex and other foods."	"Many cases of food poisoning go undetected or unreported. For a number of years the FSA has drawn on the infectious intestinal disease (IID) study and related work by Public Health England to estimate and monitor the burden of foodborne disease, based on the number of laboratory confirmed cases. The original IID study (IID1) was carried out in the mid 1990s, and was the first of its kind to estimate the total number of cases of infectious intestinal disease (diarrhoea and vomiting) in England (both food and non-food related). More recently, a second infectious intestinal disease study (IID2) updated this work, and looked at the UK as a whole. The IID2 study, which was published in 2011, was designed to estimate the overall rate of IID in the UK in 2009, to assess whether the overall level of IID had changed since the original study, as well as determining estimated rates for individual pathogens."

The hypothesis on which the work plan was based is that some campylobacter strains and some campylobacter reservoirs are much more important than others in this process. The study determined the relative importance and the interaction of each strain/reservoir to identify the sources of campylobacter, this was then used to establish the extent that other animals in the vicinity of the broiler house could pose a risk for broiler colonisation. The study also identified which intervention strategies would be best in reducing the risk of colonisation. The project had three main work areas: The dose response of eight different campylobacter strains in broilers was determined by looking at chicken to chicken colonisation efficacy of different campylobacter strains. Once this had been achieved the work went on to investigate the efficacy of chicken colonisation from campylobacter strains originating from cattle, sheep and pigeons. Competitive colonisation and competitive exclusion between the different strains was examined with the data finally used to develop a mathematical dose response model which incorporated the complex interactions of strains. The survival of different campylobacter strains in key environmental matrices were determined. Survival studies were performed in a range of matrices associated with the broiler environment, including faeces from cattle, sheep, pigeons and chickens, loam soil, water and chicken litter waste. Faeces from cattle, sheep and chicken were naturally contaminated whilst soil and water were spiked. A range of models were applied to investigate survival and test the goodness of fit for each method. Using this method the time for a single log reduction in campylobacter was estimated and compared with each of the different strains and matrices. The relative importance of the sources causing campylobacter infection in broiler farms was investigated and strategies to mitigate these risks developed. To achieve this, a transmission model was developed to simulate the flow of campylobacter from animal sources. This was developed in stages starting with a single strain of campylobacter, single source animal and a single broiler house. Using these models the relative risk of infection by animal source and strain was determined. Finally, intervention simulations were performed using the models. Amongst others, these investigated the effect of the removal of certain farm animals from the environment, restriction of access to poultry and the reduction of wild birds in the vicinity of the broiler house."	"Studies have shown that the main causes of human campylobacter infection is from eating improperly cooked meat or because of cross-contamination to uncooked foods. To reduce the burden of human infection, it is believed that informed biosecurity interventions on broiler farms are most likely to achieve a reduction in campylobacter in poultry. This project investigated and developed a number of novel biosecurity controls on high throughput broiler production. Previous studies of the sources of campylobacter infection in humans identified the principle source as broiler chickens. It has also been shown that strains found in humans, chickens, cattle, sheep, wild birds, pigs were quite distinct with some strains common to several hosts. This study aimed to better understand the relative importance of the potential sources of campylobacter in broilers by using a modelling approach. By quantifying their relative importance and interaction, it was hoped that the source of campylobacter in the broiler house could be identified. This information will be used to inform and introduce effective measures to prevent colonisation of these birds. Further, the findings will enable policy to be developed to define which control measures are the most effective."

By assessing strain diversity and constructing epidemiological models to estimate their impacts on possible interventions, this project sought to assess whether practical interventions can be implemented to reduce the levels of campylobacter before meats reach the kitchen. This project sampled all stages of broiler chicken production from farm to retail in order to determine the incidence, level and type of campylobacter colonisation of chicken, and carcass contamination, in commercial poultry production. Strain diversity was addressed using a combination of molecular and traditional culture methods on chickens: on farm pre- and post-thinning upon transport at slaughter during processing on the final carcass This provided data that was used to construct epidemiological models to estimate the impact of implementing multiple interventions on campylobacter population levels and diversity. The five operational objectives were: Establish methods to reliably enumerate and capture strain diversity of campylobacters in commercial poultry production, both on farm and during processing. This was achieved by the enumeration and discrimination of strain diversity with enumeration performed using modified Cefoperazone Charcol Desoxycholate Agar and discrimination by DNA colony hybridization. Establish a baseline for the survival and transfer of campylobacter types on carcasses from colonised flocks. To achieve this: firstly the baseline prevalence and diversity in broiler chicken flocks was determined. Flocks were monitored by examining how means and variances varied over time, including the impact of different seasons, and the distribution of strain diversity across the samples. secondly the degree of process contamination from campylobacter positive flocks was estimated. campylobacter populations were estimated from the caecal contents of chickens. Similarly viable campylobacter populations were estimated from carcass samples from positive flocks post slaughter and samples collected from the chicken processing plant. The efficacy of the disinfectant used throughout the cleaning regimes was tested. thirdly the survival and transfer of campylobacters on carcasses was investigated. Neck skin samples were taken from selected processing stages as these have been shown to harbour campylobacters. assess the efficacy of on-farm biosecurity interventions in terms of Campylobacter prevalence, colonisation and strain diversity. A comparison of on-farm interventions will be made. The proposed interventions have to be permissible and commercially feasible and will be measured against current production standards in terms of productivity and flock health. Assess how process changes affect contamination of chicken meat by campylobacters. A comparison was made of post-harvest interventions. Use mathematical models to assess the causes and consequences of campylobacter strain diversity and turnover, both on farm and during processing. A multi-strain model was developed with rapid clearance and re-infection, which captured both the dynamics of dominant strains and the statistical distribution of multiple low prevalence subtypes. Statistical data analysis of strain diversity, strain turnover, and intervention efficacy was made as part of the empirical work packages. The outputs were used to assess the effectiveness of various interventions in reducing human exposure to campylobacter."

However, there was also the opportunity to carry out bioinformatics analyses of listeria data. The listeria species Fera sequenced have been selected as a wide reference set for the bioinformatics studies on genomic comparisons. Listeria innocua was the most frequently encountered non-pathogenic listeria and is sufficiently distantly related to other species including Listeria monocytogenes to be used as an out group in the later phylogenetic analysis of the sequenced genomes. Listeria seeligeri is found as a contaminant of soft cheese and processed meat and Listeria welshimeri which is a non-pathogenic listeria found in soil, water, food, and sewage was also sequenced. The non-monocytogenes were chosen to have a diverse collection of isolates to perform a comprehensive wide comparative genomic analysis. Fera used the in-house isolates for two reasons: Fera has the isolates on site so could get the sequence data rapidly, in time to complete some bioinformatics analysis of the genomes for the GMI meeting in September 2013. The isolates represent the diversity of listeria circulating in the retail supply chain across the UK – the sampling was extremely widespread both geographically and across different meats. The isolates are not the most current isolates. This helped to address the question of what temporal variability there is amongst listeria strains."	"This pilot project aimed to show that whole bacterial genome sequencing, to a draft quality using next generation DNA sequencing (NGS) platforms such as Illumina MiSeq, could be used for comparative genomics. This will help our understanding of foodborne bacterial pathogens from both a biological perspective, and to help microbial source tracking and identify relationships between strains. The aim was also to contribute sequencing data to an international initiative – the Global Microbial Identifier (GMI) – as part of a wider GMI pilot study gathering listeria data from international participants from the food safety and public health sectors. Isolates originating from the FSA red meat survey were sequenced as part of Fera’s collection of Listeria monocytogenes from the red meat study strains. Other closely related listeria species, namely Listeria innocua, Listeria seeligeri and Listeria welshimeri, were also sequenced. The project involved bioinformatics comparative genomics analysis."

The project followed six main stages: interviews with a number of norovirus experts to conceptualise the model and obtain an initial understanding of parameter values.  creation of a first-cut model based on information gathered in the interviews. additional expert consultations, as necessary, to obtain further parameter values. completion of model formulation and parameterisation. model analysis - extraction of indicative findings on relative importance that food plays in norovirus transmission; identification of gaps in knowledge about parameter values; recommendations for further work. creation of a report on modelling work and summary presentation of study. The model has been transferred to the FSA’s Operational Research Unit for further in-house development as necessary."	"Norovirus is one of the major sources of Infectious Intestinal Disease (IID) in the UK with about 2.8 million estimated cases in 2009.  Like many enteric viruses, there are a number of different routes of infection that are thought to be significant in the spread of norovirus, which is easily passed from person to person. Other routes include contaminated foods, such as shellfish and fresh produce and infected food handlers. The relative importance of these different routes for norovirus transmission is not well understood, nor is the way in which they interact with each other. This makes it difficult to target efforts on developing effective interventions that will reduce the number of cases.  In particular, the relative importance of infection from contaminated food is uncertain, particularly given the frequent occurrence of transmission from person to person. Understanding this will help inform whether interventions directed at the food chain are likely to have significant impacts on reducing overall numbers of cases of norovirus."

Independent farmers will be asked to register online and complete a short questionnaire, which includes farm details and the number of sheds. Sampling kits will then be issued directly to the farmer together with instructions on how to collect the sample . The farmer can then post this sample off to the laboratory, with the result received by text message within 72 hours. The samples will be processed using the technique real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The farmer will have the opportunity to compare their results to the national average by logging on to the web-based platform. The data collected will be used to establish if there is a pattern or link between negative test results and what is happening on-farm (for example whether there may be a link with litter quality, the use of antibiotics or a known stress event during the growing of the birds). At the end of the project the results and conclusions of the data analysis will be made available to the industry on an anonymous basis and will hopefully provide answers, or at least clues, to tackling this issue for the industry."	"This project is being carried out as part of the FSA’s overarching Campylobacter programme. The independent broiler chicken farming sector has previously not been involved in such a testing provision and therefore this was seen as an excellent opportunity to allow farmers within this sector to monitor their flocks for campylobacter. This will also allow farmers the chance to make some improvements (for example implement biosecurity) if they receive positive test results. An added incentive is that the sampling kits are free and all results obtained from the scheme will be reported anonymously."

This helped identify intervention strategies that can be used in the industry to reduce human health risks. The work plan was split into these five areas: Historical data Data from commercial producers on flock performance, condemnation and flock health was collected to analyse special-temporal patterns of disease across farms and production cycles. The results formed the basis for more detailed longitudinal field experiments. Field research The temporal dynamics of campylobacter colonisation and its extra-intestinal spread were investigated allowing the quantification of the effects of bird welfare, endemic disease and in-house environment of the bacteria. Three fundamental hypotheses were investigated: broiler production systems and the environment they are kept affects bird welfare, which in turn determines the susceptibility of birds to campylobacter colonisation broiler production systems influence the impact of endemic disease, which in turn impacts on the colonisation and extra-intestinal spread of campylobacter in birds bird growth rate in different broiler genotypes is more important than underlying genotype in determining susceptibility to campylobacter and endemic disease Outputs from this part of the study provided parameter estimates for the modelling of interventions to reduce campylobacter and avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) infection. Laboratory studies Studies were performed to investigate whether infection with APEC increases a bird’s susceptibility to campylobacter and that this duel infection leads to extra-intestinal spread. Work investigated four hypotheses: campylobacter colonises the gut of rapidly growing birds more easily than those growing more slowly. APEC colonises the gut of rapidly growing birds more easily than those growing more slowly and is more likely to spread from the gut. In vivo behaviour of campylobacter will differ in birds that are also infected with APEC. In birds infected with APEC, campylobacter colonises with a lower infectious dose. Statistical modelling: Data obtained from the studies was used to identify risk factors for campylobacter colonisation and extra-intestinal spread. Mixed effect modelling was then used to quantify the dynamics of colonisation and spread, the addition of event modelling allowed the identification of risk factors, and finally structural equation modelling analysed the role of indirect and direct drivers in these processes. Process-based epidemiological models Epidemiological models were developed to identify practical options to mitigate campylobacter infection and extra intestinal spread in production. The dynamics of changes in immunology, gut pathology and the presence in different body tissues, namely caecum and liver, was quantified. The outputs from this were used to parameterise further process-based modelling. This enabled the investigation of different intervention strategies for minimising colonisation and spread of campylobacter."	"This project provided inputs into the FSA’s work not only to reduce the risk to human health from campylobacter, but also in meeting future EU targets aimed at reducing the number of campylobacter-positive chickens. The study focused on intensively reared chicken which comprises approximately 90% of the UK market, and investigated the major routes of contamination including carcass surface cross-contamination and potential infectivity from the muscle and liver of chickens. The study included field studies and investigated whether the environment in which chickens are bred affects the incidence of campylobacter. This was related to the health and welfare of the birds. Different intensive systems were studied and reasons for the observed differences in campylobacter status investigated, this was combined with modelling and molecular approaches to investigate factors that improve resistance to campylobacter, reduce risk of colonisation and the intra-intestinal spread in UK broilers. The implications of these results were discussed in terms of reducing human health risks and the incidence of campylobacter by modellers, microbiologists, molecular biologists, retailers and poultry producers."

The risk assessment was to follow the main steps of the Codex risk assessment framework (CAC, 1999), which is most commonly used for food safety risk assessments. Using the Codex framework, a risk assessment is split into the following components; Hazard identification, exposure assessment, hazard characterisation and risk characterisation. However, during the hazard identification stage of the risk assessment it became clear that there were significant data gaps in the level of knowledge of C. burnetii. In particular there was little or no information on: levels and viability of C. burnetii in sheep and goats’ milk survival of C. burnetii in unpasteurised milk and milk products survival and fate of C. burnetii during the cheese-making processes and manufacture of other milk products dose-response data for humans through the oral route current farm prevalence and within herd/flock prevalence of C. burnetii (ELISA and PCR data are available but will overestimate the prevalence); and Qualitative or quantitative studies on consumption patterns of unpasteurised milk and milk products Those data gaps in part reflect the difficulties in routine culture of C. burnetii and also the lack of data on the viability of the organisms when DNA is detected by PCR methods. It was therefore agreed that an alternative approach was required as there were insufficient data for a full quantitative or qualitative risk assessment. Overall, the revised work programme included four deliverables: the hazard identification the development of a risk profile for C. burnetii through consumption of unpasteurised milk and milk products the identification of the risk pathways to humans through consumption of unpasteurised milk and unpasteurised cheeses; and the development of an exposure assessment model, together with a sensitivity analysis, for humans consuming unpasteurised cows’ milk Of additional interest was the risk to humans due to consumption of unpasteurised milk/milk products during an abortion storm* at a goat farm. In the absence of sufficient data for goats, a scenario analysis was undertaken for cows’ milk to represent an outbreak within a cattle herd. The risk assessment was reviewed by the Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food (ACMSF meeting of 27/6/13). See: ACMSF website *A large number of abortions typically caused by infectious disease"	"Q fever is a widespread zoonotic disease caused by the bacterium Coxiella burnetii and is present in cattle, sheep and goats. In most cases clinical illness is not seen, but occasional large outbreaks or clinical cases of Q fever are reported in animals. The clinical manifestations of Q fever in humans are variable, ranging from asymptomatic to serious. The main route of transmission to humans is via the inhalation of aerosols from the parturient (birth) products of infected animals. It is known that meat, milk and milk products can be contaminated. However, the link to clinical disease in humans is unclear. The original aim of this work was to undertake a quantitative risk assessment for C. burnetii in unpasteurised milk and milk products from UK cattle, goats and sheep. However, in part due to the problems in culturing this pathogen, much of the data required for the risk assessment are missing. It was therefore agreed with the Food Standards Agency to develop a risk profile for C. burnetii through unpasteurised milk and milk products and, instead of developing a full risk assessment, to conduct an exposure assessment for consumption of unpasteurised cows’ milk. This will allow the FSA to make consistent, evidence-based risk management decisions in relation to Q fever risks from unpasteurised milk and milk products."

These data will be used to refine the study hypotheses for field studies to be carried out in the natural and farm environments, examining human behaviour, human-environment interactions and campylobacter ecology. The data obtained from these field studies will be examined by mathematical modelling to investigate the burden of disease and seasonal patterns in the light of various environmental/social changes."	"Many organisms that cause diarrhoeal disease are widely distributed in the environment with several different pathways leading to human disease. Most research into diarrhoeal disease to date has been largely biomedical and focussed on transmission through contaminated food or water, however, fundamental gaps in our knowledge remain. This project aims to fill these gaps by looking at the contributions to disease caused by human behaviour and human-environment interactions which may influence exposure to organisms and risk of disease. Campylobacter is the most common bacterial cause of diarrhoeal disease in the developed world. The transmission pathways for approximately 50% of human cases remain unknown. Seasonal dynamics do however, play a central role in the disease burden as about 40% of cases occur during a ‘spring peak’, yet the relative roles of environmental and food pathways, and their interaction, in this seasonal emergence are poorly understood."

This research will be the first such study attempting to quantify numbers of ESBL-producing E.coli and will cover a greater variety and number of foodstuffs than previous work, including fresh produce which has been relatively unexplored. Phenotypic and genotypic analyses will be carried out for antimicrobial resistant (AMR) E. coli isolated from retail meat and fresh produce. Phenotypic selection for the presence/absence of AMR will be determined for ESBLs, AmpC or carbapenem resistant organisms on three different chromogenic agars (CHROMagar ESBL, CHROMagar CTX and CHROMagar KPC), plus a cefoxitin-containing plate to select for AmpC producers. Molecular characterisation will be performed on 300 isolates for each commodity group of meat and fresh produce (n=600) by PCR and/or sequencing for ESBL (CTX-M, OXA, SHV and TEM) and acquired AmpC (CMY-2) genes. This research package will determine the main ESBL types at gene family level which are present in foodborne E.coli isolates. Molecular characterisation between ESBL-positive isolates from the defined sources will be compared to identify the most significant reservoirs of ESBL-producing E.coli strains likely to cause diseases in people in the UK. * The FSA contributed financially to incorporating fresh produce into the full research project."	"  Inections caused by multi-drug resistant bacteria, such as MRSA and ESBL-producing E.coli are a public health concern and these organisms have been detected in food-producing animals and fresh produce in several countries, although not in fresh produce in the UK. There is growing concern relating to transmission of these organisms along the food chain through to final food products. Of particular concern is the potential for amplification and spread of antimicrobial resistance by cycling through animal reservoirs. The Department of Health (DH) has funded a three-year project ‘ Defining reservoirs of ESBL E.coli and the threat posed to personal, animal and public health in the UK’. The FSA contributed financially to expand the scale and scope of research activities. The analysis of 400 meat samples and 400 fresh produce (fruit and vegetables) has been carried out by Public Health England (PHE) and Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency (AHVLA), and will constitute the largest study of its kind in the UK."

"Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) are enzymes that can be produced by bacteria. The enzymes make the bacteria resistant to the beta-lactam class of antibiotics known as cephalosporins, which are widely used in hospitals. ESBL genes are frequently plasmid encoded, making them more easily transferable to the bacterial chromosome, other plasmids and other bacteria. The Agency is considering the possibility that ESBL resistant bacteria could be transmitted to foodborne pathogens, via the food chain to humans. If this was to occur these infections would be difficult to treat. This study investigates the zoonotic aspects of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) positive commensal E. coli strains and their mobile genetic elements in food-producing animals, and animal products as a source for introduction of these enzymes into food-borne pathogens, commensals and pathogens in the community and healthcare settings in Europe.

"The public health impact of gastrointestinal infection was underlined by the publication of the IID (Infectious Intestinal Disease) Study in England by the Food Standards Agency in 2000. As well as defining disease burden, a major component of the IID study was calibration of national surveillance systems, in other words, estimation of the factor by which the number of cases of infection with specified pathogens needed to be multiplied to establish the actual number of infections in the community. The FSA's foodborne disease reduction target has been a major Government public health initiative. Progress is measured using laboratory surveillance data for five key pathogens: salmonellas, campylobacters, Clostridium perfringens , Escherichia coli O157 and Listeria monocytogenes . However, to reflect on recent figures and to measure future progress, the FSA will need to know whether or not the relationship between disease burden in the community and official statistics is similar to the situation over a decade ago. Since the original IID Study was undertaken in the mid 1990s, several structural changes have occurred in national surveillance and these might have altered that relationship to a greater or lesser degree. Therefore, contemporary information on the relationships in the reporting pyramid is required. To determine this information, a second IID study was commissioned by the FSA and was undertaken by the University of Manchester in collaboration with the Health Protection Agency (Centre for Infections and Local and Regional Services), Medical Research Council General Practice Research Framework, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, University of East Anglia, University of Nottingham, Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre Northern Ireland, National Public Health Service in Wales, Health Protection Scotland and NHS Direct. The main aims of this study were: to estimate prospectively the burden and causes of IID in the population and presenting to general practitioners in the UK and to compare these results with national surveillance data to estimate the burden of self-reported IID in each UK nation via a telephone survey and to compare these results with the prospective estimate"	"University of Manchester"	"-1"	"65"	"Institution not in the DB; please collect information manually and populate in institution_data table."

Previous surveys of retail cold sliced meats with particular reference to L. monocytogenes have been based on market share with the majority of samples being collected from large retailers. A Health Protection Agency (now known as Public Health England) study of human listeriosis in England found that high risk groups, such as the elderly, were more likely to buy foods from smaller convenience stores than the general population therefore this survey focused on SME retailers. In total, 1,046 samples were tested for L. monocytogenes and other Listeria spp. (detection and enumeration). Samples were also tested for the hygiene indicator organisms Escherichia coli and enterobacteriaceae (detection and enumeration), physical and chemical characteristics such as salt content, water activity and pH. The storage temperatures in the SMEs at the time of sampling were recorded, as will a range of factors such as price, retailer and store address, product type, use-by date and storage instructions. A statistical comparison with earlier studies was carried with findings summarised in a final report on completion of the survey. This survey is intended to be a focused survey to determine prevalence of contamination in different ready-to-eat sliced meats to provide an indication of potential underlying risk factors associated with these products on sale in SMEs. It is not intended that this survey will investigate seasonality."	"Listeria monocytogenes has been identified by the FSA as one of the key pathogens for priority action, because infections with this organism (listeriosis) are associated with a high rate of mortality. It is therefore important that sources of exposure to this organism are pinpointed and factors contributing to infections identified. The types of food in which listeria can be found are diverse and there are several key foods which have been implicated in the transmission of listeriosis, including cooked sliced meats."

To validate the results from the field study, PCR-based methods were used to test stored samples for DNA specific for salmonella and yersinia, rather than repeat the same culture-based tests which were completed on the original samples. This was done to re-determine the presence/absence of salmonella and yersinia using a different method of measurement (PCR as opposed to culture). The following approach was taken: identification of yersinia isolated in project FS145003 determination of the presence or absence of yersinia and salmonella DNA in frozen samples, archived from project FS145003, using PCR testing and analysis comparison of the molecular testing results with the traditional culture results from project FS145003"	"Traditional post mortem inspection includes palpation and incision, which can potentially increase the risk of contamination, while visual-only post mortem inspection reduces handling of the carcass. In previous work entitled ‘A trial of visual inspection of fattening pigs from non-controlled housing conditions’, the frequency and types of conditions that could be identified at slaughter by the two different meat inspection methods was investigated. This was to see if there was a difference between the two methods that might lead to a change in risk to human health/animal health/animal welfare, if the inspection method was changed for pigs reared outdoors. Traditional microbiological techniques isolated 12 yersinia species and no salmonella species. No statistical difference was found in the proportion of carcasses contaminated with Yersinia spp. The low numbers of bacteria found (ie the microbiological outcomes) were not unexpected, given that the abattoir had an extremely high level of hygiene. Low levels of total aerobic and coliform bacterial counts were also obtained.

We have previously used MS to accurately determine mass profiles for prion proteins characteristic for various transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) in sheep. Different prion protein treatment methods were evaluated for this purpose and the most effective approach applied to differentiate the prions associated with various sheep TSEs. Marked differences were identified between prions from sheep BSE and those from classical scrapie and between other known sheep TSEs, thereby validating this approach as a means of TSE-strain specific characterisation. The prion protein naturally occurs in a number of modified states in mammalian tissue, called glycoforms. Using low resolution profiling, scientists have found that the relative presence of these glycoforms can give additional differentiation between the various cattle BSE types, but again, these can be difficult to determine accurately. We propose to develop a mass spectrometry based method to also quantify these glycoforms. The high resolution method based on both the protein mass profile and accurate determination of the protein modification profile planned here is expected to provide superior differentiation between BSE types from cattle. Once the mass and modification profiling method for BSEs is available, it can be applied to diagnose and classify any new cases of BSE in cattle and facilitate subsequent research into what happens after transmission of these types of BSE, whether into sheep or cattle. This will allow us to compile a dossier of data for submission to the EURL Strain Typing Expert group for endorsement into statutory UK and EU TSE surveillance methodologies and aid monitoring and investigation of the zoonotic potentials of these TSEs."	"Throughout the BSE epidemic, BSE cases in cattle have shown consistent properties. However, after the main epidemic, 63 cases have been identified with different characteristics across Europe and elsewhere. These are now known to correspond to distinct forms of BSE, but are sometimes difficult to differentiate from regular BSE. As yet the human health risks associated with these BSEs are unclear. Sensitive differential diagnosis of the different types of BSE is very important both for the management of disease in humans and livestock and in providing confidence in the safety of the food chain. The disease is associated with accumulation of misfolded prion protein (PrPSc) and detection of this marker protein is central to diagnosis. It is known that different BSEs correspond to a slightly different mass, or more specifically mass profile, of these misfolded prion proteins after a specific laboratory treatment. Currently available techniques to determine these mass profiles have a relatively low resolution. It is particularly difficult to determine the difference for prion proteins associated with different types of BSEs."

The approach involved obtaining and interpreting information from scientific literature, which described the microbiological status of the meat products at various stages of the production process. Data and information on the microbiological status of the products was also gathered from industry food business operators using surveys. An assessment and comparison of the microbiological risks associated with the different production stages was implemented. Commentary was provided on the appropriateness of the required controls and restrictions for each stage of meat product production, and any required changes/improvements were suggested. Finally, the identification of information gaps was carried out."	"Mechanically separated meat (MSM) is obtained by removing meat from flesh-bearing bones, after boning or from poultry carcases. This is done using mechanical means and results in the loss/modification of muscle fibre structure. Desinewed meat (DSM) is produced from the mechanical removal of sinew and tendons from meat, which has been separated from animal bones. This is done using a low pressure mechanical technique, either as part of a continuous or a separate process. Since April 2012, the term ‘desinewed meat’ is no longer used as the European Commission had advised that DSM produced by mechanically separating residual meat from animal bones must now be regarded as MSM. Techniques that do not alter the structure of the bones produce a product called Type 1 MSM where the calcium content is not significantly higher than that of minced meat. All other processes produce a product called Type 2 MSM. Some processes which produce DSM are classified as MSM Type 1, and some as meat preparations. Meat preparations are defined by the legislation as “fresh meat, including meat that has been reduced to fragments, which has had foodstuffs, seasonings or additives added to it or which has undergone processes insufficient to modify the internal muscle fibre structure of the meat and thus to eliminate the characteristics of fresh meat”. There are currently restrictions on the use of MSM and DSM from poultry and pork (please see the FSA website - http://food.gov.uk/business-industry/guidancenotes/meatregsguid/dsm-guid... ). This research project was carried out in order to support the FSA’s assessment of whether these restrictions are both proportionate and appropriate, with regards to public health protection."

Importantly, it is also known that hosts with mixed infections displaying a single pathology can harbour low levels of a distinct strain which can emerge upon further passage. There are limited studies on mixed infections with BSE and scrapie, however within a mouse model this scenario led to the presentation of a scrapie-associated pathology, even when the inoculum had much greater levels of BSE agent compared to scrapie agent. Together, data suggests that similar mixed infections of sheep or goats may present as scrapie even though the BSE agent is present. An in vitro prion amplification assay will be applied to the detection of very low levels of BSE agent in the presence of an excess of scrapie agent. The contractor has previously demonstrated that this assay is exquisitely sensitive for the BSE agent and does not amplify any scrapie agents. The aim of this study is to establish this novel amplification-assay for the detection of BSE in the presence of scrapie agent and to compare this method with conventional BSE tests applied in routine surveillance. The aim is to provide a novel, high sensitivity assay to monitor for the presence of very low levels of BSE in small ruminants, even with concurrent scrapie infections. It will help to inform policy as to the potential risk of BSE agent being present in sheep or goats but not being detected when measured by conventional assays."	"Prion diseases are fatal brain diseases with no effective treatment.  Until the emergence of BSE in the mid-1980s it was thought that any given prion disease had a very limited natural host range. For example, scrapie affecting sheep/goats and Creutzfeldt Jakob disease (CJD) affecting humans. However, the BSE agent not only affected cattle, but was also the causal agent of feline spongiform encephalopathy and human variant CJD (vCJD), both arising from the consumption of BSE contaminated bovine products. BSE-contaminated bovine-derived meat and bone meal was extensively fed not only to cows, giving rise to the UK cattle BSE epidemic, but also to small ruminants. Yet extensive surveillance has failed to uncover BSE infections in sheep populations throughout Europe, including the UK. This is surprising given that sheep are susceptible to BSE when fed the agent under experimental conditions. Two cases of BSE infections have been identified in goats. The UK small ruminant population has had endemic scrapie and whilst the incidence of this disease has been significantly reduced, it is estimated that approximately 67,000 scrapie infected animals still enter the human food chain each year. One concern is that low levels of BSE cases may be harboured within the small ruminant population and be masked by concurrent scrapie infections."

To prevent infected meat from pigs and other relevant species entering the human food chain, routine testing is mandatory within European Union (EU) member states. Testing and reporting of Trichinella has continually improved over time, enabling a move towards risk-based surveillance. For example, the official recognition of Trichinella -free production, as well as the sanctioning of risk based monitoring programmes for Trichinella in pigs was introduced into EU legislation in 2006. This has provided a framework for regions to be recognised as presenting a negligible risk of Trichinella in domestic pigs, to allow exemption from Trichinella testing of domestic pigs kept solely for fattening and slaughter.

"Food irradiation is a processing technique that exposes food to high energy ionising radiation to improve shelf life and/or food quality. To support enforcement of legislation there is a need for reliable analytical methods capable of detecting marker compounds that are specific to the irradiation process, such as the 2-alkylcyclobutanones (2-ACBs). Several methods to detect irradiation are available and for fatty foods the standardised European Committee for Standardization (CEN) method EN1785 is based on measurement of 2-ACBs that are produced by the irradiation of lipids. There have been advances in analytical techniques and new methods of isolating and detecting 2-ACBs are available. Improvements to method EN1785 are required to lower detection limits of 2-ACBs. This will aid in an investigation into whether 2-ACBs can be detected in non-irradiated food or in food processed by means other than irradiation. Improvements could also widen the scope of the method and permit detection of the use of irradiated ingredients in composite foods, where lower detection limits will be required. Conversely, lowering of the limit of detection would increase the need to confirm the absence of 2-ACBs in foods that have not been irradiated and possibly derive a threshold value to distinguish irradiated from non-irradiated foods."

In order to discharge this responsibility, the Agency needs to be able to predict radiological doses to consumers that can result from planned and accidental discharges. In the case of S-35, there are significant differences between the measured and predicted levels in foodstuffs. Consequently, there is a need to better understand this discrepancy and to determine whether it is through the modelling or the measurements that these differences arise. There is still some uncertainty over the chemical forms with which S-35 is associated (e.g. H2S and COS) both prior and subsequent to its release from the UK nuclear power industry. Moreover, there are uncertainties also with the behaviour of these chemical species in the environment and their uptake into foodstuffs. This study will review and address these uncertainties. This will help elucidate the differences between the measurements and modelling predictions for S-35, thus assisting the Food Standards Agency to discharge its responsibilities."

Websites were searched using specific terms and, where there was no inbuilt search facility the website areas relating to publications, services and training were examined. The following were noted: publications or other information available accessibility – was the information free to download or order, was purchase required and was it restricted to associates of the site only the format of the information Part 2 A list of small food manufacturers, employing fewer than 50 people, was compiled. The companies listed were obtained from various relevant sources including trade associations, local authorities, regional food groups and Campden BRI information. A set of questions, approved by the Agency, was used to achieve Part 2 of the objectives. A hundred food businesses, chosen by geographic region, business size and business sector, took part in the telephone survey. Interviewees were asked to: state the guidance they used how frequently they reviewed it rate how useful the guidance was on a scale of 1-10 identify the main types of problems experienced against pre-determined areas Further questioning revealed: if businesses actually still required HACCP guidance those which had HACCP-based requirements imposed by their customers if those requirements were perceived as beyond the scope of regulations and burdensome"	"The Department of Business Industry and Science (BIS) indicated to the Agency that small food manufacturing businesses required assistance in implementing the requirement for a HACCP based food safety management system. The Agency already provides a support tool for lower risk food businesses, known as Safer Food Better Business (SFBB) which has been well received. However, the increased complexity of food manufacturing processes is likely to present a higher level of hazard, requiring more sophisticated food safety controls. The Agency intends to develop a web-based support tool to meet the described need.

The results of the scheme will be particularly pertinent to this study. EU or third country research and/or trials which have reviewed the suitability of accreditation schemes, in particular from an enforcement perspective, were of interest. There was some liaison with UK and EU accreditation bodies such as United Kingdom Accreditation service, British Retail Consortium, Global Standard, Global Good Agricultural Practice (Global GAP) and the Soil Association, in relation to organic produce. This involved obtaining a greater understanding about how such schemes work and an evaluation of the types of assurance schemes that are currently available to, and used by UK Importers. Liaison with Public Health Authorities and Local Authorities was necessary in order to best assess what and how information relating to assurance schemes could be presented. There was poor participation in the FSA’s pilot scheme. The research needed to establish the reasons and identify how a future pilot scheme might be introduced in the UK. The research involved contacting a representative number of businesses, ranging from multi-national supermarkets to small and medium-sized cash and carry/wholesale traders, which import fresh fruits and vegetables, using UK designated points of entry."	"Fruits, vegetables and other perishable products make up a significant proportion of the imported food supply. Import controls need to be able to cope with the demand while maintaining a high level of food safety. The European Commission has identified a list of ‘high risk’ products and/or countries as a known or emerging risk to public health. These products are subject to increased controls at the EU border including documentary, identity and physical checks. During the initial implementation of Commission Regulation 669/2009 (the legislation governing the ‘high risk list’), concerns were raised about the potential for delays whilst perishable consignments were detained at UK ports pending the results of sampling and analysis. Some of these ‘high risk’ consignments were sourced from assured traders. An Agency pilot scheme was devised to assess whether the level of compliance with permitted levels of pesticide residues on products subject to increased import checks, was improved if farmers/suppliers were part of independent assurance schemes. The outcome of this voluntary monitoring exercise will be assessed as part of this project. The role of independently accredited certification schemes operating in the global supply chain were also assessed as was the potential role they could play in the better targeting of risk based inspection activity with particular focus on the deployment of imported food checks at UK points of entry."

An evaluation of the guidance was conducted in 2012. The FSA is following up this evaluation with a review of whether alternative controls to cross-contamination are viable (although the FSA remains committed to the position that the dual use of complex equipment for raw and ‘ready-to-eat food’ cannot be regarded as safe practice).

In response to this, the Agency established a programme of work to reduce the risk of similar outbreaks occurring in the future. In 2011 the Agency embarked on the development and dissemination of new guidance for industry and enforcement officers. The purpose of this guidance was: to increase recognition of the threat that Ecoli O157 poses to public health the need for stringent measures during food production to control cross-contamination risks associated with the pathogen. The guidance was produced upon principles that were subject to a formal public consultation in 2010.

Workshops with 10 to 20 authorities will also be held to gather further information to help develop the guidance. Guidance that may impact on enforcing authority’s decisions, resources and food safety must be tested. Therefore, once the guidance has been developed, a moderately scaled pilot application of the guidance will be undertaken with 13 authorities before it is finalised. As part of the pilot authorities will be asked to develop a sampling plan using the guidance method and compare the plan with current practice. Subjective feedback will be sought on the validity of the results, practicality of the method and suggestions for amendments.

This contrast within the devolved nations has created conditions for comparing users and non-users in a controlled manner. Accordingly, the research has explored various hypotheses on why and under which circumstances local authorities would use or not use RANs. It has also aimed at providing rich and nuanced evidence on how RANs have been used. In that process, the team aimed to understand how issues that were dealt with using RANs in some local authorities were dealt with otherwise in other local authorities. Besides, while firm quantitative evidence could not be gathered, the study tried to gather other elements indicating how effective RANs might have been. This included the number of RANs in the sample that had been breached or challenged in court, and their perceived effectiveness, relying for that matter on the views of officers. While doing so, it also gathered quotes on the reasons why officers thought RANs were effective, or, conversely, why other options than RANs might be also effective. The project began with a review of the LAEMS data for local authorities located in the devolved nations. This review intended to explore, among other issues, the distribution of RANs across local authorities. This was then relied on to select cases for a more in-depth qualitative inquiry into regulatory decisions by officers. Both local authorities  which had been serving RANs since the spring of 2012 and local authorities which had served none or very few were approached. Within each sub-group, selection was a function of two sets of parameters: the first set of parameters corresponded to the history of enforcement practices at the local authority. There local authorities  were distinguished in terms of what the data suggested was their ‘enforcement style’. The second set of parameters corresponded to the general profile of the local authority in terms or relative urbanness/ruralness. The aim was to approach local authorities that would present both rural, mixed, and urban profiles. The final sample includes 2 local authorities situated in Northern Ireland, 3 in Wales, and 4 in Scotland. Two additional local authorities located in England were also visited. Those were selected based on similarities with some local authorities located in the devolved nations that had served no RANs or very few. Within each local authority the research team reviewed and discussed with staff a limited number of cases of non-approved food business operators, some of which had received a RAN and some of which had not received any. Besides analysis of food business operator  and local authority  cases, the study undertook also controlled comparative studies across food business operator  cases and across local authorities. Those controlled comparisons provide greater confidence in findings in spite of the small size of the sample of local authoritiesvisited and RANs examined."

At the time RANs could only be served to premises approved under EC Regulation 853/2004. In 2012, amendments to the domestic hygiene legislation in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland extended the scope of RANs into premises that are registered under Regulation 852/2004: premises that do not require approval. That extension was principally motivated by the notion that RANs could help address a gap in enforcement powers, as they could apply to circumstances where other types of notices, such as Hygiene Improvement Notices (HINs) and Hygiene Emergency Improvement Notices (HEPNs) would not be appropriate. This study has reviewed the implementation of that extension, over the period 2012-2015."

It draws on research from the fields of ‘cognitive biases’ and ‘naturalistic decision making’ to understand decision making on food hygiene. These fields of study examine how variations in decision-making arise from heuristics (rules and habits that influence decision-making) and cognitive bias (errors that arise from a heuristic being applied incorrectly). To investigate variance in decision-making by EHOs and the extent to which psychological factors explain this variance, decision-making on food hygiene was studied through a series of experiments. Based within a food and beverage outlet at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) campus, two ‘simulated kitchen’ environments were created, and EHOs were asked to inspect and assess them. Scenarios were designed to examine the impact of three specific biases upon the decision making of EHOs: anchoring, confirmation, and overconfidence. The simulated kitchens replicated aspects of a real catering environment (e.g. equipment, facilities food preparation, catering staff, food storage), and contained a number of positive (e.g. food storage) and negative informational cues (e.g. out-of-date records) that were expected to influence ratings in food hygiene (environmental health) inspections. To assess whether an ‘anchoring bias’ influences assessments of food safety, the team examined whether the assessments of the experimental catering facilities by inspectors are in-part determined by information on a previous inspection. To assess if ‘confirmation bias’ influences assessments of food hygiene, the team examined whether the decision-making of EHOs is influenced by an early informational cue presented during an inspection. To assess ‘over-confidence bias ’, the team examined whether high or low confidence in EHOs (as measured by a post-study survey on self-assessed confidence and confidence on a number of knowledge items) results in differential assessments of catering facilities. Read the report on consistency and cognitive influences on the expert judgement of Environmental Health Officers . Study 2: Analysis of LAEMS data to inform a study on inconsistencies in the delivery of official food safety controls Data from the Local Authority Enforcement and Monitoring System (LAEMS) was analysed to identify potential inconsistencies between local authorities in the delivery of official controls, in particular with regards to the Confidence in Management scoring of food establishments and enforcement activity. This was to inform the selection of local authorities for the third study: Consistency in the delivery of official food safety controls: the role of organisational-level factors . Read the report on analysis of LAEMS data to inform a study on inconsistencies in the delivery of official food safety controls Study 3: Consistency in the delivery of official food safety controls: the role of organisational-level factors The study aimed to explore how organisational-level factors impact on the delivery of official controls by local authorities, and how they might contribute to inconsistencies in (i) the scoring of Confidence in Management (CIM) in food businesses, and (ii) enforcement responses to non-compliance with food hygiene inspections. Thirteen factors were identified for exploration in the research. They were categorised into three broad themes (management practices, structure, and communications and engagement). From the outset, the Agency was interested in distinguishing variations in the delivery of official controls that might be justified or acceptable (e.g. targeted interventions), from other variations that could be considered ‘true’ inconsistencies. The latter were the core focus of this research. The study has contributed to clarifying that distinction for the field of food hygiene controls by looking at numerous specific examples arising from the data. In order to achieve this, a small-scale, comparative approach was adopted, based on a programme of qualitative research with five pairs of comparable English local authorities, representing different categories of urban-rural classification. The local authorities were selected by the FSA on the basis of the statistical analysis of the LAEMS data. Between four and six in-depth interviews were conducted with individuals occupying various roles in each authority, to gather feedback from a range of perspectives (totalling 49 interviews across the case studies). The interview findings fed into a comparative analysis process that explored the role of each organisational-level factor on inconsistencies in CIM scoring and enforcement action. Read the report on consistency in the delivery of official food safety controls: the role of organisational-level factors"	"Consistent regulation is essential to achieving optimal policy outcomes on a national scale, yet it is also notoriously difficult to achieve. Difficulty arises from the wide range of factors that may generate inconsistencies in controls: individual-level factors, such as the level of experience of individual inspectors; organisational-level factors, such as the structure and working habits of teams within enforcing authorities; or macro-level factors, such as institutions and broad societal factors. Moreover, inspectors and authorities need to adapt general rules to the variety of circumstances on the ground. Regulatory practice should not be uniform but rather reflect objective differences between different regulated individuals or businesses. As a consequence, however, it is not easy to draw a line between ‘normal’ variations (resulting from objective differences between regulatees on the ground) and ‘inconsistencies’. This particular research programme aimed to improve the evidence base on which the FSA’s efforts towards consistency could be built and revised. It is highly innovative, as very little analytical work of any significant scope has been published on consistency in regulation. It is therefore one of the first co-ordinated and multi-disciplinary attempts to better measure and explain consistency and inconsistency through the use of analytical methods.

The species investigated were red meat and large game i.e. cattle, sheep, goats, wild and farmed deer. Each relevant disease or condition were assessed according to the following categories: traditional or visual-only meat inspection; and whether or not they conformed to the criteria for controlled housing (as defined in the research report). Conditions and diseases which can only be detected by incision and palpation were identified and those relevant to public health, animal health and animal welfare were noted for further assessment. The identified hazards were qualitatively assessed for the risk they pose to public and animal health and welfare, under conforming and non-conforming production systems. The information was gathered from databases, including VLA VetNet, industry health schemes and Agency databases. Where these did not yield sufficient evidence, any differences in prevalence between conforming and non-conforming systems were qualitatively assessed. Any diseases or conditions which had a higher incidence in non-conforming systems were taken forward for a full risk-benefit assessment, to determine if the risk increased when using visual-only PMMI. A benefit analysis was carried out to examine the potential public health benefits that might be gained using visual-only inspection."	"The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is currently assessing post-mortem meat inspection (PMMI) tasks for a range of livestock species, in order to create a system of meat inspection which is relevant, effective and risk-based. The current PMMI procedures, which consist of visual examination, palpation and incision, have changed little in the last century. These techniques do not detect current foodborne hazards, such as salmonella and campylobacter, and may also give rise to the risk of cross -contamination."

To validate the results from the field study, PCR-based methods were used to test stored samples for DNA specific for salmonella and yersinia, rather than repeat the same culture-based tests which were completed on the original samples. This was done to re-determine the presence/absence of salmonella and yersinia using a different method of measurement (PCR as opposed to culture). The following approach was taken: identification of yersinia isolated in project FS145003 determination of the presence or absence of yersinia and salmonella DNA in frozen samples, archived from project FS145003, using PCR testing and analysis comparison of the molecular testing results with the traditional culture results from project FS145003"	"Traditional post mortem inspection includes palpation and incision, which can potentially increase the risk of contamination, while visual-only post mortem inspection reduces handling of the carcass. In previous work entitled ‘A trial of visual inspection of fattening pigs from non-controlled housing conditions’, the frequency and types of conditions that could be identified at slaughter by the two different meat inspection methods was investigated. This was to see if there was a difference between the two methods that might lead to a change in risk to human health/animal health/animal welfare, if the inspection method was changed for pigs reared outdoors. Traditional microbiological techniques isolated 12 yersinia species and no salmonella species. No statistical difference was found in the proportion of carcasses contaminated with Yersinia spp. The low numbers of bacteria found (ie the microbiological outcomes) were not unexpected, given that the abattoir had an extremely high level of hygiene. Low levels of total aerobic and coliform bacterial counts were also obtained. To check the findings of the study discussed above, this project was commissioned to carry out additional molecular testing on samples that had been stored from the original study. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests were used to detect DNA from salmonella and Yersinia spp. Additional techniques were also used to find out more about the species of yersinia that had been found."

The prevalence of these particular conditions was assessed by analysing datasets from the FSA Operations Group, British Pig Health Scheme, Wholesome Pigs Scotland and Food Chain Information from abattoirs. To assess any increased human/animal exposure to critical conditions because of visual inspection of outdoor pigs, each condition was evaluated so as to discover the likelihood of not detecting them in outdoor pigs compared to indoor pigs. Individual risk estimates for each critical condition and each risk type (public health, animal health and welfare) were produced. The results showed where increased risk lies in removing palpation and incision from post-mortem inspection of outdoor pigs, and also established any possible benefits."	"(FS245009) EC Regulation 854/2004 allows for fattening pigs, housed under controlled conditions since weaning, to undergo only visual inspection, rather than the mandatory palpation of major organs and incisions in the heart and lymph nodes, which applies to outdoor pigs. This study tested the assumption that outdoor pigs require invasive inspection to guarantee adequate consumer protection levels. A qualitative veterinary risk assessment was used to evaluate the changes in human/animal risk due to transferring from traditional to visual inspection. Assuming that visual inspection of indoor pigs is an acceptable risk, a risk assessment was produced that estimated the increased risk, if any, posed by outdoor pigs compared with indoor pigs.

Collection and communication of inspection results (CCIR) refers to information that is collected during ante and post mortem inspection by officials and sent back to farmers to improve animal health and welfare and ultimately food safety. FCI and CCIR form part of the whole chain, farm-to-fork approach to food safety introduced by hygiene regulations on 1 January 2006. In 2012, the FSA commissioned research to review the current implementation of FCI and CCIR. The research highlighted differences in the application of the food chain information flow between the sectors of poultry and pigs and the sectors of cattle and sheep. The research also made a series of recommendations, such as to carry out a risk assessment for each species to account for different production and marketing systems, and to highlight key information for recording rather than minimum elements.

"Bovine cysticercosis is caused by the larval stage of the human tapeworm Taenia saginata. Cattle become infected through the accidental ingestion of food or water which has been contaminated with human faeces. After 8-10 weeks the larvae will establish in the muscles and develop into cysts. The presence of Taenia sanginata cysts in cattle is determined during post mortem meat inspection and enforced through Regulation (EC) No 854/2004. Carcasses with visible cysts are either downgraded or condemned depending on the amount and type of visible cysts. In Britain, positive cases detected during post mortem inspection are recorded in the FSA national meat inspection database, but without additional information on animal or farm characteristics. Farm characteristics, such as water source, type of production and geographic location are likely to influence the likelihood of Cysticercus bovis infection.

It aimed to establish the frequency and type of findings that could be expected when using visual-only inspection versus traditional inspection methods. The effects on contamination levels, as a result of the handling of carcasses, were also investigated. The trial was designed so that all carcases were inspected or re-inspected according to current regulatory requirements, so they could be put on the market without risk. Microbiological sampling for enterobacteriaceae, salmonella and yersinia were applied to identify differences in the risk of using traditional inspection methods for carcasses, compared to visual-only inspection. The findings were used to identify any issues which may prevent the implementation of a risk based visual-only inspection system. Appropriate adaptations to overcome these problems, such as different dressing procedures or food chain information (FCI) requirements, were considered. A qualitative risk assessment, on the impact of the implementation of visual-only inspection for outdoor pigs and its consequence on public health, animal health and welfare, was drawn up."	"A previous study funded by the Agency compared post mortem inspection (PMI) findings of ‘outdoor’ and ‘indoor’ fattening pigs, using a qualitative risk assessment approach (see project MC1002: Comparison of post-mortem inspection findings of outdoor and indoor fattening pigs: a qualitative risk assessment approach ). The results suggested that moving to visual-only post mortem inspection for 'outdoor pigs' would not pose an increased risk to public health, animal health and welfare. Traditional PMI includes palpation and incision which can potentially increase the risk of contamination, while visual-only PMI reduces handling of the carcass. This study focused on whether visual PMI of 'outdoor pigs' presents a significant risk above that accepted for 'indoor pigs' based on the current provisions in the regulations."

This involved interviews with stakeholders about trends, asking LAs and PHAs to report trends, and analysis of Local Authority Enforcement Monitoring System (LAEMS) and UK Food Surveillance system (UKFSS) data held by the FSA on the number of sample analyses per year.. 2) What are the reasons for these trends? This entailed exploratory interviews with LAs, PHAs and stakeholder representatives, and a survey of LAs and PHAs about the cause of trends and local sampling policy. The analysis of LAEMS data on food samples also revealed differences in sampling practices between types of LAs and countries that indicated some additional factors. 3) What is the probability of detecting unsatisfactory results? UKFSS data for 2012 was assessed to determine the statistical probability of detecting unsatisfactory results per category of products and type of analyses. 4) What potential improvements could be made? Suggestions for potential improvements were drawn from stakeholder feedback, research findings and consideration of parallel FSA studies into risk-based sampling."

It draws on research from the fields of ‘cognitive biases’ and ‘naturalistic decision making’ to understand decision making on food hygiene. These fields of study examine how variations in decision-making arise from heuristics (rules and habits that influence decision-making) and cognitive bias (errors that arise from a heuristic being applied incorrectly). To investigate variance in decision-making by EHOs and the extent to which psychological factors explain this variance, decision-making on food hygiene was studied through a series of experiments. Based within a food and beverage outlet at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) campus, two ‘simulated kitchen’ environments were created, and EHOs were asked to inspect and assess them. Scenarios were designed to examine the impact of three specific biases upon the decision making of EHOs: anchoring, confirmation, and overconfidence. The simulated kitchens replicated aspects of a real catering environment (e.g. equipment, facilities food preparation, catering staff, food storage), and contained a number of positive (e.g. food storage) and negative informational cues (e.g. out-of-date records) that were expected to influence ratings in food hygiene (environmental health) inspections. To assess whether an ‘anchoring bias’ influences assessments of food safety, the team examined whether the assessments of the experimental catering facilities by inspectors are in-part determined by information on a previous inspection. To assess if ‘confirmation bias’ influences assessments of food hygiene, the team examined whether the decision-making of EHOs is influenced by an early informational cue presented during an inspection. To assess ‘over-confidence bias ’, the team examined whether high or low confidence in EHOs (as measured by a post-study survey on self-assessed confidence and confidence on a number of knowledge items) results in differential assessments of catering facilities. Read the report on consistency and cognitive influences on the expert judgement of Environmental Health Officers . Study 2: Analysis of LAEMS data to inform a study on inconsistencies in the delivery of official food safety controls Data from the Local Authority Enforcement and Monitoring System (LAEMS) was analysed to identify potential inconsistencies between local authorities in the delivery of official controls, in particular with regards to the Confidence in Management scoring of food establishments and enforcement activity. This was to inform the selection of local authorities for the third study: Consistency in the delivery of official food safety controls: the role of organisational-level factors . Read the report on analysis of LAEMS data to inform a study on inconsistencies in the delivery of official food safety controls Study 3: Consistency in the delivery of official food safety controls: the role of organisational-level factors The study aimed to explore how organisational-level factors impact on the delivery of official controls by local authorities, and how they might contribute to inconsistencies in (i) the scoring of Confidence in Management (CIM) in food businesses, and (ii) enforcement responses to non-compliance with food hygiene inspections. Thirteen factors were identified for exploration in the research. They were categorised into three broad themes (management practices, structure, and communications and engagement). From the outset, the Agency was interested in distinguishing variations in the delivery of official controls that might be justified or acceptable (e.g. targeted interventions), from other variations that could be considered ‘true’ inconsistencies. The latter were the core focus of this research. The study has contributed to clarifying that distinction for the field of food hygiene controls by looking at numerous specific examples arising from the data. In order to achieve this, a small-scale, comparative approach was adopted, based on a programme of qualitative research with five pairs of comparable English local authorities, representing different categories of urban-rural classification. The local authorities were selected by the FSA on the basis of the statistical analysis of the LAEMS data. Between four and six in-depth interviews were conducted with individuals occupying various roles in each authority, to gather feedback from a range of perspectives (totalling 49 interviews across the case studies). The interview findings fed into a comparative analysis process that explored the role of each organisational-level factor on inconsistencies in CIM scoring and enforcement action. Read the report on consistency in the delivery of official food safety controls: the role of organisational-level factors"	"Consistent regulation is essential to achieving optimal policy outcomes on a national scale, yet it is also notoriously difficult to achieve. Difficulty arises from the wide range of factors that may generate inconsistencies in controls: individual-level factors, such as the level of experience of individual inspectors; organisational-level factors, such as the structure and working habits of teams within enforcing authorities; or macro-level factors, such as institutions and broad societal factors. Moreover, inspectors and authorities need to adapt general rules to the variety of circumstances on the ground. Regulatory practice should not be uniform but rather reflect objective differences between different regulated individuals or businesses. As a consequence, however, it is not easy to draw a line between ‘normal’ variations (resulting from objective differences between regulatees on the ground) and ‘inconsistencies’. This particular research programme aimed to improve the evidence base on which the FSA’s efforts towards consistency could be built and revised. It is highly innovative, as very little analytical work of any significant scope has been published on consistency in regulation. It is therefore one of the first co-ordinated and multi-disciplinary attempts to better measure and explain consistency and inconsistency through the use of analytical methods.

"Canthaxanthin (E 161g) is a type of carotenoid pigment with an orange-red colour. It occurs naturally in many foods such as mushrooms, crustaceans, fish and eggs. The pigment has also been produced by synthetical means. Canthaxanthin is primarily used as a feed additive for animals. It can lead to a more intensely coloured egg yolk and flesh from poultry, and a more reddish colour for salmon. It is authorised for use as a feed additive in the EU for the sole purpose of colouring food. The provisions of Council Directive 70/524 control its use, where an authorised concentration for complete feedingstuffs for salmonids and poultry is given. An acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 0.03 mg canthaxanthin per kg of body weight has been established in the EU by the Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) and The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA). The EU Scientific Committee on Animal Nutrition (SCAN) has expressed the opinion that the ADI may be exceeded by high consumers of salmonid and/or poultry products, and has therefore suggested that the maximum concentration of canthaxanthin allowed in feedingstuffs be reduced. As a consequence of the SCAN opinion, the EC may propose revised maximum concentrations for canthaxanthin in feedingstuffs which is likely to increase demand for the determination of carotenoid concentrations in feeds. If Trading Standards Departments, via Public Analysts, are to enforce any revised Regulations prescribing maximum limits for canthaxanthin (and associated carotenoids), then a validated analytical method must be available. The objective of this project is to provide such a validated method."	"LGC limited"	"-1"	"65"	"Institution not in the DB; please collect information manually and populate in institution_data table."

The guidelines would also provide information for retailers on how to store their part of the sample. The project objectives were: to identify appropriate storage conditions for sample transport; to identify appropriate conditions for the long-term storage, of official samples to provide clear advice to ensure that all three parts of an official sample remain representative and reflect the state of the product at the time of sampling to be applicable to the food industry's own samples taken for routine or due diligence purposes The guidelines apply to samples for analysis but not to samples for examination. As part of the project, a review of local authority practices was carried out and reported. Also, storage trials were carried out on formal food samples that were stored either frozen or chilled. This was to simulate the storage that would occur to the part of the sample that is retained, possibly for long periods (a year) for analysis in cases of dispute by the referee analyst. Samples of sausages (sulphur dioxide), rancid chicken (free fatty acids in fat and protein breakdown), whisky (alcohol) and fruit juice (vitamin C) were stored and analysed at varying intervals."	"The Food Safety Act 1990 empowers authorised officers to take or purchase samples which they have reason to believe may be required as evidence in proceedings under any of the sections of the Act, or the regulations or orders made under it. If they consider that the samples should be analysed then they must be submitted to a public analyst for the appropriate analysis. One of the most common reasons for food enforcement actions to fail is doubt about the validity of analytical data presented. Furthermore, these criticisms often relate to the condition and history of the 'official food sample' when it is submitted for analysis. In 1999, questions addressed to 12 local authorities indicated the lack of any clear, practicable and technically valid guidelines for the preservation of official samples for analysis. Furthermore, a series of codes of practice and international standards, which refer to food sampling, have little or no guidance relating to sample storage."

It is essential to characterise the candidate sampling targets before the SPT in terms of essential characteristics (see above). In order to detect any temporal change, the target will need to be characterised for the target analyte before and after the SPT. Participants with relevant experience of the sampling target/analyte will be selected, given a clear description of their objective and instructions for the SPT. The instruction will clearly identify the sampling target and the participants must select whatever protocol they consider most appropriate. The scoring scheme will be devised in general agreement with the harmonised protocol for analytical proficiency tests (Thompson et al. for IUPAC, 2005), but adapted to the particular requirements of a SPT. Participants will be supplied with their ?score? with related comments and estimates of the measurement uncertainty. Comments on both the practicality and usefulness of the SPT from participants and organisers will be collated. The constraints on the selection of the sampling target and participants will be reviewed and conclusions reached as to the broad applicability of SPTs in the food sector. The usefulness to the participants will be reviewed, and compared with the perceived usefulness of analytical PTs. Lessons learnt from the initial application will be addressed in a second application of the SPT in the later stages of the research project."	"The quality of measurements made to assess the concentration of components in food is fundamental. The decisions made by producers, vendors, consumers and the regulators of foods rely upon their accuracy. In recent years, it has been increasingly realised that an important part of the measurement process is often the sampling of the food that takes place outside the laboratory. In a Sampling Proficiency Test (SPT), several organisations (n ? 8) are required to take independent samples, and make analytical measurements, on the same sampling target. This would typically be a bulk consignment of a food material. The analytical measurments can be made by each participant (or their nominee), but the concept of the SPT is tested initially when all the chemical analyses are made in one laboratory. The proposed SPT on food will be the first of its kind in the world, and will provide a new tool for assessing the proficiency of samplers. This will help the individual samplers to improve their performance, and become aware of the effect of sample heterogeneity on the measurement result. Potentially, it will also improve the quality of sampling in the whole food sector, which has happened as a consequence of analytical proficiency tests. This will enable better international comparability of measurements, especially if future SPTs are conducted with international participation. Moreover, the results of any SPT will provide information to enable more realistic estimates of the uncertainty of measurements. This, in turn, will improve the reliability of decisions based upon the composition and contamination of foods."

"FSA in NI and Scotland has statutory remit for dietary health and labelling. Monitoring suggests consumers in NI and Scotland make poor dietary choices. Recent information ( see 'Published papers' below) suggests the annual cost of ill health due to diet to UK NHS is £5.8 billion. This translates to estimated cost in NI of £168 million, while in Scotland the estimated total cost of obesity to society in 2007/08 was in excess of £457 million. The Scottish Government’s Preventing Obesity Route Map outlines support for consumers to make less energy-dense food choices, including implementation of FoP recommendations. The role food manufacturers play in informing consumers so that they can make more healthy, informed food choices has become particularly acute with ‘A Fitter Future for All’, a cross-Departmental Obesity prevention strategy for Northern Ireland. The ultimate long-term outcome is ‘Healthier food options are available and accessible to the whole population’. This requires measurement of performance indicators.
