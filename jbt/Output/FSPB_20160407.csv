Typhimurium DT104 in Dublin in 1998 and the West of Ireland in 2000 which were linked to cooked ham resulted in 78 people and 140 people becoming ill respectively.In the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, two different approaches are taken to control Salmonella in pigs. In the Republic of Ireland, every pig herd is tested on the farm on a quarterly basis to establish its Salmonella status. The category status assigned determines the treatment at slaughter and affects the need for further treatment or the destination of the meat. In  Northern Ireland , there is no statutory requirement for Salmonella testing in pork. There is a voluntary system in place which tests juice from meat samples for Salmonella antibodies as they go through the abattoir. Results are compared to the national average and specialist advice is given to farms producing pigs which display high levels of contamination.The overall aim of this project was to assess the effectiveness of current control programmes and the public health risk and economic cost attributable to Salmonella on pork on the island of Ireland.

Although it is permitted as a food ingredient in the EU and elsewhere, the use of MSG remains controversial. In the EU, MSG like other permitted food additives, must appear on the label if used as a deliberate ingredient and has been ascribed the E number 621. MSG has been used as a food additive for decades. Anecdotal reports of adverse reactions to MSG have been reported.  Symptoms include headache, flushing, sweating, facial pressure or tightness, numbness, tingling or burning in face, neck and other areas, heart palpitations, chest pain, nausea and weakness. Adverse reactions are simply known as ""MSG symptom complex""; there is no definitive evidence of a causal link between MSG consumption and these symptoms. The consumption of MSG is essentially a consumer choice issue.This survey investigated MSG usage in Chinese, Indian and Thai restaurants and take-away outlets in Cork and Belfast. MSG use varied considerably from one premises to another. The number of premises that used excessive amounts of MSG was very low.  Importantly, the results showed that even where MSG is not used, you can still get free glutamate from other ingredients. MSG-free options always had much lower free glutamate levels indicating that a request for an MSG-free meal can be accommodated. Since free glutamate was detected in all cuisine tested, it is in the interests of the staff to advise their customers that (a) they don’t add MSG to their dishes or, where it is added, this step can be omitted, and (b) their dishes may contain free glutamate from other ingredients."

Such reports serve to alarm the public and cause a loss of faith in food producers. Many of these incidents are due to the complexity of the food supply chain and often catch companies totally unaware. Work has been pioneered by The Institute of Global Food Security at Queen’s University Belfast in developing a risk management system for the animal feed industry on the island of Ireland. The database outcome from this work is now being implemented by a large number of UK and Irish companies that import feed materials onto the island of Ireland to target their monitoring programme for contaminants.The concept of developing a similar risk register ( Food Hazard Select ) for pig and poultry foods produced on the Island of Ireland is the subject of the current proposal. The pork and poultry industry are major employers on the island of Ireland and export large quantities of products. The quality and safety of these products is of paramount importance and any issues in relation to either parameter can cause massive reputational damage, not only to the company involved but the entire industry. A system will be developed to produce a Risk Register based on analysing data from a wide range of existing sources, some in the public domain and some confidential. The information will be ranked for severity of impact and will be used by the industry to fine tune their testing programmes. Thus the amount of industry testing can be increased while at the same time significantly reducing analytical costs.With regards to the major risks identified the project will set out to identify better means of testing based on recent advances in analytical and bio-analytical sciences. Participating industries will receive a series of recommendations about what methods to make use of, either in their own laboratories, governmental laboratories and of commercial testing facilities."

In addition, the toxicological information on these drugs is incomplete. While the likelihood of consumers being exposed to toxic levels is very low, best practice dictates that poultry food products should not contain residues of these drugs. It is therefore important for poultry and egg producers to ensure that this does not happen.This project identified mechanisms by which the primary producer could control the utilisation of medicated feed in their production facilities to ensure that coccidiostat residues would not occur in their product. Specific analytical testing methods for the detection of these drug residues in poultry were developed during this project.The outcomes of this project were evaluated at a later stage (Project Reference: 06-2007).

Two antibody based tests – ELISA and biosensor immunoassays – were produced and were shown to give rapid, quantitative and reproducible results for large numbers of food samples and across a wide range of food matrices.In addition, these methods were shown to detect adducted acrylamide in human blood samples. Rapid sample preparation permits the analysis of a greater number of samples per day than would be possible with an equivalent LC/MS-MS system. Both ELISA and biosensor immunoassays for the detection of acrylamide in food were the first of their kind."

This aspiration must be substantiated by activities to check whether food is mis-described. EU legislation requires meat to be labelled with the animal species from which it comes, and to quantify the meat ingredients. Mechanically recovered meat falls outside this definition and cannot count towards the meat content. Similarly, other parts of the carcass such as heart, liver, kidney, etc., must also be labelled separately, and the generic term ""offal"" is not permitted. Therefore, in order to check compliance with these labelling requirements, analytical DNA-based techniques are available to detect and quantify meat species and other meat ingredients in meat products. A number of species-specific methods have been developed for the detection of beef, lamb, pork, chicken and turkey.The purpose of this project was to enhance the capacity of the Public Analyst system on the island of Ireland by facilitating the implementation of methods that could then be used to determine the authenticity of processed meat products. Method development concentrated on chicken burgers and sausages (cheaper brands). The project was part of an ongoing collaboration between safe food and the Public Analyst Laboratories and in this instance involved the Cork Public Analyst Laboratory which has been designated the National Reference Laboratory for meat speciation by the Dept. of Health & Children. In conjunction with the project, Cork PAL personnel availed of the Training and Mobility Programme travel grant scheme of the safe food Knowledge Networks to attend the JRC Joint Research Centre, Molecular Biology and Genomics Unit in Warsaw."

Epidemiological studies have shown an inverse correlation between acute coronary events and high intake of dietary vitamin E. Vitamin E may help prevent or delay coronary heart disease by limiting the oxidation of Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol. Vitamin E also may help prevent the formation of blood clots, which could lead to a heart attack. However, clinical trials with the main form of Vitamin E have been disappointing. Currently in Ireland, approximately 25% of adults augment their diets with commercially available nutritional supplements.This study investigated the role of the different forms of vitamin E and their protective effects and examined the appropriateness of supplementation of the diet with vitamin E. The study was carried out with special reference to smokers, as other factors have to be considered in the provision of advice to this subsection of the population."
