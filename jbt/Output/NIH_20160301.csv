Vibrio cholerae causes severe secretory diarrhea in humans, and is a prototypical mucosal infection that does not invade the intestinal epithelium; V. cholerae infection thus serves as an excellent model for the study of mucosal immunity and vaccination. Unfortunately, protective immunity following cholera is not currently understood, and available cholera vaccines either fail to produce full protective efficacy or induce less than optimal and relatively short-lived immune responses that fall to baseline within 6-36 months of vaccination. This is in comparison to natural infection with V. cholerae that induces protective immunity that lasts for 3-10 years. Serum vibriocidal and other serum antibody responses wane within 6-12 months of infection, suggesting that these current immunologic markers cannot be used as correlates of longer-term protective immunity. We have data to suggest that memory B cell responses to T-dependent protein antigens develop following V. cholerae infection and persist for at least one year, while memory B cell responses to a T-independent antigen, LPS, develop following cholera, but appear to wane by 9-12 months following infection. We have additional preliminary evidence of a CD4+ T helper cell response following V. cholerae infection, and we hypothesize that this response is necessary for the development and maintenance of B cell memory at the mucosal surface, that the T cell response may be qualitatively or quantitatively different between natural infection and cholera vaccination, and that these differences may explain the lessened efficacy of current vaccines for cholera and other mucosal infections. To address these questions, we propose five specific aims: (1) Characterize immune responses in blood following natural cholera, focusing on development and maintenance of memory B cell and T cell responses; (2) Evaluate mucosal innate and acquired immune responses following cholera using endoscopically obtained duodenal (EGD) samples, and correlate with responses seen in blood; (3) Assess innate and acquired immune responses early after exposure in household contacts to determine correlates of subsequent protective immunity to cholera; (4) Assess immune responses following cholera vaccination with the current killed oral rBS-WC cholera vaccine (synergizing with an on-going and separately funded cholera vaccine study), and compare responses to those following natural cholera; and (5) Evaluate host factors influencing susceptibility and immune responses to cholera.

In the currently proposed studies, we will screen the genome of E. coli O157:H7 to identify protective antigens that would become components of a human vaccine, and such approach can be used to protect against pathogenic E. coli infections without affecting commensal flora. The central hypothesis is that identification of protective antigens unique to O157:H7 is a viable approach for development of a vaccine for prevention of diarrhea and Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome episodes. Progress in recent years identifying E. coli O157:H7 novel virulence factors suggest that they can become useful components of a vaccine candidate. Of particular note are those proteins expressed on the bacterial membranes or secreted to the extracellular milieu, which have been previously associated with virulence traits. Therefore, it is plausible to propose that E. coli O157:H7-specific genes can become excellent candidates as components of vaccines. Our proposed experimental approach will focus on two specific aims: Identify the O157-specific gene sequences of E. coli O157:H7 and use them to generate a library of expression constructs optimized for vaccine screening; and determine the protective capacity of O157-specific gene sequence using a murine model of E. coli O157:H7 infection, to identify a subset of subunit vaccine candidates. Our proposal is significant because it is expected to provide the basic knowledge needed to develop an optimal vaccine that will be used to prevent infections caused by E. coli O157:H7, a category B pathogen for its potential use as biothreat agents in food and agriculture, and eventually to treat infections caused by other related pathogenic E. coli strains.",E.

5R37AI016935-28,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Shigella species and enteroinvasive E. coli invade and multiply within intestinal epithelial  cells of their human host. The bacteria are able to spread directly to adjacent epithelial cells  and the invasion and resulting host inflammatory response cause the symptoms of dysentery, a  disease responsible for significant morbidity and mortality worldwide.   These invasive pathogens are able to rapidly adapt to the intracellular environment of the  host and acquire the essential nutrients for their survival. In particular, they must compete with  the host for the essential element iron. Shigella and pathogenic E. coli have multiple  mechanisms for iron acquisition. These include the synthesis and transport of low molecular  weight iron binding compounds called siderophores and transport of ferric iron, ferrous iron or  heme. One of the goals of this project is to define and more fully characterize these systems for  iron acquisition. In addition, we will determine the mechanism of regulation of expression of  these systems and determine how iron regulates a large number of genes within the bacterial  cells. We have shown that an iron-binding represser protein (Fur) and a small RNA (RyhB) are  involved in regulation of gene expression, including regulation of virulence genes. Microarray  analysis and genetic screens will be used to reveal the full spectrum of genes regulated by iron,  Fur, and RyhB in these pathogens. We have found that RyhB regulates the expression of a  number of genes, including virulence plasmid genes that encode invasion proteins and the type  III secretion apparatus, and chromosomal genes involved in acid resistance. These affects  appear to be the result of RyhB repression of the virulence gene transcription factor VirB and the  acid resistance regulator EvgAS. We will determine the mechanism by which RyhB controls the  expression of virB and evgAS. These studies will help define the global regulatory patterns that  allow Shigella to respond to the various environments that it encounters in the host such as the  acidity of the stomach and the low iron environment within host cells.",Iron Transport In Shigella And Pathogenic E.coli,1980,2013,"Payne, Shelley M.","University of Texas, Austin",Austin,TX,51,1,-1,1534

Serious disease sequelae can follow gastrointesfinal (Gl) infections with C. jejuni. The acute neuropathies Guillain Barre Syndrome (GBS) and Miller Fisher Syndrome (MFS) are autoimmune conditions associated with recent Campy/o/jacter infection. GBS is the worid's leading cause of acute neuromuscular paralysis. 5% of GBS patients die; 15-20% are left with life-long disability. Our long-term goal is to understand the mechanisms that initiate autoimmunity secondary to C.ye/un/infection. Our short-term goal in this proposal is to further develop murine models of GBS and MFS to allow understanding of how infection with particular C. jejuni strains leads to inifiafion of autoimmunity. Eariy work by our group showed that autoantibodies and neurological disease develop spontaneously in Non-Obese Diabefic (NOD) WT, NOD IL-10-/- and NOD B7-  2-1- mice after oral infection with C. jejuni strains from GBS patients.

5K08AI091655-03,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Currently, clear dietary recommendations for pregnant and breastfeeding mothers are lacking regarding allergy prevention in allergic or non-allergic families, although there is a great need to have firm evidence-based guidelines to advise families. Human studies to investigate the effect of strict food allergen avoidance, such as peanut, during pregnancy and lactation on the infant's risk towards development of food allergy are difficult to perform and potentially unethical. Animal studies have suggested that tolerance is induced by perinatal feeding of antigen. These studies have assessed naive mothers to assess risk of OVA-triggered asthma and peanut-allergic mothers to assess risk of peanut allergy. The novelty of this proposal is to assess mothers who are tolerant to the food in question, which is relevant to most of the humans. In the current proposal, we therefore aim to address the effect of feeding peanut during lactation on the offspring's predisposition toward allergic sensitization using an animal model of peanut allergy. We also aim to determine the potential mechanism of oral tolerance development provided via maternal milk. These animal studies will establish biological basis for maternal and infant feeding guidelines in order to address the increasing frequency of food allergies. Once basic mechanisms of this protection against or increased risk towards food allergy have been detected, the future studies could be performed in a human cohort of mothers who choose or do not choose to adhere to avoidance diets.    My immediate goal is to obtain intensive training in immunobiology and experimental models of food allergy to add to my skills in mucosal immunology and maternal-infant interface of immunity. As a long-term goal, I strive to pursue a career in translational research to utilize both my skills in basic research as well as patient care and with that would like to develop into an independent research investigator. The proposed career development activities are a combination of coursework and informal training that will strengthen my knowledge and research skills in immunobiology applied to oral tolerance development. The Pediatric Allergy and Immunology Division and The Immunology Institute Mount Sinai School of Medicine provide an excellent forum for these activities, which include informal interactions with the faculty as well as formal courses in immunobiology and biostatistics, journal clubs, seminars and work-in- progress presentations, as well as training in responsible conduct of research.

The prevalence of V. parahaemolyticus in the environment and incidence of infection have been linked to rising water temperatures caused by global warming. A T3SS is a needle-like structure that efficiently translocates virulence factors from bacteria into the cytosol of a host cell. The virulence factors (also called bacterial effectors) have evolved in a manner similar to many of the viral oncogenes; a eukaryotic activity is usurped and modified by the pathogen for its own advantage. Genomic sequencing of V. parahaemolyticus revealed the existence of two pathogenicity islands that encode both a T3SS and putative effectors. The first pathogenicity island contains T3SS1 and is associated with a cytotoxicity, while the second pathogenicity island contains T3SS2 and is associated with an enterotoxicity. The effectors on the first pathogenicity island have been identified as open reading frames with no obvious homology to any known protein. Recently, we have demonstrated that the V. parahaemolyticus uses T3SS1 to orchestrate a multifaceted host cell infection by induction of autophagy, cell rounding and then cell lysis. We have shown one of the T3SS1 effectors, VopS, utilizes a novel posttranslational modification called AMPylation to disrupt host signaling. Herein, we propose Specific Aims to study the multifaceted death induced by T3SS1 by identifying the activity and host targets of three known effectors, identify other effectors secreted by T3SS1 and characterize the host signaling pathways that are disrupted by V. parahaemolyticus during infection.

1R21AI098701-01,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"It is becoming increasingly recognized that the therapy of infectious diseases is facing twin threats. On the one hand antibiotic and antiviral resistance is rising rapidly; on the other there are relatively few novel compounds under development or entering the clinic. One promising set of compounds are the cationic host defense (antimicrobial) peptides, that collectively have anti-biofilm, antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities and are naturally produced by virtually all complex organisms ranging from plants and insects to humans as a major component of their innate defenses against infection. Our research has been instrumental in delivering, to clinical trials, both topicl antimicrobials and selectively immunomodulatory innate defense regulator (IDR) peptides; however these trials did not explore the full potential of these molecules. Recently we demonstrated that some of these peptides suppress the formation of biofilms by a number of serious Gram negative bacterial infections. Here we are pursuing this strategy as an adjunct to conventional antibiotic therapy. It is particularly relevant since bacteria causing infections ofte (60%) grow as biofilms that are specialized colonial structures that are highly resistant to conventional antibiotics. The objective here is this to suppress biofilm infection by highly resistant and dangerous pathogens, making these infections more susceptible to conventional antibiotics. Our major broad long term objective is thus to create badly needed new approaches to treating infections to overcome antibiotic resistance in the face of a dearth in new antibiotic discovery. Our Specific Aims, in large part based on preliminary data, are (1) identify peptides with optimized activities that are smaller and resistant to proteases, (2) test synergy with a variety of conventional antibiotics against organisms in the biofilm state, (3) understand the mechanism(s) of anti-biofilm activity and (4) characterize their activity in realistic models of infection. 1          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The antibiotic era, stemming from the deployment of penicillin, introduced arguably the most successful medicine of all time, impacting dramatically on life expectancy by decreasing childhood and adult deaths from infections, and enabling complex surgeries, transplantations and cancer chemotherapy.

Consequently, bacteria maintain a nearly constant ratio of major membrane glycerophospholipids. Nevertheless, environmental signals can induce changes in the molar ratio of anionic to zwitterionic phospholipids, raising questions about the physiological roles of regulated changes in headgroup composition. The specific aims of this proposed research investigate whether regulated changes in phospholipid headgroup composition affect activities that involve macromolecular interactions with phospholipids in the Gram-negative pathogen Salmonella enterica using genetic and biochemical approaches. Aim 1 is to engineer Salmonella strains with adjustable phospholipid headgroup compositions. Aim 2 is to examine whether phospholipid composition affects the biochemical properties and sensing capabilities of PhoQ, an integral membrane sensor kinase that utilizes ligand-mediated interactions with anionic phospholipids to detect signals and to respond to low extracytoplasmic Mg2+, the presence of antimicrobial peptides, and acidic pH. Aim 3 is to investigate whether regulated changes in phospholipid composition mediate resistance to magainin 2, a cationic antimicrobial peptide that disrupts membranes to kill bacteria. Independent and parallel approaches will be adopted to address Aims 2 and 3: strains constructed in Aim 1 will be utilized for in vivo experiments, and reconstituted biochemical liposome systems will be utilized for in vitro experiments. Results from these proposed experiments will indicate whether regulated changes in phospholipid headgroup composition modulate the activities of an integral membrane sensor kinase or mediate resistance to a cationic antimicrobial peptide. Accomplishment of these aims will enable genetic investigations of alterations in phospholipid headgroup composition in a human pathogen and will illuminate novel physiological functions for an essential cellular component.

5P01DK035108-27,National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,24,"Constant exposure to harmless food antigens requires that intestinal immune responses are normally biased towards tolerance and development of regulatory T cells, yet infections with intestinal pathogens induce effector T cells and aggressive antimicrobial immune defenses. The mechanisms underlying the differential recognition of harmless food antigens and threatening microbial antigens, and the corresponding immune decision processes, are central to the understanding of mucosal immunity and its exploitation for preventive and therapeutic medical strategies such as vaccination and immunotherapy. The reprogramming from regulatory to effector T cells typically occurs in the context of inflammation initiated by innate recognition of conserved microbial molecules through Toll-like receptors and other innate sensors. However, the host mounts effective immune responses to certain enteric pathogens without mucosal inflammation. An important pathogen of this category is the protozoan parasite, Giardia, which is a major cause of diarrheal disease woridwide. It colonizes the lumen and epithelial surface of the small intestine, and activates effective mucosal immune defenses, but does not invade the mucosa or cause significant inflammation. The overall goal of our studies is to exploit Giardia as a model to elucidate the mechanisms that govern immune decisions in the intestinal tract in the absence of inflammation. The studies have the following Specific Aims: Aim 1. To determine the mechanisms of dendritic cell-dependent immune defense against Giardia. Aim 2. To define the mechanisms of G/ard/a-triggered colitis in suseptible hosts. Aim 3. To investigate the function of IL-17 in giardiasis. The proposed studies will generate important new insights into the immune processes and decisions that take place in the intestinal tract at the interface of local resident cells, innate immune cells, and professional immune cells of the T and B cell lineages in the context of a protozoan infection. Furthermore, the work will provide a basis for the rational design of improved strategies for treating and preventing giardiasis and possibly infection with other clinically important luminal pathogens. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Giardia lamblia, a NIAID/CDC Category B priority pathogen, is a major cause of diarrheal disease woridwide and the leading cause of waterborne disease in the United States.

The broad spectrum of clinically important staphylococcal diseases includes also endocarditis, septic arthritis, toxic shock syndrome, scalded skin syndrome and food poisoning. S. aureus strains exhibiting multiple antibiotic resistances, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), are isolated in up to 60% of community and 80% of hospital infections. 4.6 % of individuals admitted into American hospitals suffer staphylococcal infections, claiming an aggregate mortality of about 100,000 lives this year. Vancomycin and other glycopeptide inhibitors of cell wall synthesis are considered last-resort-therapies for MRSA, however strains with intermediate (VISA) or full resistance (VRSA) to vancomycin have caused infections for which antimicrobial treatment is no longer effective. The search for protective immunity against invasive S. aureus disease has been a goal since the discovery of this microbe. Whole-cell live or killed vaccines, however, failed to generate protective immune responses in humans and, because of safety concerns, are no longer considered for staphylococcal vaccine development. Research conducted under NIAID AI52747 studied the molecular biology of heme-iron scavenging in staphylococci and identified the molecular properties of iron-regulated surface determinants (IsdA-I). Other work sought to develop a broadly protective subunit vaccine by studying surface proteins conserved among different S. aureus strains as antigens in a murine model of abscess formation. Immunization with surface proteins, including the heme-transport proteins IsdA and IsdB, generated significant protective immunity that correlated with the induction of specific antibodies. When assembled into a combined vaccine, the surface protein vaccine afforded high levels of protection against invasive disease or lethal challenge with human clinical S. aureus isolates. This proposal aims to understand the molecular basis of staphylococcal vaccines from surface proteins and to appreciate the function of surface proteins and other secreted polypeptides in animal models of infection. Specifically, the role of heme scavenging in immunity against staphylococcal disease, the molecular biology of staphylococcal immune suppression by SasH, and the contribution of hlb-converting phages towards staphylococcal immune evasion will be investigated.",Vaccine Assembly From Surface Proteins Of Staphylococcus Aureus,2002,2013,"Schneewind, Olaf ",University of Chicago,Chicago,IL,17,1,377,1553
5R21AI094887-02,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Entamoeba histolytica infects over 500 million people annually and is a leading cause of parasitic death in humans. The infectious cycle of E. histolytica begins with the ingestion of the cyst, a non-dividing form that is able to survive in the environment due to a protective cell wall. After ingestion, the cyst travels to the intestine, where it undergoes excystation to produce the proliferative trophozoite form, which is capable of causing disease. Some trophozoites will encyst, allowing them to be excreted and to go on to infect new hosts. Unfortunately, although the developmental cascade is essential to pathogen transmission and disease causation, research into the regulation of this process has been hampered by the lack of a good in vitro system for studying E. histolytica stage conversion. We will take advantage of established methods for inducible encystation and excystation in E. invadens, a reptilian parasite highly related to E. histolytica in which high levels of both processes can be achieved in vitro. We propose to develop a transcriptome of E. invadens during the entire life cycle (encystation and excystation) using deep sequencing of RNA transcripts (RNA-seq). This method takes advantage of next generation sequencing technologies and has previously been used to develop transcriptomes in numerous systems. RNA-seq will be performed for trophozoites, during cyst formation (8, 12, 24 and 48 h), mature cysts (72h), and early (30min, 2h, 8h) and late (48h) excysting parasites. Sequence data will be mapped to the genome and analyzed by bioinformatics methods to identify developmentally regulated genes. Information on gene annotation and alternative splicing can also be gleaned from the RNA-seq approach. Data will be deposited in EuPathDB where it will readily be available to the community.

At a more general level, the Haiti situation provides an ideal setting to monitor the transition from of cholera from epidemic to endemic disease, with a focus on understanding development of environmental reservoirs, routes of transmission, risk factors for illness, and evolutionary changes within the microorganism itself. We would note, in particular, the uniqueness of the situation, with the apparent clonality of the infecting strain providing an opportunity to follow development of strain diversity across time, with a known starting point (October, 2010), in an island setting where there has been no cholera for over 50 years.  To address these issues, we are proposing a series of studies based in the Gressier region of Haiti, where the University of Florida has had ongoing relationships with communities and community leaders for close to 15 years, and where our College of Public Health and Health Professions is completing construction of a microbiology laboratory/research facility. Specific aims of the project will include the following: 1) Identification of V. cholerae in household members and in the environment: this will include surveillance in a school-based cohort of approximately 1,200 households, with follow-up of all diarrheal episodes by culture, and monitoring of all family members (symptomatic and asymptomatic) for a 4 week period after each family index case; and identification and systematic monitoring of household water sources and environmental reservoirs for V. cholerae. 2) Assessment and comparison of evolutionary changes in clinical and environmental V. cholerae isolates, making use of VNTR and whole genome SNP analysis. 3) Further refinement and validation of mathematical models of cholera transmission, including assessments of the impact of immunization and other interventions on transmission. Activities will focus on agent-based simulation models, using data from the field studies in Gressier for calibration. Models will be integrated into public health efforts to anticipate progression and transmission of cholera in Haiti, and the impact of proposed interventions.

NHE3 transports Na+ and H+ under basal conditions, and in the post-prandial state is first inhibited and then stimulated later in digestion. Studies ae proposed based on our findings during the previous funding period that A) A large, multiprotein complex forms on the NHE3 C-terminus acting as a scaffold between aa 586-605 which is necessary for the post-prandial inhibition of NHE3 activity as is mimicked by elevated Ca2+ and cAMP. Proteins shown to be part of this complex include NHERF 1-4, CaMKII, CK2, PLC?, and probably CaM and the complex is dynamic, changing in composition with conditions which mimick the post-prandial state. B) NHE3 is fixed to the microvillar cytoskeleton under basal conditions, but reversibly dissociates with signaling that mimics the post-prandial state. This proposal will increase understanding of the role of this signaling complex in NHE3 regulation and diarrheal diseases by: A) Testing the hypothesis that the NHE3 C-terminal signaling complex is a physiologic and pathophysiologic regulator of NHE3, which can be affected to stimulate NHE3 activity. The role of CaM KII will be studied, which we have shown is part of the signaling complex and which appears to inhibit basal NHE3 activity and to phosphorylate NHE3. Also, a peptide that mimics the part of the NHE3 C-terminus to which the signaling complex attaches can be loaded into cells, and stimulates basal NHE3 activity and reduces Ca2+ and cAMP-induced NHE3 inhibition, including in an in vivo model of cholera. This peptide will be examined for effects on NHE3 regulation in polarized intestinal cells and intact rodent intestine as well as models of acute diarrhea and used to probe biochemically the nature of the NHE3 signaling complex. This peptide may be useful to develop as a drug to treat diarrhea. B) Testing the hypothesis that acute regulation of NHE3 activity involves two separate events: changes in NHE3 trafficking, which has been studied in the past, and the newly recognized dynamic aspects in the NHE3/microvillar cytoskeletal-NHERF2 association. Advanced imaging/confocal microscopy with polarized epithelial cells will determine which NHE3 regulatory processes are associated with freeing up NHE3 from NHERF2 and the microvillar cytoskeleton and determine which steps in signaling are responsible for this dynamic interaction of NHE3 with the microvillar actin cytoskeleton as well as the consequences on regulation of NHE3 activity of disrupting the dissociation, including in in vivo conditions. These studies will provide insights into how this NHE3 signaling complex helps set NHE3 activity under basal and regulated conditions, including in two in vivo diarrhea models; and also how information about this complex can be used translationally to develop drug therapy of diarrhea by stimulating NHE3.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal will increase understanding of acute regulation of the small intestinal brush border Na/H exchanger NHE3, which is the major way Na is absorbed in the intestine and which contributes to abnormal water and Na absorption in most diarrheal diseases. NHE3 is regulated by a large multiprotein complex which forms on its C-terminus. This proposal will examine how this complex accomplishes the regulation, including: A) Determining how calmodulin kinase II, which is part of the complex, inhibits NHE3 activity under basal conditions; B) Defining the effects of a peptide that mimics the part of NHE3 on which the complex forms and which can be loaded into intact cells and small intestine, including in an in vivo mouse jejunal model and models of acute diarrhea; and B) Examining a newly recognized aspect of signal transduction that regulates NHE3, which is dynamic control of the association of NHE3 with NHERF2 and the microvillar cytoskeleton to allow newly trafficked NHE3 to move up and down the microvillus.",Diarrheal Disease: Physiologic Approach To Treatment,1988,2017,"Donowitz, Mark ",Johns Hopkins University,Baltimore,MD,25,1,97,1963
5R01AI085535-04,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Pathogenic bacteria require iron for their survival and ability to cause infection. Heme comprises 90% of the iron available within the host and plays a significant role in the colonization and virulence of many bacterial pathogens. Shigella spp. and enteroinvasive E. coli are responsible for shigellosis in humans, a disease characterized by the destruction of the mucosal layers of the colon. S. dysenteriae is particularly problematic as it produces a more severe form of the disease and is associated with life threatening complications. The recent increase in the emergence of drug resistance has severely limited the choice of antimicrobial agents available. A shift in strategy for antimicrobial development has been to focus on antimicrobial targets that are not essential for bacterial survival, but are required for virulence, thus reducing the selective pressure for development of drug resistance. The ability to acquire iron from the host is one of the most important and well understood determinants of bacterial virulence and pathogenesis. Recently it has been shown in a number of organisms that heme is an essential source of iron during infection and disease progression. Therefore, targeting heme uptake and utilization alone or in combination with other antimicrobial approaches may provide a novel therapeutic strategy. The overall goal of the studies are; i) To characterize the heme uptake proteins utilizing a combination of site-directed mutagenesis, crystallographic and spectroscopic techniques to determine heme binding properties of the heme uptake system. ii) To determine the mechanism of heme transport through the bacterial outer membrane to the cytoplasm utilizing in vitro model systems in proteoliposomes; and iii) to determine the role of the cytoplasmic heme binding protein ShuS in intracellular heme metabolism through proteomic and metabolomic studies. These studies will provide a thorough understanding of the molecular mechanisms of heme uptake and utilization in gram-negative pathogens as a step toward identifying therapeutic targets for future drug design and development.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The need for new therapeutics targeting enteric pathogens such as Shigella dysenteria is a high priority given the increase in resistance to current antibiotics. S. dysenteriae the causative agent of shigellosis, is responsible for 160 million outbreaks per year and has a high rate of morbidity and mortality in developing countries. Of the estimated 1.1 million deaths per year 60% occur in children under the age of 5 years.

Peanut allergy is a severe and potentially fatal immunologic problem affecting approximately 1% of children in the U.S. and other developed nations. Without an effective disease-modifying therapy, patients suffer significant physical and psychological morbidity, including the profound reduction in quality of life that results from an ever-present risk of life-threatening anaphylaxis Based on recent studies highlighting the potential plasticity of allergic responses early in life, and the role of oral exposure during this critical period, we have designed a single-center randomized clinical trial to test early intervention with low-dose and high-dose peanut oral immunotherapy (OIT) in 40 newly diagnosed peanut-allergic children aged 9 - 36 months. The goals of this project are: to produce a new treatment that would rapidly benefit peanut-allergic subjects, by transiently altering reactivity and lowering the risk of anaphylaxis while on treatmen (i.e., desensitization) (Aim I); to assess the ability of this treatment to permanently alter the peanut-specific immune response over time, allowing discontinuation of therapy (i.e., tolerance) (Aim I); and to understand its mechanism of action (Aim II). While providing a mentored training experience in clinical research, this innovative trial focuses directly on several critical knowlede gaps that must be addressed in order to develop the first clinically available food allergy treatment and change the standard of care. The outcome of this work has the potential to change the way peanut allergy is treated, by developing a safe, inexpensive, feasible, and effective disease-modifying therapy that could be made immediately available to infants and toddlers.

8R21GM103535-02,National Institute of General Medical Sciences,93,"The goal of the proposed research is to develop a platform technology for simultaneous detection of multiple analytes with better efficiency and lower cost. Currently, immunoassays are extensively used in biomedical research, clinical diagnostics, food/water safety testing, and biological warfare defense. Although they can be performed in a microplate (e.g. 96 wells) to increase sample throughput, the immunoassay in each well is generally limited to one analyte per test. Such a format is inefficient and not cost-effective for the requirement to detect multiple analytes in a sample. For instance, a spectrum of toxic agents should be simultaneously monitored in foods and drinking water. Similarly, a set of biomarkers, rather than an individual biomarker, should be detected for a particular disease to enhance the accuracy. Therefore, a platform to detect multiple analytes simultaneously is desirable for better efficiency and lower cost. The specific aims of the proposed research are to (1) design and optimize an array of microfluidic valves that are required for containing reagents, directing and regulating flows; (2) demonstrate the microfluidics-enabled multiplexed immunoassay array in the format of sandwich assays and study the effects of surface modification, flow rate, reagent concentration on the assay; and (3) validate the immunoassay array by detecting multiple analytes including toxins and biomarkers. The significance of the research lies in the following aspects. First, the proposed research will lead to a platform for simultaneous detection of multiple analytes. Such a capability will lead to efficient and cost- effective methods. Secondly, the microfluidic-enabled immunoassay array will have shorter analysis time and a reduction in the consumption of required sample and reagents. These advantages could have a significant impact since immunoassays are widely used in chemical, biological and clinical laboratories. Thirdly, the proposed research will result in a manufacturable process that allows mass production of low-cost, disposable devices.

1R01AI098369-01,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Vibrio vulnificus is a natural inhabitant of coastal waters, including the US Gulf. The bacterium causes rapid septicemia after consumption of contaminated seafood (especially raw oysters), predominantly in persons with liver dysfunction. Among food-bourne pathogens, V. vulnificus is most notable for its high rates of hospitalization and death. Indeed, V. vulnificus accounts for 1% of deaths from food-bourne illness despite causing only 0.003% of illnesses. Attempts by the FDA to protect consumers by implementation of post- harvest processing mandates met with significant resistance from the shellfish harvesting industry forcing the FDA to review its policies. Thus, the study of V. vulnificus pathogenesis has become a food safety and public policy priority. Recent studies establish that cytotoxicity of V. vulnificus is predominantly associated with a large Multifunctional-Autoprocessing RTX toxin (MARTXVv). In this study, we demonstrate that this toxin is directly linked to pathogenesis by the intragastric route of infection. We propose to study the role of the MARTXVv toxin in pathogenesis using in vivo, cell culture, and biochemical systems. The focus of the proposal will be mechanisms directly impacting early infection after consumption of contaminated food and identification and characterization of specific regions of the toxin linked to tissue damage and immune system evasion.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Vibrio vulnificus is a bacterium that inhabits the US Gulf and causes sepsis and necrotizing fasciitis (flesh- eating bacteria).

5R01NS056379-05,National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke,96,"Prion diseases are invariably fatal infectious diseases affecting a wide range of animals. These include chronic wating disease (CWD) of deer and elk, scrapie in sheep, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle and Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease and kuru in humans. CWD appears to be especially contagious, with suspected horizontal transfer efficiency reaching 90% and estimates of infection among mule deer populations in Colorado reaching 20%. Possible transfer to humans, as exhibited for BSE, has not been systematically disproven and the accompanying risk to public health remains. Moreover, if left unchecked, the ecologic and economic impact could be devastating. Our long-term goals include developing mouse models of CWD to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in extraneural prion dissemination, accumulation and replication. We also plan to further our understanding of these processes using novel as well as established mouse models of scrapie, with the ultimate goal of developing further CWD models in mice based on these data. Our specific hypothesis states that certain components of the Complement system enable optimal prion capture, replication and neuroinvasion in CWD and scrapie. We derive this hypothesis from 1) previously published data demonstrating that partial or complete depletion of Complement components C1q, C3 and CD21 delays splenic prion accumulation and replication; and impedes or even prevents disease in murine models of scrapie; and 2) previously published data showing significant PrPCWD localization in CD21-expressing lymphoid tissue from deer and 3) our current data that shows murine CD21/35 interacts with PrPSc without its endogenous ligands C3 and C4. We plan to extend this work and initiate new investigations with the following specific aims: 1) Test Complement-deficient Tg(CerPrP) mouse models. 2) Test the horizontal transmissibility of CWD in Tg(cerPrP) mice. 3) Extend our investigation into the role of Complement in peripheral prion pathogenesis using murine scrapie models. Our data strongly suggest that PrPSC can interact with sites on CD21/35 distinct from those that bind C3 cleavage products. We will map these sites by creating CD21/35 truncation mutants and analyzing their ability to bind PrPSc and PrPCWD.

5U01AI082180-04,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Toxoplasma gondii infections cause suffering and mortality in those congenitally infected or immune compromised. Easily genetically manipulated and disseminated in nature, this parasite is considered a category B bioterrorism pathogen. Improved, new antimicrobials are greatly needed to treat this infection. Type 2 fatty acid biosynthesis (fas), structurally different from mammalian type 2 fas, is a validated target essential for Toxoplasma gondii growth in vitro and survival of the parasite in mice. Enoyl reductase (ENR) is an enzyme in the type 2 fas biosynthetic pathway. Triclosan and two newly synthesized lead compounds, in nanomolar amounts, inhibit T. gondii ENR activity and in low micromolar amounts inhibit T. gondii growth in vitro. Triclosan also inhibits T. gondii growth in mice. Structures of T. gondii ENR complexed with inhibitors have been solved. Unique features of T. gondii ENR will be used to develop novel tight binding inhibitors. With these data in hand, and to be acquired during the work proposed, using a structure based design approach, it will be possible to modify and thereby optimize and create a novel tight binding inhibitor of T. gondii ENR. We will create a new compound based on theoretical information derived from analyses of lead inhibitory compounds' and ENR structures and their interactions coupled with enzyme and parasite inhibitory data. Information we have in hand from our preliminary analyses of triclosan and other novel compounds we have synthesized and tested in enzyme, in vitro parasite and co-crystallization and structure analyses will inform this structure-based ENR inhibitor design program. If new leads are needed, as an additional alternative approach, a Catalyst-based pharmacophore approach will be used. Inhibitors will undergo rounds of modification and testing to find more druggable ENR inhibitors with better ADMET profiles. As new inhibitory compounds are identified, their fit to the enzyme binding site will be compared, and hybrid structures that incorporate desirable features from different molecular scaffolds will be created to optimize activity. ClogP, or PSA, and Caco2 cell permeability will be optimized. It is likely that either a completely new molecule will be created or that the phenyl rings of triclosan will be converted to heterocycles having improved solubility, activity, and safety.

1ZIABC010793-06,National Cancer Institute,99,"Progress has been made in several of the aims of the project, in particular on the role of TLR signaling in regulating proliferation and survival of fibroblasts and dendritic cells, on the regulation of cytokine production from human DC, on the role of plasmacytoid DC in regulating oral tolerance, on the effect of DC and NK cells on Th1 differentiation in Toxoplasma Gondii infection, role of TNF, MyD88 and IL-18 in colitis-dependent carcinogenesis.Hepatic plasmacytoid dendritic cells contribute to orally induced CD8+ T cell tolerance (Immunity. 2008; 9:464-75).W have shown that the liver is a site of oral antigen presentation and that hepatic dendritic cells (DC) can tolerize mice to subsequent CD8+ T cell priming, in a model of hapten-specific contact sensitivity (CHS). The tolerogenic potential of liver DC is confined to plasmacytoid DC (pDC), is enhanced by exposure to hapten, and requires CD4+ T cells. Finally, in vivo depletion of pDC abrogated oral tolerance and restored hapten-specific CD8+ T cell and CHS responses. Thus, pDC are tolerogenic and play an essential role in oral tolerance. These studies are now being extended to analyze the role of liver pDC in other model of tolerance and in particular in testing whether pDC are require to induce TNBS tolerance in a model of colitis and carcinogenesis. We have generatd a mouse expressing the human Dyptheria Toxin Receptor and the Green Fluorescent protein specifically on pDC. These mice can be used for the identication and in vivo depletion of pDC and they will be used in  experiments aimed to identify and deplete pDCs in vivo. In addition to the models of oral tolerance we have established that TLR9-activated pDC in the intestinal lamina propria prevent the conversion of naive CD4 T cells in FoxP3+ Treg and we are estending our studies to other models in which pDCs are involved in immunoregulation. Toxoplasma gondii infected TAP1 deficient mice display impaired NK cell IFN-gamma production leading to defective CD4+ T cell priming and increased mortality (J Exp Med. 2007, 204:2591-602).To investigate if TAP1 is required for CD8+ T cell mediated control of Toxoplasma gondii in vivo, we compared the resistance of TAP1-/-, CD8-/- and wild-type (WT) mice to infection with the parasite.  Surprisingly TAP1-/- mice displayed greater susceptibility than either CD8-/- or WT mice to infection with an avirulent parasite strain.  The decreased resistance of the TAP1-/- mice correlated with a reduction in the frequency of activated and IFN-gamma-producing CD4+ T cells.  Interestingly, infected TAP1-/- mice showed a reduced frequency of IFN-gamma producing natural killer (NK) cells relative to that of WT controls, and after NK cell-depletion both CD8-/- and WT mice succumbed to infection with the same kinetics as TAP1-/- animals and displayed impaired CD4+T cell IFN-gamma responses.  Together, these results reveal a previously unappreciated role for TAP1 in the induction of IFN-gamma producing NK cells and provide the first demonstration of the function of this cell population in the priming of CD4+ T lymphocyte responses to T. gondii infection. We are completing the analysis of the cell types responsible for IL-12 production in peritoneal T. gondii infection. It has been known for long time that the major DC population able to produce IL-12 in response to T. gondii soluble extract, or the molecule profilin contained in it, are CD8alpha+ DC that are able to respond to profilin through TLR11 in an IFN-gamma independent fashion . However, we determined that during peritoneal infection with T. gondii, the dominant IL-12 producing cells are CD11b+ CD11c+ DC derived from peripheral monocytes that require priming by IFN-gamma produced by resident NK cells. Cell transfer experiments have allowed us to demonstrate that upon infection, the major peritoneal macrophage populations disappear while NK cells remain in the peritoneal cavity and are activated to produce IFN-gamma that primes monocyte-derived DC immigrating from the peripheral circulation for IL-12 production.Innate resistance and pro-inflammatory cytokines in carcinogenesis.A very extensive investigation has been initiated to study the role of inflammatory receptors and cytokines in skin and colon chemical carcinogenesis. Signaling through the adaptor protein MyD88 promotes carcinogenesis in several cancer models. In contrast, MyD88 signaling has a protective role in the development of azoxymethane (AOM)/ dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) colitis-associated cancer (CAC). The inability of Myd88-/- mice to heal ulcers generated upon injury creates an altered inflammatory environment that induces early alterations in expression of genes encoding pro-inflammatory factors as well as pathways regulating cell proliferation, apoptosis, and DNA repair resulting in a dramatic increase in adenoma formation and progression to infiltrating adenocarcinomas with frequent clonal mutations in the beta-catenin gene. Others have reported that Tlr4 deficient mice have a similar susceptibility to colitis as Myd88 deficient mice but, unlike the latter, are resistant to CAC. We have observed that mice deficient for Tlr2 or IlL1Rr do not show a differential susceptibility to colitis or CAC. However, upon AOM/DSS treatment Il18-/- and Il18r1-/- mice were more susceptible to colitis and polyp formation than wild type mice, suggesting that the phenotype of Myd88 -/- mice is in part due to their inability to signal through the IL-18 receptor.  This study revealed a previously unknown level of complexity surrounding MyD88 activities downstream of different receptors that impact tissue homeostasis and carcinogenesis.Constitutively active RAS plays a central role in the development of skin cancer in the classical two stage skin carcinogenesis in mice and in a number of human cancers. Ras mediated tumor formation is commonly associated with upregulation of cytokines and chemokines that mediate an inflammatory response considered relevant to oncogenesis. MyD88 is a crucial intermediate in the expression of multiple innate immune responders through signaling from the Toll-like/IL-1R family. We report that mice ablated for MyD88 or the IL-1R are resistant to topical skin carcinogenesis, and cultured MyD88-/- keratinocytes transduced with an oncogenic ras vector form only a few small tumors in orthotopic grafts. Initiated keratinocytes arising from oncogenic activation of Ras mimic the phenotype of in vivo induced skin tumors and are hyperproliferative but also resist signals for induced differentiation and upregulate cytokine, chemokine, and metalloprotease genes that in vivo mediate an inflammatory response considered relevant to oncogenesis.  Oncogenic Ras transduced MyD88-/- keratinocytes are also hyperproliferative but the differentiation response is intact and pro-inflammatory genes are not upregulated. Using both genetic and pharmacological approaches, we find that in keratinocytes, the differentiation and pro-inflammatory functions mediated by oncogenic ras require the establishment of an autocrine loop through IL-1alpha and its receptor leading to NF-kB activation. In the absence of MyD88 or IL-1R, this loop cannot be established. Further, blocking the IL-1alpha mediated NF-kB activation in ras-transduced wildtype keratinocytes corrects the defect in differentiation response and inhibits proinflammatory gene expression.  Collectively, these results demonstrate that Ras activation converts normal keratinocytes to an initiated phenotype through a series of potentially reversible feedback signals that provide therapeutic opportunities through inhibition of IL-1 signaling.","Role Of Inflammation, Innate Resistance, And Immunity In Carcinogenesis.",,,"Trinchieri, Giorgio ",Basic Sciences,,,-1,,-1,-1

Key virulence factors of V. cholerae and ETEC are, respectively, cholera toxin (CT) and Heat-labile Enterotoxin (LT), two closely related and sophisticated hetero-hexameric AB5 toxins. Our investigations aim to answer a series of crucial and unresolved questions concerning the mechanism of toxin secretion across the outer membrane of V. cholerae and ETEC. The proposed research uses crystallographic approaches, complemented by electron microscopy and small angle X-ray scattering studies, to unravel the architecture and functioning of the fascinating bacterial Type 2 Secretion System (T2SS) at the atomic level. The T2SS is responsible for secretion of LT and CT, and a host of other proteins, from the periplasm into the extracellular milieu. A remarkable property of the T2SS is its capability to translocate proteins in folded form across the outer membrane. Determining the three-dimensional structure of the large T2SS is a formidable challenge since this system contains multiple copies of at least 11 different proteins and spans two membrane bilayers. The T2SS occurs in numerous pathogenic bacteria attacking humans, animals and plants. Understanding the T2SS is of extra importance since it is related to the Type 4 Pilin Biogenesis System, which also is occurring in many pathogens and is responsible for a diversity of processes, like protein secretion, protein import and DNA uptake. Given the sophistication of the bacterial toxins and the T2SS secretion system, and their wide-spread occurrence in harmful bacteria, our studies will substantially increase the fundamental scientific knowledge of bacterial pathogenesis. At the same time, our structural data will provide a new basis for developing future therapeutic interventions against bacterial infections. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many pathogenic bacteria secrete toxins to cause human cells to malfunction, often with disastrous consequences for the human host.

1R01AI100741-01,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Human Cryptosporidium (Cr.) transmission has been thought to occur only via fecal-oral, water-, or food-borne routes. We recently found that 35% of Ugandan children with Cr. diarrhea and cough were PCR sputum-positive, suggesting that respiratory tract (RT) infection occurs frequently in children with Cr. infection (R21AI 068474). This suggests that Cr. transmission may occur via aerosols or respiratory droplets ejected during coughing. Using linked hospital and household studies, we will assess the clinical and public health significance of RT infection. We hypothesize that RT infection has clinical sequelae; and that prior exposure to Cr. may limit RT infection, in contrast to malnutrition or HIV  which may facilitate or worsen clinical RT infection. Further, we surmise that parasite species affects the propensity for RT infection. Finally, we hypothesize that children with RT infection have increased propensity for transmission of Cr. to others.  Aim 1 is a hospital-based study that will assess severity of RT illness and possible modifying factors. We will enroll Ugandan children aged 9-36 months who (Group A) have primary diarrhea and unexplained cough or tachypnea; or (Group B) primary clinical pneumonia with or without diarrhea. The respiratory status of all children will be rigorously assessed, including pulse oximetry. Both groups will be screened for Cr. in the stool, and eligibility for sputum induction after clinical and laboratory testing affirms the procedure can be safely performed. Prior Cr. exposure will be judged via two novel immunological methods, salivary antibody to gp15 and an indirect immunofluorescence assay against replicating Cr. grown in vitro. Nutritional status will be gauged via anthropometrics, hemoglobin, and serum albumin. HIV testing, if consented to, will be performed. Sputum isolates of Cr. will be speciated via RFLP analysis. Concurrent RT infections will be exhaustively assessed by standard microbiology, multiplex PCR, and staining for HIV-related organisms. Children identified in Aim 1 will then serve as index children for household transmission studies under Aim 2A. We will visit households of index children to characterize the clinical history, enteric and RT Cr. status, and exposure history (with salivary antibody to gp  15) of household members, at the time of presentation of the index child and 2 weeks later. We will then compare transmission rates in households of children with and without RT Cr. infection in both a retrospective and prospective fashion. To address the hypothesis that adults with RT Cr. could act as agents of transmission, under Aim 2B we will establish whether there is any evidence of RT Cr. in adults using an inexpensive, efficient approach testing thousands of specimens - by re-screening sputa collected for tuberculosis testing for Cr. This group is enriched with persons with HIV.  Public health relevance: Cryptosporidium commonly causes diarrhea which can be fatal. We wish to see if it can be spread from, or to, the lungs, like influenza or tuberculosis. If it can spread in this way, then we can prevent people from getting infected by actions such as wearing masks and washing hands after coughing.

The significance of this proposal is based on our landmark studies that have examined the effects of peanut oral immunotherapy (OIT) showing a substantial increase in the amount of peanut that a peanut allergic patient can ingest while on therapy (desensitization) and in some cases causing long-term clinical tolerance when the therapy is discontinued. We have identified initial changes in basophil/mast cell reactivity, antigen-specific T cell responses and systemic humoral immune responses in these subjects. Our hypothesis is that peanut OIT will alter the early signaling pathways of basophils/mast cells causing clinical desensitization and then clinical tolerance will develop because of the interrelated changes in allergen-specific T- and B-cells. The long-term goal of this proposal is to better understand the mechanism of the development of oral tolerance to foods in young children treated with allergen immunotherapy. To accomplish this goal our specific aims are the following: Aim 1: Determine the mechanism(s) by which OIT induces hyporesponsiveness in basophils/mast cells in peanut allergic subjects on peanut OIT, Aim 2: Determine the peanut allergen-specific CD4+ T cell frequencies and phenotypes, as well as the suppressive function of Treg cells, that are associated with the development of clinical tolerance to peanuts, Aim 3: Determine the effect of peanut-specific mucosal and systemic humoral immune responses in OIT on clinical tolerance. The studies will help us identify the mechanism and durability of the desensitized state and then the development of tolerance to foods after OIT. A treatment for peanut allergy is critically needed, the completion of these studies will provide a strong scientific basis for the development of OIT and other types of therapy that hope to produce long-term clinical tolerance to peanuts and other foods.            PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Food allergy, an aberration of oral tolerance, occurs in 6% of children and 3.5% of adults in the United States.

5P01HL057346-14,"National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute",98,"Seeinstructions): The widespread occurrence of antibiotic resistance among bacteria is causing increasing concern as a major threat to public health. Current antibiotics cause death or growth arrest in the target bacteria. As a result, antibiotic use exerts strong selective pressure to favor antibiotic resistant strains. Novel antimicrobial reagents that suppress pathogen virulence without selecting for antibiotic resistance provide a promising alternative approach for treatment of infectious diseases. Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is an important human pathogen affecting millions of people globally each year. The streptokinase (SK) is a major GAS virulence factor that activates human plasminogen. In our previous studies, we have established the streptokinase/plasminogen interaction as a critical factor in GAS pathogenesis. We propose to take advantage of this observation and design novel antimicrobial reagents for the treatment of GAS infection. In the preliminary study, we has screened 55,000 small compounds for inhibitors of SK expression and 20 candidate hit compounds have been identified. In specific aim I, the candidate compounds will befurther characterized and optimized to generate proper SK expression inhibitors for studying the roles of SK in GAS virulence. An additional high throughput screen of up to 500,000 more small compounds will be performed by taking advantage of the NIH Molecular Libraries and Imaging roadmap initiative. In specific aim II, Global effects of candidate compounds on GAS gene expressionwill be studied to provide clues for identification of the targets. GAS two-component system FasBCAX that has been demonstrated to regulate SK expression in published reports will be tested as prime candidate targets. In specific aim III,a number of murine GAS infection models established in our preliminary studies will be used to elucidate the effects of candidate compounds on GAS virulence in vivo. Data collected from the above studies will further our understanding of the contribution of SK to GAS infection and identify small compounds that can inhibit GAS virulence. As a result, alternative approach to treat bacterial infection by interfering with GAS virulence without unduly introducing selection pressure for resistance can be exploredto supplement antibiotic treatment. RELEVANCE (Seeinstructions): Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is an important human pathogen infecting millions of people. Streptokinase (SK) is one of the major GAS virulence factors. The overall objective of this proposal is to screen for small compounds to inhibit SK expression and explore these compounds both as tools to study GAS pathogenesis and as novel therapeutic reagents for treating GAS infections to supplement antibiotic treatment.",Thrombosis And Hemostasis In Host Defense From Bacterial Infection,,,"Sun, Hongmin ",University of Michigan,Ann Arbor,MI,27,1,200,3829
5R43AI092964-02,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"The botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) are the most poisonous biological substances known. The lethal intravenous dose of BoNT serotype A (BoNT/A) in humans is 1-5 ng/kg. If accidental exposure to BoNT occurs (e.g., from contaminated foodstuffs), loss of life or life-threatening paralysis can occur. Most importantly, the BoNTs have already been weaponized in a highly toxic aerosol form, and they consequently pose a significant threat to both civilian and military populations. Once ingested, BoNTs target the peripheral cholinergic nerve endings and cause death by interrupting autonomic nerve function. The zinc-dependent endopeptidase light chain (LC) portion of BoNTs impairs neuronal exocytosis through proteolysis of essential SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) components of neurotransmission.  The overall goal or this project is to develop small molecule inhibitors of the BoNT/A light chain (LC) metalloprotease activity to treat botulinum poisoning. Our strategy is to optimize a novel chemotype of BoNT/A LC inhibitors to improve potency, selectivity, and drug-like properties. In preliminary studies, we refined the structures to provide a new starting point for medicinal chemistry based on a chemical core with more drug-like properties than the original compound series and with ten-fold better potency. Significant activity was also observed in a chick neuronal cell model of BoNT/A intoxication. These validated early lead compounds are more suitable lead compounds for BoNT/A inhibitor drug discovery than were the original series, and they form the basis for this optimization program to generate an advanced lead compound.  Our approach in Phase I is to use proven techniques of medicinal and parallel synthetic chemistry to optimize the potency and selectivity of the lead series of compounds and produce drug-like molecules with the potential to advance to pre-clinical development. In an iterative process, we will probe these focused compound libraries for structural features that contribute to tighter binding and more potent inhibition of the BoNT/A metalloprotease by measuring the enzymatic and cellular activities, as well as the specificity of the enzyme inhibitors. We will correlate the in vitro activity of the compounds against BoNT/A LC with activity in a cellular model of BoNT/A action, and use the most promising members of the series to validate the inhibitors in an in vivo mouse model of BoNT/A intoxication. At the end of Phase I we will define an advanced lead compound, which will be selected from the group of in vivo-validated inhibitors that displays suitable in vitro pharmacokinetic properties for further preclinical development. In Phase II, we will further optimize and evaluate the lead for in vivo efficacy, pharmacokinetic properties, toxicity and safety pharmacology in two species, and develop it into a pre-IND clinical candidate, suitable for human clinical trials (Phase III).

5R01EY018341-04,National Eye Institute,106,"Toxoplasma gondii is the most common cause of retinochoroiditis in the world. Ocular toxoplasmosis relapses despite the use of antibiotics and remains an important cause of loss of visual acuity especially in children with congenital infection as well as the elderly and the immunosuppressed. Unfortunately, our understanding of the mechanisms of protection against ocular toxoplasmosis is fragmentary. Macrophages, microglia and T cells are the major components of the cell infiltrates in ocular toxoplasmosis. An important event in the interaction between these cells is the stimulation of CD40 expressed on macrophages/microglia. We identified a new paradigm by which the immune system through CD40 kills T. gondii. CD40 induces toxoplasmacidal activity in macrophages and retinal microglia. This is dependent on autophagy, a process that targets the parasite to lysosomal degradation. This finding is likely key to ocular toxoplasmosis because in vivo control of this disease requires CD40. Thus, studying the regulation of CD40-induced autophagy will likely identify new molecular targets for eradication of T. gondii and for therapy of ocular toxoplasmosis that will hopefully prevent relapse of this disease. The objective of this application is to understand how CD40 signaling in macrophages and retinal microglia controls ocular toxoplasmosis and how T. gondii subverts these signals. The central hypothesis for the proposed research is that, CD40 mediates resistance against toxoplasmosis in the eye through protein kinase activation and induction of autophagy. In contrast, T. gondii and cytokines triggered by the parasite use a strategy to impair the signaling needed for optimal activation of autophagy allowing the parasite to evade eradication. This hypothesis will be tested using immunochemical studies as well as genetic approaches that block specific vesicular trafficking molecules. In the first specific aim we will determine if autophagy and protein kinase activation induced by CD40 mediate resistance to ocular toxoplasmosis. In the second aim, we will identify the intracellular events by which cytokines prevent optimal induction of autophagy and test whether inhibition of these events improves control of ocular toxoplasmosis. The proposed work may lead to new strategies to eradicate T. gondii and treat ocular toxoplasmosis based on modulation autophagy and/or CD40 signaling. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Toxoplasmosis of the eye is a relapsing disease and a major cause of visual loss. Currently available therapeutic regimens do not prevent relapse of this disease.

5U19AI044236-14,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"The nature of the normal response to orally administered compounds is one of tolerance or an active nonresponse  to Ags. While there are many ways to achieve this tolerant state, several diseases appear to result  when these mechanisms fail. Food allergy is one such manifestation resulting from the failure of normal  tolerance to occur. Two phases of this response exist: the first where sensitization to the Ag occurs (with the  induction of IgE) and second when re-exposure results in the symptoms of the allergic response. Since the  second event occurs quite rapidly the defects in tolerance that exist in food allergy likely occur at the  sensitizing phase of the response. The Ag itself also plays a role. Of all the Ags ingested orally only a very  small number account for food allergy. We therefore ask what makes an Ag a food allergen? The same  foods processed differently can either induce or protect from food allergy (dry roasted vs boiled peanuts) but  are these processes are more important for sensitization or the actual allergic response. In the last granting  period we looked at distinct milk Ags for their ability to sensitize vs. trigger an anaphylactic response in a  murine model of milk induced anaphylaxis. Soluble proteins (ALA, BLG) are largely taken up by small  intestinal absorptive epithelium. Casein, which exists in a micellular (aggregated) form is a potent inducer of  an IgE response and is taken up by M cells overlying PPs. Interestingly aggregation of ALA and BLG (via  pasteurization) alters the pathway of uptake (from I EC to M cell) and this change is associated with an  increase in immunogenicity and IgE induction but a decreased ability to trigger the actual anaphylactic  response. We have proposed a model whereby sensitization to food allergens occurs via Ag sampling in PPs  whereas the actual triggering of anaphylaxis favors soluble Ags that undergo transepithelial transport. We  have developed a unique intestinal loop model, where loops containing either PPs or lECs only (without  interdigitating DCs) are fashioned. We have shown that tolerance can be induced via peptide (or protein  fragment) administration into either loop and that low dose (regulatory) tolerance can be induced with  peptides specific for either CD4 or CD8+ T cells (OVA323-339 vs SIINFEKL respectively). In this next  granting period we propose to analyze the components of tolerance vs induction of an allergic response by  both clarifying the role of the Ag and the nature of the immune response generated. These studies will be  performed in concert with studies in Project 1 and 2 (the effect and trafficking of baked milk proteins and IEC  transepithelial transport via CD23). We will accomplish these goals by Aim #1. Determine whether the route  of sensitization plays a critical role in the subsequent development of an allergic response to milk allergens.

5R01AI064671-07,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Apicomplexa are responsible for a number of important human diseases including malaria, toxoplasmosis, cryptosporidiosis and cyclosporidiosis. Management of these diseases rests heavily on chemotherapy but anti-parasitic drug treatment faces multiple challenges. These include poor overall potency, restriction to certain life-cycle stages, unwanted side effects, and rapidly emerging multiple drug resistance. A constant stream of new drugs and potential drug targets is required to stay abreast of the threat posed by these pathogens. One of the most promising sources of such parasite specific targets is the apicomplexan plastid or apicoplast. The apicoplast is unique to the parasite and its function is essential to parasite survival. This organelle is a holdover from a free-living photosynthetic past. The structure and biology of the apicoplast is remarkably complex as it is derived from the endosymbiotic marriage of two eukaryotes: a red alga and an auxotrophic protist. The goal of this application is to unravel the complexity of this biology in mechanistic detail and to identify future targets for intervention. Using Toxoplasma as a model organism we will conduct genetic, cell biological and biochemical approaches to characterize the function of two pathways that unfold in the outer compartments of the organelle and that we hypothesize are essential to the organelle and the parasites. We will complement this focused approach with a broader effort to define a comprehensive set of plastid proteins to continue to feed a pipeline of hypothesis-driven mechanistic experiments with strong candidate genes.

The reasons for this increase are unknown, but it is clear  that current strategies for preventing the development of peanut allergy and the severe allergic reactions  following accidental ingestion of peanuts are not effective. Similarly, eosinophilic esophagitis (EE), primarily  a food hypersensitivity disorder in children, has increased in prevalence, its underlying mechanisms are  poorly understood and efforts at prevention and treatment are unsatisfactory.  Five years ago a Consortium consisting of investigators from five universities was formed to investigate  the natural history and underlying immunologic mechanisms of IgE-mediated milk, egg and peanut allergy,  and to test the efficacy of a novel recombinant peanut protein vaccine, EMP-123. In order to accomplish  these objectives, a well-defined administrative structure was established. Although production issues  delayed the availability of EMP-123, the Administrative Core was able to effectively directe the observational  study and initiated 3 immunotherapeutic trials. In the expanded Consortium proposed here, the  Administrative Core will continue to coordinate and facilitate interactions between study sites, the NIAID and  SACC, and to optimize efforts to investigate basic immunologic mechanisms associated with the natural  history of food allergy in our well established cohort, complete a Peanut SLIT trial underway, and evaluate  the efficacy of two additional therapeutic strategies. With the addition of a new site, the Administrative Core  will direct efforts to investigate the role of food allergy in EE, comparing and contrasting the natural history  and immunologic and genetic markers of EE with those of IgE-mediated food allergy.

1F31NS080561-01,National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke,96,"Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular protozoan pathogen with broad host range and tissue trophism. Unlike vertebrate cells, which are capable of de novo adenosine synthesis, T. gondii must rely solely on the purine salvage pathway, necessitating the presence of host-generated adenosine. Limiting access to adenosine may thus affect T. gondii survival or virulence and serve as a potential therapeutic target. CD73, present on vertebrate host cells but not T. gondii parasites, is a surface-anchored glycoprotein that catalyses the conversion of AMP to adenosine, which is then sensed by the cell through transmembrane adenosine receptors. The enzyme is highly expressed on endothelial cells, epithelial cells and lymphocytes. To determine the role of CD73 in T. gondii infection, we infected wild type and CD73- knockout mice with the Toxoplasma gondii ME49 strain via the oral route. We found that while CD73-/- mice were protected from acute T. gondii oral infection, the most significant impact of CD73 was in the CNS, with strikingly attenuated chronic stage infection, (CD73-/- mice did not succumb to reactivation of infection and developed fewer brain cysts). To further investigate the reason for the reduced parasite burden in the CNS, we inoculated WT and CD73-/- mice with T. gondii via peritoneal inoculation. Unexpectedly, CD73-/- mice were markedly susceptible to T. gondii intraperitoneal infection. Our overall hypotheses are that: a) CD73 and CD73-generated adenosine is required for survival or differentiation of T. gondii in the CNS; and b) that CD73 is critical for peritoneal immune regulation in response to local infection. To test these hypotheses, we will study differentiation of T. gondii in CD73-deficient hosts compared to wild type mice (Aim 1). In Aim 2, we will determine the role of CD73 in acute peritoneal infection with T. gondii.

She is now in a period of extended research training in the Division of Infectious Diseases at the Massachusetts General Hospital, and plans to pursue a career as an independent biomedical investigator focused on mucosal and enteric infections of import in resource-limited areas of the world. This application proposes a five-year K08 training program under the primary mentorship of Dr. Edward T. Ryan in the Division of Infectious Disease of the Massachusetts General Hospital. Dr. Stephen B. Calderwood, within the same division, will provide co-mentorship throughout the course of the proposed program. The program involves both didactic and practical training focused on high-throughput immuno-proteomic approaches, and builds upon ongoing collaborations with the International Center for Diarrheal Disease Research, Bangladesh (ICDDR,B), Harvard Institute of Proteomics, and Arizona State University.      The major project focus will be the application of immuno-proteomics to the study of protective immunity in human cholera infection, an infection that remains endemic in over 50 countries. An estimated 3-5 million individuals develop cholera each year, resulting in approximately 100,000 deaths. Although cholera vaccines do induce a protective immune response, immunity is short-lived, lasting approximately 6-24 months. In comparison, natural infection with cholera results in protective immunity that lasts years or decades; however, the mediators of the protective immune response to cholera are poorly understood. In this application, the trainee will use a high-throughput protein-based platform, the Nucleic Acid Programmable Protein Array, to (1) characterize serum anti-V. cholerae immune responses in cholera patients and vaccinees, and correlate baseline serum humoral anti-V. cholerae immunity with protection from disease in household contacts of cholera patients; (2) characterize mucosal anti-V. cholerae immune response, using the antibody-in lymphocyte (ALS ) assay, a marker of mucosal immunity, and (3) characterize anti-V. cholerae memory B cell responses during human wild-type V. cholerae infection, and correlate anti-V. cholerae memory B cell immunity with protection from disease in household contacts of cholera patients. Antigens identified by high throughput screening will then be examined in more detail, including in immunologic confirmatory studies. The results of these studies could provide important insights into protective immunity of human cholera infection, and could lead to improved vaccination strategies against cholera.

CD4+ memory T cells are part of the host's immune system that responds more quickly and strongly to the second exposure to a foreign antigen than it did to the first. During the last funding period we developed a sensitive new technique to track polyclonal peptide major histocompatibility complex class II molecule (pMHCII)-specific CD4+ T cells in normal mice and used it to study immune memory induced by bacterial infection. We found that acute infection with an attenuated strain of Listeria monocytogenes (LM) generated T-bet+ IFN-3-producing Th1 cells, a novel population of Tbet- cells of unknown function that depended on an unknown signal from B cells, and follicular helper cells (Tfh) that depended on pMHCII presentation by B cells. The Th1 cells and T-bet- cells became memory cells but the Tfh cells did not. In contrast, persistent infection with Salmonella typhimurium (ST) induced only T-bet+ cells, which were more stable and contained more multifunctional cells capable of making IFN- 3 and TNF than memory cells induced by acute LM infection. The goal of the current project is to understand how the CD4+ memory T cell subsets induced by these infections are generated and provide protective immunity. LM infection will be studied to determine how the T-bet- memory cells are generated, whether they are what have historically been called central memory cells, and how they help B cells and CD8+ T cells during the secondary immune response. This research is significant because it could give clues about how to improve vaccines against acute infections. ST infection will be studied with the goal of identifying which variety of CD4+ T cell is needed to control infections that threaten the lives of AIDS patients, determine how these cells are generated and provide protection, and ascertain whether they can ever become truly long-lived memory cells. This research is significant because it could fill the knowledge gap that currently prevents creation of more effective T cell-mediated vaccines. This research is innovative because it will employ novel technology to track the endogenous polyclonal CD4+ T cell response during infection, and because it is based on the new ideas that anatomically confined chronic pMHCII presentation without the involvement of B cells is the best way to generate multifunctional CD4+ T cells capable of controlling intracellular bacterial infections.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project focuses on a significant lymphocyte population and an important infection for which a vaccine capable of conferring long-term protection in humans does not exist.

5R01AI091845-03,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Vibrio cholerae is a facultative human pathogen that causes the severe diarrheal disease cholera. The ability of V. cholerae to cause disease is dependent upon the regulated expression of virulence factors. For example, the virulence genes encoding for production of cholera toxin and the toxin coregulated pilus appear to be induced early in infection and repressed late in infection before exiting the human gastrointestinal tract. Other genes that are induced late during infection are believed to be important for the establishment of the hyperinfective phenotype exhibited by human shed vibrios, and for survival in the aquatic ecosystem. The mechanisms that control gene expression in vivo are largely unknown. Quorum sensing has been proposed as one potential mechanism to govern late gene expression in vivo. However, the observation that many epidemic V. cholerae strains are quorum sensing insensitive suggests that other regulatory mechanisms must exist. Our laboratory has shown that diketopiperazines inhibit virulence factor production in V. cholerae. In this grant we will test the hypothesis that cyclo(Phe-Pro), a natural diketopiperazine produced by V. cholerae, functions as a signal to modulate virulence gene expression independent of the known quorum sensing systems.

The WHO has designated arsenic in drinking water in Bangladesh as the largest mass poisoning event in human history. In addition to toxicity due to water arsenic contamination, millions of Bangladeshis may also be exposed to unsafe levels of other toxic metals including lead, nickel, manganese, uranium and chromium. Evidence suggests that much like arsenic, these toxic metals may contribute to adverse health outcomes including cancer risk, reproductive health outcomes, and cardiac and respiratory health. Additionally, despite the promotion of use of safe water sources, water-related diseases remain an important cause of mortality and morbidity in Bangladesh, some of the most common water related diseases being typhoid fever, bacillary dysentery, and diarrhea.

3R01AI065539-06S1,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Campylobacter jejuni is a leading cause of gastroenteritis in humans in the United States and in other countries throughout the world. According to the Centers for Disease Control, C. jejuni competes with Salmonella species as the leading cause of bacterial gastroenteritis in the United States. In contrast, C. jejuni is a common commensal organism of the gastrointestinal tracts of wild and agriculturally-important animals, which contributes to the large amount of C. jejuni found in the human food supply leading to sporadic cases of disease. Flagellar motility is the only proven virulence and colonization factor of C. jejuni, required to promote infection of humans and avian species for the development of disease or commensalism. C. jejuni produces a single flagellum at one or both poles of the bacterium. Thus, C. jejuni belongs to a significant group of bacterial pathogens, such as Vibrio, Pseudomonas, and Helicobacter species, that are programmed to produce a limited number of flagella and place these organelles only at the poles, unlike more commonly studied peritrichous bacteria such as E. coli and Salmonella species. We have used C. jejuni as a model system to understand regulation of flagellar gene expression and biosynthesis in polarly-flagellated bacterial pathogens. This regulatory system requires the flagellar export apparatus, the FlgSR two-component system and the FlhF GTPase for expression C54-dependent flagellar genes. In addition, FlhF and the putative ATP- binding protein, FlhG, are required for proper flagellar placement, number, or biosynthesis with FlhG possessing an additional function in septation. The objectives of this proposal are to analyze signaling processes in C. jejuni that mediate proper expression of flagellar genes while using the flagellar regulatory system to promote a deeper understanding into the cellular biology of signaling networks, complex organelle development, and bacterial septation. In Aim 1, we will analyze a novel signaling mechanism occurring between the flagellar export apparatus and the FlgS sensor kinase that leads to activation of the FlgSR system. In Aim 2, we will analyze the biology of FlgR, an NtrC-like protein, which contains a unique C- terminus that allows for a likely alternative mechanism of signal transduction and transcriptional initiation. In Aim 3, we will analyze how FlhF influences flagellar gene expression and biosynthesis and the dual functions of FlhG in controlling polar flagellar number and septation. Accomplishment of these aims will aid in understanding: 1) a unique molecular mechanism of signaling between protein systems in bacteria; 2) alternative mechanisms of transcriptional initiation for an NtrC-like protein; 3) how signaling networks in bacteria are insulated from each other to mediate specificity of signaling; 4) complex organelle development; and 5) aspects of bacterial septation.",Campylbacter Jejuni Flagellar Regulation And Synthesis,2011,2016,"Hendrixson, David R",Ut Southwestern Medical Center,Dallas,TX,51,1,-1,2944
5R01AI080705-03,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Salmonella cause 1.4 million cases of gastroenteritis and enteric fever per year in the US and lead all other foodborne bacterial pathogens as a cause of death. A prerequisite for Salmonella to cause both intestinal and systemic disease is the direct injection of effector proteins into host intestinal epithelial cells via a Type Three Secretion System (T3SS) encoded on Salmonella Pathogenicity Island 1 (SPI1). These effector proteins induce inflammatory diarrhea and bacterial invasion. Expression of the SPI1 T3SS is tightly regulated in response to environmental signals from a variety of global regulatory systems. Our long term goal is to obtain a comprehensive understanding of how the signal transduction pathways that control the SPI1 T3SS are integrated during the infection process. Extensive genetic analysis has allowed us to formulate a new model for the SPI1 regulatory circuit in which the three AraC-like regulators HilD, HilC, and RtsA act in a complex feed-forward regulatory loop to control expression of hilA, encoding the direct regulator of the SPI1 structural genes. We hypothesize that regulatory signals feed into the system primarily via post-translational control of HilD, which in turn activates hilC, rtsA, and hilA. But how these regulatory systems control HilD is unknown. The flagellar protein FliZ and the protein HilE independently control HilD at the protein level, most likely via protein-protein interaction with the N-terminal domain of HilD. As these represent proximal regulatory inputs, we focus on understanding how FliZ and HilE control HilD function. The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1. Determine how FliZ and HilE act to control HilD activity. Biochemical and genetic experiments will dissect each step in HilD activation of hilA to determine how FliZ and HilE act to control HilD function or stability. 2. Characterize the nature of the interaction between HilD and HilE or FliZ. Co-immunoprecipation and two-hybrid analysis will be used to characterize HilE-HilD and FliZ-HilD interactions. HilD point mutations that negate regulation will be used to identify regions of HilD that are specifically required for HilE- or FliZ-dependent regulation. These mutants will also allow us to test the role of FliZ- and HilE-dependent regulation of SPI1 during intestinal invasion. 3. Determine the signal transduction pathways that feed into HilD to control the SPI1 T3SS. Known regulatory systems that control SPI1 T3SS expression will be screened for those that function through HilD. Mass spectrometry and two-hybrid analysis will be used to identify additional factors that interact with HilD protein. Characterization of these factors will lead to our overall understanding of global signal transduction. The regulation of the SP1 T3SS serves as a paradigm for the integration of host environmental signals to control virulence gene expression and analysis of this system is critical to our understanding of this Class B priority pathogen.

Our understanding of the complex mechanisms required for bacterial survival and multiplication throughout foodborne transmission, including in stressful environments prior to infection (e.g., in foods), as well as those encountered in the host (e.g., in the gastrointestinal tract), is limited. Therefore, the long-term objective of this project is to use L. monocytogenes as a model system for exploring mechanisms that contribute to foodborne pathogen transmission and infection, with the goal of reducing the overall public health burden of foodborne diseases. Preliminary data suggest that multiple regulatory elements function in concert to control gene transcription under rapidly changing conditions such as those encountered during foodborne transmission. Thus, the work proposed in this application will test the following hypotheses: (i) networks among key L. monocytogenes regulatory proteins (e.g., PrfA and different alternative C factors, including CB) are necessary for appropriate expression of genes critical for pathogen transmission and virulence in extra- and intra-host environments; and (ii) multiple regulatory networks and stress response systems contribute to gastrointestinal survival and pathogenesis. These hypotheses will be tested through the following five specific aims: (1) Define regulons controlled by the L. monocytogenes alternative sigma factors using full genome microarrays. (2) Identify L. monocytogenes proteins that co-regulate genes contributing to transmission and virulence using selected mutant bacterial strains, microarrays, qRT-PCR and bioinformatics strategies. (3) Characterize global L. monocytogenes gene expression patterns under different environmental stress conditions and in selected intracellular and intra-host environments using microarrays and qRT-PCR. (4) Develop a WWW-based database of L. monocytogenes microarray data and transcriptional profiles. (5) Characterize stress response and virulence phenotypes of L. monocytogenes with mutations in selected genes encoding regulatory proteins and in selected genes regulated or co-regulated by alternative C factors and other transcriptional regulators. Overall, the proposed studies will provide an improved understanding of the mechanisms used by foodborne pathogens to regulate gene expression under rapidly changing environmental stress conditions encountered during transmission and infection. We anticipate that this knowledge will identify mechanisms that can be targeted for development of novel and innovative bacterial control strategies including new antibacterial therapeutics.

Intrauterine and early postnatal  exposure to environmental toxicants may disrupt this delicate balance and result in respiratory morbidity  in children and adults. Inorganic arsenic is a ubiquitous environmental toxicant that targets the lung with  both neoplastic and non-neoplastic endpoints. Recent evidence in mice suggests that gestational  exposure to arsenic disrupts fetal lung development and results in an asthma-like phenotype in the  offspring. Studies in humans described increased incidence of bronchiectasis, dyspnea, chronic  obstructive and restrictive lung disease in children and young adults exposed to arsenic in utero. This  pilot project will develop and employ a human fetal lung xenograft model to determine the mechanisms  of arsenic-induced disruption of human fetal lung remodeling. Our central hypothesis is: Arsenic  exposure of human fetal lung xenotransplants results in disrupted postglandular lung remodeling,  mediated by molecular and epigenetic alterations. We will perform xenotransplants of 2nd trimester  human fetal lungs, allowing study of human lung maturation and cytodifferentiation from pseudoglandular  and canalicular stages of development. In Specific Aim 1. we will develop a human fetal lung xenograft  model of in utero arsenic exposure. We will assess the best graft conditions, including size, site and  initial stage to ensure optimal graft survival and maturation.

5R01AI085263-03,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Toxoplasma gondii is an intracellular protozoan parasite that has a worldwide distribution. Depending on the geographic area, 30-70% of the human population is infected with this parasite, and essentially the entire human population is at risk of infection. This obligate parasite is usually responsible for multi-organ failure only in immunocompromised individuals, especially those afflicted with AIDS, but if infection with T. gondii occurs during pregnancy, abortion or fetal abnormalities often occur. The combined efforts of IL-12 and IFN- are central to resistance to T. gondii. We have recently established that TLR11 plays a dominant role in sensing T. gondii, regulating IL-12 production, and activating T cell-mediated responses to the parasite. Concomitantly, TLR11 is represented in humans only by a non-functional pseudogene, and the major question of how human innate and adaptive immune responses occur in the absence of TLR11 remains unanswered. The overall goals of this project are 1) to determine the roles of neutrophils, macrophages, and DCs in the regulation of TLR11-independent induction of IL-12; 2) to determine the roles of NK, CD4, and CD8 T cells in IFN--dependent host resistance to T. gondii in the absence of TLR11; and 3) to identify similarities and differences during systemic and mucosal TLR11-independent immune responses to T. gondii. These studies are expected to identify mechanisms of TLR11-independent host resistance to T. gondii. In addition, these studies are essential for establishing animal models suitable for the design of protective vaccines against T. gondii, and possibly against other apicomplexan parasites.

5U54AI057168-09,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Shiga toxin (Stx) of Shigella dysenteriae type 1, Stx1 and Stx2 of Escherichia coli O157:H7, and  other Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC), and ricin from the castor bean plant cause depurination of a  critical residue in the 28S rRNA of 60S ribosomes and, hence, inhibition of protein synthesis, apoptosis, and  cell death. Humans are usually at risk of intoxication by Stx or ricin through ingestion of Stx-expressing  organisms or accidental intake of castor beans, respectively. Yet, these toxins are categorized as CDC  Select Agents because of their potency and potential use as bioterrorist weapons. Deliberate delivery of the  toxins may occur through intentional infection with STEC, or by ingestion, inhalation, or injection of ricin.  When the toxins are introduced orally, they must first interact with enterocytes of the gastrointestinal tract by  steps not yet defined, and, in some instances, breach the mucosa. Exactly how the association between  Stxs and colonic epithelial cells occurs for the non-invasive E .coli O157:H7 and other STEC is unclear  because these cells in humans do not express the Stx receptor globotriaosylceramide (Gb3). Nevertheless,  we demonstrated dose-dependent binding of Stx1 and Stx2 to human colonic epithelial HCT-8 cells despite  our inability to detect Gb3 on the surface of the cells. Moreover, Thorpe et al. reported that Stx1 is cytotoxic  for HCT-8 cells at high doses (a finding that we confirmed but could not show for Stx2) and that Stxl, Stx2,  and ricin cause varying degrees of inhibition of protein synthesis in HCT-8 cells. Thus, these ribotoxins  appear to gain entry into and at some level intoxicate human intestinal cells in culture, and one long range  goal of this project is to define the mechanisms by which Stxs and ricin cross the mucosal barrier. A second  ultimate objective is to design therapeutic compounds that inactivate the toxins in intoxicated cells. The  specific aims are to: 1. exploit non-Gb3-surface-expressing HCT-8 cells as a surrogate for normal human  colonic cells to evaluate the nature of Stx binding and the basis for the finding that Stx1 but not Stx2 can, at  high doses, kill HCT-8 cells; 2. monitor, by immunochemistry and biological activity, the translocation of Stxs  produced by E. coli O157:H7 during infection of a 3-dimensional (3-D) organoid model of HCT-8 cells, and  evaluate whether Stxs or ricin added to the surface of such multi-layered organoid tissue can transit from the  apical surface to underlying cell layers and/or elicit tissue damage; and, 3.develop recombinant Stx or ricin  cell-binding domains as platforms for conjugated therapeutics that selectively deliver into toxin-sensitive cells  either toxin-neutralizing antibodies or toxin inhibitors and then test these chimeric molecules on cell lines and  in mice for the capacity to ablate the lethal effects of Stx or ricin.",Shiga Toxin And Ricin Interaction With Enterocytes And Rescue Of Target Cells,,,"O'Brien, Alison Davis",University of Maryland Baltimore,Baltimore,MD,25,1,-1,1280
5R01AI087830-03,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Typhoid fever is a persistent infection caused by host adapted Salmonella species. Paradoxically, allowing pathogen persistence may also be beneficial for the host when immune-mediated damage outweigh the immediate risk posed by the infection. Our long-term goals are to identify the immune cells and signals activated during Salmonella infection that controls this balance between immune activation required for pathogen eradication with the associated risk of immune-mediated host injury, and immune suppression at the expense of pathogen persistence. The mouse model of S. typhimurium infection reproduces important features of persistent infection characteristic of human typhoid. Together with the abundance of immunological tools and reagents available only in mice, infection in this species is currently the best-available model for identifying the molecular and cellular signals that control this delicate immunological balance. Using this model, our preliminary studies indicate regulatory T cells (Tregs) that comprise a distinct lineage of CD4+ T cells characterized by Foxp3-expression play critical roles in dictating the balance between immune activation and bacterial persistence. Early after infection, Foxp3+Treg-ablation accelerates the kinetics of bacterial eradication, while augmenting Foxp3+Tregs causes reciprocal increases in pathogen burden. Therefore the overall goals of this application are to define the relative importance and identify the suppressive mechanism utilized by Tregs throughout persistent Salmonella infection. Aim 1 will expand on our preliminary findings that demonstrate drastic changes in Treg suppressive potency for cells isolated at early (day 5) and late (day 37) time points, by defining a comprehensive kinetic analysis for changes in Treg suppressive potency during persistent infection. Our specific goals are to identify when Treg suppressive potency peaks, nadirs, and returns to baseline levels, and the absolute magnitude for these changes. These results will establish the frame-work for complementary experiments that verify the importance of Tregs at these critical time points by quantifying the relative impacts of Treg-ablation. Using recently developed techniques for reconstituting Treg- ablated mice with donor Tregs from mice with targeted defects in defined Treg-associated molecules, Aim 2 will further explore the mechanistic basis for these changes in Treg suppression potency. These include experiments that will identify and dissociate the specific Treg-associated molecules that control host defense from those required for sustaining peripheral immune tolerance, and define Salmonella ligands and the corresponding pattern recognition receptors that dictate these changes in Treg suppression potency through cell-intrinsic stimulation. Together these experiments that utilize cutting edge immunological tools will not only fill important gaps in our current knowledge on the importance and the mechanism whereby Foxp3+Tregs control host defense during Salmonella infection, but also establish important paradigms for how Tregs may regulate immunity during other persistent infections.

5R01AI080654-02,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Vibrio cholerae is the etiologic agent of cholera, a devastating dehydrating diarrhea disease endemic in many parts of the world, imposing a significant burden of morbidity and mortality, especially on developing countries. The field of V. cholerae pathogenesis research has recently identified many of the molecular pathways by which colonization and toxin production, the key mechanisms by which these bacteria cause cholera, are tightly regulated. Missing from this equation, however, has been the key element in the virulence regulatory pathway: the host signals that V. cholerae hijack to induce bacteria's transcriptional commitments to pathoge- nesis and survival in the host. Using a novel ex vivo anaerobic intestinal tissue model we recently developed, we have identified two host-derived small molecules conserved among many mammalian species that can activate V. cholerae virulence gene transcription. We have named these compounds the Virulence-inducing Factors (VIFs). We propose in three specific aims to characterize VIFs and how V. cholerae sense these factors and integrate them into their virulence regulation. First, we will determine the virulence-inducing factor-2 (VIF-2) structure and mechanisms of action. We have found that both VIF-1 and VIF-2 activate key virulence determinants and require major virulence regulators AphB, TcpP, and ToxT to function. The VIF-2 has been partially determined as C12H17O6 and is likely to a novel class of molecules. We will solve VIF-2's structure using a number of chemistry analyses and then perform de novo synthesis to confirm the activity of VIF-2. Preliminary results suggest that AphB, a LysR-family protein with a conserved structure comprised of an N-terminal DNA-binding and a C-terminal ligand-binding domain, binds to VIF-2 and enhances tcpP expression. We thus propose that VIF-2 serves as the ligand of AphB and we will further investigate how AphB senses and responds to VIF-2 to regulate tcpP expression using in vitro purified systems and genetic analyses. Next, we will investigate how VIF-1 regulates virulence gene expression. We have successfully purified and identified VIF-1 as taurocholic acid, a bile acid. Preliminary studies suggest that VIF-1 enhances the activity of TcpP. We will apply biochemical and genetic methods to test our hypotheses that VIF-1 may directly interact with TcpP proteins to affect protein conformation and function. Alternatively, VIF-1 may affect TcpP activity indirectly, by interacting with TcpH, a TcpP stabilizing protein, or other V. cholerae components to enhance TcpP activity. Finally, we will determine the spatiotemporal and dynamic virulence gene expression in response to two host virulence-inducing factors. Our preliminary studies indicate that VIF-1 and VIF-2 feed into the virulence regulatory cascades by modulating TcpP protein levels (transcriptional) and activity (post-translational). We hypothesize that the availability of VIF- 1 and VIF-2 may vary in intestines with redundant signaling ensuring the appropriate induction of virulence genes at different intestinal locations or a gradient of virulence regulator levels controlling different target genes with varying activation affinities. Alternatively, both VIF-1 and VIF-2 may work synergistically to jump-start induction of virulence genes upon entering the host. We will quantify VIF concentration in different intestinal locations using HPLC-MS analysis. We will take advantage of our simple, accessible ex vivo anaerobic tissue model to mimic the VIF levels seen in vivo to monitor and model virulence gene expression patterns using qRT-PCR and fluorescence microscopy. By understanding the properties and role of VIFs, we hope to overcome the greatest stumbling block in the full understanding of V. cholerae colonization and pathogenesis, the identification of the signals that induce bacteria to take up residence in the host and cause disease. Our studies will hopefully lead to novel therapies that can target these most basic of V. cholerae virulence regulatory steps and shed new light on the host- pathogen interactions that underpin infections by related enteric bacterial pathogens.",Vibrio Cholerae-Host Interaction At The Intestinal Interface,2011,2015,"Zhu, Jun ",University of Pennsylvania,Philadelphia,PA,45,1,210,3817

5U19AI095261-02,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"T cells mediate immune responses against self and non-self antigens (Ags), including innocuous environmental Ags, which are sometimes erroneously interpreted as 'dangerous'. Misguided responses by Th2 polarized effector T cells (Teff) against certain environmental Ags, called allergens, promote the formation of humoral and cellular inflammatory responses that precipitate clinical symptoms, which become  manifest as various forms of allergy or asthma. Current clinical practice employs therapeutic strategies to tolerize allergic patients against specific allergens, indicating that pre-existing pathological Th2 responses can be 're-educated' resulting, at least in some cases, in permanent cures. However, current immunotherapy schemes typically require many months of continuous treatment, are unsuccessful in a sizable fraction of patients and carry the risk of adverse events, particularly anaphylaxis. Project 3 proposes to explore the use of induced tolerogenic dendritic cells (itDC) as an alternative strategy to rapidly achieve allergen-specific immunological tolerance in individuals suffering from allergic asthma or food allergy.  The rationale for this project is based on the fact that T cell function is controlled by dendritic cells (DC), which acquire and process Ags and, depending upon their maturation and differentiation status, instruct Agspecific T cells either to mount an effector response or to develop tolerance. A body of preliminary data  indicates that short-term exposure of murine as well as human DC to rapamycin and transforming growth factor B (TGFB) coverts the cells into itDC. Preliminary in vitro and in vivo experiments suggest that Ag-pulsed itDC exert tolerogenic effects on Ag-specific conventional T cells a) by converting them into Foxp3+  regulatory T cells (Treg) and b) by deleting Teff at sites of Ag challenge. In light of these findings, the hypothesis will be tested that itDC may be useful to treat T cell-dependent allergic diseases. To achieve this goal, Aim 1 will establish whether and to what extent itDC exert therapeutic effects in mouse models of Agdriven  allergic asthma and food allergy. Aim 2 will generate critical clues regarding the clinical translatability of findings in murine models to human food allergy and allergic asthma by systematically exploring the capacity of patient-derived DC to induce tolerogenic responses in autologous T cell subsets. These experiments will be performed in close synergy with Projects 1 and 2 and rely on technology, materials and  support from each Core of this Program.

5R21AI094228-02,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Several intracellular bacterial pathogens, such as Listeria ssp, Rickettsia spp. and Shigella spp., rely on actin-based motility to spread from infected cells to neighboring cells and disseminate within their host. Genetic and biochemical studies have revealed that actin-based motility relies on the production of virulence factors at the bacterial surface that interact with host cell cytoskeleton factors, including the ARP2/3 complex. In spite of these seminal contributions, the host cell factors supporting actin-based motility are still poorly understood. To fill this gap in knowledge, we have developed innovative approaches combining automated fluorescence microscopy and computer-assisted image analysis in order to visualize and quantify bacterial pathogen spread. We have used this newly developed approach to screen the human kinome and identified CK1 and CK2 as host cell kinases required for Listeria spread. We recently demonstrated that, similar to WASP and WAVE2, the affinity of ActA for the ARP2/3 complex is modulated by CK2-mediated phosphorylation, a notion that we refer to as regulatory mimicry. In this proposal we propose genetic and biochemical approaches designed to explore the role(s) of CK1 in the regulation of Listeria actin-based motility (Aim1). In addition, we propose to extend the approach used for investigating Listeria spread to several bacterial pathogens displaying actin-based motility, including Shigella and Rickettsia (Aim2). These exploratory studies may provide important and novel insights both into the mechanisms supporting Listeria, Shigella and Rickettsia pathogenesis and into the fundamental processes involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Various intracellular pathogens have evolved the ability to manipulate host cell processes in order to spread from infected cells into the neighboring cells. Most of he host factors contributing to the cell-to-cell spread of pathogens are unknown. In this proposal, we present our plans to determine and investigate the host cell kinases involved in Listeria spp., Shigella spp. and Rickettia spp. actin-based motility. The proposed approach will contribute to our general understanding of the mechanisms underlying microbial pathogenesis and may therefore constitute the foundation for the rational design of preventive and therapeutic interventions.",Regulation Of Bacterial Pathogen Actin-Based Motility By Host Cell Kinases,2011,2013,"Agaisse, Herve F",Yale University,New Haven,CT,8,1,263,4820

We seek to understand how Toxoplasma prepares for and achieves cell invasion. Although it has been well recognized that many Toxoplasma invasion proteins undergo proteolytic maturation en route to apical secretory organelles, little is known about the proteases involved or where and why maturation occurs. We hypothesize that T. gondii uses a cathepsin proteases to proteolytically activate and stabilize invasion proteins within a novel multivesicular endosome (MVE), based on preliminary immunolocalization, gene knockout, and inhibitor studies, along with protease specificity analysis and in vitro processing of a putative substrate. To test this hypothesis we will: (1) Characterize defects and compensatory mechanisms in CPL knockout parasites; (2) Confirm the overlapping roles of cathepsins in proMIC maturation by genetic and inhibitor studies; and (3) Test the lock and load hypothesis that proteolytic maturation stabilizes proMIC protein complexes. This work will illuminate basic mechanisms of secretory protein trafficking and proteolytic modulation of protein function that may be shared with related apicomplexan parasites and other eukaryotic cells that utilize regulated secretion. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our goal is to find new ways of interfering with Toxoplasma invasion of human cells as a strategy of controlling infections caused by this parasite.

2R56AI064285-06,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Shigella, NIAID category B pathogens, cause ~550 million cases of diarrhea or dysentery and 1.1 million deaths each year. Shigella infections are characterized by the induction of acute inflammation associated with a massive recruitment of neutrophils to the colon resulting in subsequent massive tissue destruction. Despite this impressive host response, Shigella survive in this harsh environment, primarily by invading and spreading between colonic epithelial cells. Shigella survival is primarily due to the ability of ths pathogen to directly usurp and regulate host cell processes through the activity of ~30 type 3 effectors, proteins that the bacteria directly injects into the host cell cytosol through its highl conserved type 3 secretion system. The Shigella type 3 secretion system is essential for all steps in Shigella pathogenesis including their invasion of host cells, escape from the phagosome, intracellular and intercellular spread and inhibition of the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The overall goal of our research is to understand how Shigella effectors enable this pathogen to evade and suppress host innate immune responses. Specifically we propose to determine the host cell proteins and or processes targeted by type 3 effectors that we have established to be involved in Shigella phagosomal escape and cell-to-cell, two steps in Shigella pathogenesis that are relatively poorly understood. These studies should prove general insights regarding the spread of intracellular bacterial pathogens. We also propose to identify host cell proteins directed ubiquitinated and targeted for degradation by Shigella effectors as these proteins are likely key elements in signaling pathways involved in normally inducing host innate immune defenses that normally act to combat bacterial pathogens. By performing and completing the proposed aims, we expect to greatly expand our understanding of how Shigella and other intracellular pathogens manipulate host cell processes in order to evade host innate immune defenses. This information will have the potential to guide the development of novel therapeutics to prevent and treat infections caused by Shigella and other bacterial pathogens.",Manipulation Of Epithelial Cells By Shigella,2012,2013,"Lesser, Cammie ",Massachusetts General Hospital,Boston,MA,26,1,106,4020
5R01GM046502-15,National Institute of General Medical Sciences,93,"Mercury and lead are pervasive in the environment and pose a severe risk to human health worldwide. The purpose of the proposed research is to develop new and innovative detoxification strategies for these metals. Organomercury compounds, in particular, are highly toxic as illustrated by the death of almost two thousand people around Minamata Bay (Japan) in the late 1950s when the residents consumed fish that were contaminated with methyl mercury compounds. Furthermore, the use of organomercurials as pesticides resulted in the death of ca 500 people in Iraq in the early 1970s when wheat seeds treated with these pesticides were used for making bread rather than for growing wheat. While the outbreak of methyl mercury poisoning in Japan was a result of toxic release from a nearby chemical plant, methyl mercury compounds are also introduced into the environment by biomethylation of naturally occurring Hg(II) in an aquatic environment and accumulate in predatory fish. Likewise, the occurrence of lead in the environment is a consequence of its current and previous widespread use in, for example, batteries, gasoline, plumbing and paints, such that lead poisoning is the most common environmentally induced disease among children in the United Stated today. It is, therefore, evident that the discovery of improved detoxification strategies for metals such as mercury and lead would be of considerable benefit for human health. A central component of the proposed research will be to elucidate the biological chemistry of these metals that will facilitate detoxification. This objective will be achieved by using a synthetic analogue approach in which small molecules are used to mimic the biological system. Since the toxic effects of mercury and lead are largely a consequence of the ability of these metals to bind effectively to the cysteine residues of proteins, specific emphasis will be given to the application of ligands that feature sulfur donors. The protolytic cleavage of the Hg-C bond is an important component of mercury detoxification in bacteria and so considerable effort will be directed towards understanding the factors that influence this process, so that improved detoxification strategies can be developed for human applications. In this regard, the primary treatment of heavy metal poisoning is chelation therapy, but the effectiveness of this technique is far from ideal. Therefore, new strategies for chelation therapy will be developed by directing effort towards discovering molecules that chelate toxic metals more effectively. For example, multidentate ligands that feature arenethiol groups will be investigated since these groups may serve the dual purpose of both cleaving a Hg-C bond and coordinating the mercury. Furthermore, effort will be directed towards discovering compounds that promote Hg-C bond cleavage in vivo, and which may be used in conjunction with traditional chelating agents. Both of these approaches are important because they represent significant advances over the methods currently employed.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mercury and lead are the two most toxic metals that are commonly encountered in the environment and are a severe risk to human health worldwide; as such, the discovery of improved detoxification strategies for these metals is of considerable importance to public health issues. A specific objective of the proposed research is to elucidate the chemistry of toxic metals in biological systems in order to enable the discovery of desperately needed new detoxification strategies.

2R01AI065638-06A1,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Intracellular pathogens cause a staggering number of human infections and deaths. The ability to subvert host innate immune responses is a key factor in the establishment of infections by these pathogens. Listeria monocytogenes is a facultative intracellular bacterial pathogen of humans and animals and is frequently used as a model to dissect mechanisms of immunity and pathogenesis. Our prior studies with L. monocytogenes identified a bacterial protein, p60, whose expression and secretion from the bacterium is required for pathogenicity in the mouse model of systemic infection. p60 is not required for Lm infection in cultured cells. We found that p60 stimulates the activation of host natural killer (NK) cells, an immune cell population associated with increased host susceptibility to L. monocytogenes and several other pathogenic bacteria. We have shown that p60 stimulates NK cells by binding to dendritic cells, and eliciting the production of IL-1&#191; and IL-18.  The ability of p60 to activate DCs and NK cells maps to a region of the protein containing a LysM domain. Purified p60 protein, or just the region of p60 containing the LysM domain is sufficient to stimulate NK cell activation. The host factor NLRP3 is also required for IL-18 production and NK cell activation in cultures with DCs, NK cells, and p60. In our first Aim, we will further define the mechanisms by which the LysM domain containing peptide uniquely binds and stimulates DCs for IL-18 production and NK cell activation. Molecular, imaging, immunological, and cell biological approaches will be used. In our second Aim, we will investigate how NLRP3 impacts host resistance during systemic bacterial infections. In our third Aim, we will characterize NK cells producing IL-10 in response to L. monocytogenes infection and p60. We also test how IL-10 production by NK cells impacts host immune responses and susceptibility to bacterial infection. Together, our work will reveal how LysM-containing bacterial  virulence factors subversively activate specific aspects of innate immunity in order to promote the establishment of systemic infections.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our studies will investigate the mechanisms by which a secreted bacterial protein activates host innate immune responses, and the basis by which such activation exacerbates infection by the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes.

5U19AI082655-04,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"The intestinal epithelium presents the largest mucosal barrier between the internal host milieu and the  external environment. Under physiological circumstances antigen trafficking occurs through three nonmutually  exclusive pathways: transcellular, paracellular, and dendritic cell sampling within the intestinal  lumen. When the delicate balance between controlled antigen trafficking and host immune response is lost,  severe inflammation and overt clinical symptoms may develop. This negative outcome may be influenced by  host genetic makeup, virulence traits of the intestinal pathogens, or the combination of both. The outcome of  the interplay between host and intestinal microorganisms is influenced by the fact that the intestinal  epithelium is extremely dynamic and exquisitely responsive to stimuli of innumerable variety and it is  populated by a complex climax community of microbial partners, far more numerous than the cells of the  intestine itself. In normal homeostasis, the gastrointestinal epithelial layer forms a tight, but selective barrier:  microbes and most antigens are held at bay, but nutrients from the essential to the trivial are absorbed  efficiently. Moreover, the tightness of the epithelial barrier is itself dynamic and depends on tight junctions  (TJ) competency, though the mechanisms governing and affecting their permeability are poorly understood.  What is becoming increasingly clear is that defects in epithelial permeability are associated with a large  number of local and even systemic disorders. A common feature of enteric infections is their ability to  increase epithelial permeability, an effect that initiates and promotes the host immune response. Mucosal  permeability is also a factor in the delivery of mucosally introduced vaccines. With this project, we intend to  capitalize on our combined expertise in mucosal biology, proteomics, genomics, microbiomics, biochemistry,  and molecular biology to determine the role of alterations in mucosal barrier function in host-microbial  interactions affecting antigen trafficking that lead to local and systemic immune responses to gastric  and enteric pathogens.

5U19AI082655-04,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Vaccination is one of the most successful and cost-effective ways of preventing infectious disease. The  development of effective vaccines for infections of the gastrointestinal tract however has been disappointing.  The need for these vaccines is crucial since diarrheal diseases due to infectious agents of the gut are the  second leading infectious cause of death in infants and young children world wide. Some of the Infectious  agents that cause diarrheal diseases include rotavirus, pathogenic Escherichia coli, Shigella spp.,  Salmonella spp., Cryptosporidium pan/urn, Entamoeba histolytica, and Vibrio cholera. The reason for the  lack of suitable vaccines for enteric pathogens is the lack of an effective adjuvant that can be delivered orally  with the vaccine to increase its potency at stimulating an immune response. Most experimental oral  adjuvants are ineffective or maintain some degree of toxicity. To address this problem, we propose to  couple synthetic peptides from enteric pathogens to a safe and stable adjuvant, aluminum oxide  nanoparticles for oral immunization. The peptides will be coupled to the nanoparticles in a way that  preserves their native conformation in order to optimize the immune response to recognize the native  pathogen. Since very few small animal models of enteric disease and immunity exist, we will use the human  pathogen Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) to infect the mouse gastric mucosa and we will test this technology  by 1) Identifying epitopes on H. pylori CagL that are crucial for binding of the bacteria to host cells using an  antibody blocking assay with human cell lines, 2) Testing the ability of those CagL epitopes, coupled to  aluminum oxide nanoparticles, to induce protective immunity when delivered to mice prior to challenge, 3)  Testing the ability of those CagL epitopes, coupled to aluminum oxide nanoparticles, to induce antibodies  that block pathogenic and carcinogenic events due to H. pylori infection, and 4) Evaluating the antibody  response of infected human subjects to determine if these blocking antibodies are induced by natural  infection in order to determine if the induction of these antibodies by vaccination would be beneficial to  human patients. A reduction of infection, inflammation, or carcinogenesis in the H. pylori model by  immunization with stable, targeted peptide epitopes coupled to nanoparticles would provide compelling  evidence for subsequent applications against other enteric bacterial infections in humans that induce  significant world wide morbidity and mortality.",Peptide Conformation Constrainment Technology And Novel Mucosal Adjuvants To,,,"Blanchard, Thomas G",University of Maryland Baltimore,Baltimore,MD,25,1,-1,-1
5R01AI080611-04,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Enteric virus infections cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Of these, human noroviruses (HuNoV) are severely understudied as they do not grow in small animals or readily available cell culture models and no directed disease prevention and control strategies exist. Answers to fundamental questions as to how these viruses enter cells remain unknown. For noroviruses, the initial events in the viral life cycle of receptor binding and entry are key in determining which cell types and tissues can be infected and ultimately the outcome of an infection. However, the knowledge of norovirus entry mechanisms is pivotal in designing therapies or strategies to combat disease or spread. Murine norovirus (MNV) is closely related to HuNoV and shares many biological and molecular characteristics. In contrast to HuNoV, MNV can be reverse engineered, replicates in tissue culture and provides a small animal model system. Therefore, the MNV model provides a tractable system to elucidate the viral and cellular determinants of norovirus entry for the first time. The current proposal will test the central hypothesis that specific residues in the P domain of the MNV-1 capsid interact with moieties on the host cell surface and this interaction leads to virus infection of cells. The following specific aims are designed to test this hypothesis: 1) Define the role of sialic acid during MNV-1 attachment; 2) Identify viral determinants of MNV-1 entry; 3) Define cellular mechanisms of MNV-1 entry into murine macrophages and dendritic cells. The methods used to address these aims include targeted mutagenesis of the viral capsid protein followed by infection studies in vitro and in vivo, fluorescence microscopy as well as molecular and cell biological approaches. Successful completion of these aims may reveal novel targets for antiviral drug design. It will advance our understanding of the norovirus life cycle and how viruses hijack the cellular machinery to infect macrophages and dendritic cells, particularly those of the GI tract. As such these studies will advance the fields of virology, cell biology and immunology.

This NV P particle is formed by 24 copies of the protruding (P) domain of NV capsid which has an ideal size for a subunit vaccine. The P particles can be readily produced in E. coli with simple purification procedures and low cost. The P particles are highly stable and immunogenic. In this study we will take advantage of the 3 surface loops of each P domain for foreign antigens presentation by insertion of the antigens into the surface loops. We have proven this concept by insertion of various small epitopes and large antigens on one of these loops, including the M2e epitope of influenza virus and rotavirus (RV) surface antigen VP8s. The P particle-M2e and -VP8 chimeras induced high titers of neutralizing antibodies against replication of influenza virus and RV and protected vaccinated mice from infection of the two viruses, respectively, in mouse challenge models. In addition, the resulting antibodies blocked NV-receptor attachment. In this study we will improve the P particle vaccine platform for broader applications by systematically assessing the capability and capacity of the other surface loops of the P particle to present foreign antigens and by construction of new user-friendly P particle vectors. In addition, we will perform challenge study using mouse model to improve the immune enhancement and production efficiency of the P particle platform through 1) increase of copy number of an inserted antigen, 2) addition of immunogenic stimulus molecules to the antigens, and 3) addition of a purification tag to the chimera.

PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this application we proposed to develop our recently discovered subviral particle, the norovirus (NV) P particle, into a vaccine platform for antigen presentation and thus for novel vaccine development. The P particle is composed of 24 copies of NV protruding (P) domains. Each P domain in the P particle has three exposed loops on its distal surface and these loop have been shown to be excellent sites for foreign antigen presentation. Antigens can be inserted onto one to three surface loops of the P domain by molecular cloning. The resulting recombinant protein will spontaneously form chimeric P particle that contain at least 24 copies of the inserted antigen on the surface of the P particle. The P particles can be easily produced in E. coli, are highly stable and highly immunogenic and, therefore, are an ideal vaccine platform. We have accumulated a large amount of data in insertion and presentation of several protein and peptide antigens on the P particle, including the M2e epitope of influenza virus and the surface antigen VP8 of rotavirus (RV). In this application we will gather further evidence on usefulness of P particle as a platform for vaccine development against various infectious diseases. Two lines of experiments will be performed to fulfill our goals. In Aim 1 the capability and capacity of individual surface loops for small-to-large antigen insertions will be systematically assessed for a maximal application of the P particle platform. To facilitate these experiments, user-friendly P particle vectors with a convenient cloning cassette in each loop will be generated. Our goal is to maximize the usefulness of the P particle vaccine platform.

Particular attention will be paid to the improvement of immune enhancement by increasing the copy number of an antigen per P particle. This will be achieved through an insertion of a repeated M2e epitopes in individual loops of the P particle. We also will examine whether further immune enhancement can be reached by an extra antigenic stimulus molecule to be inserted to the P particles-M2e and -VP8 chimeras.

5R01DK056754-13,National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,24,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are chronic diseases characterized by a pronounced infiltration of neutrophils (PMNs) into colonic mucosal lesions, accompanied by epithelial cell necrosis and ulceration. Disease activity and patient symptoms also correlate with the histologic finding of PMN infiltrates within the mucosa and surface epithelium. This same histological event of massive transepithelial migration of PMNs occurs in the acute phase of gastroenteritis induced by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (salmonellosis). Thus, insight into pathogen elicited active inflammation of the intestine will serve as an important model to provide valuable information relating to active inflammation in IBD. Using the enteric pathogen S. typhimurium as a tool to investigate mechanisms underlying PMN recruitment across the intestinal epithelia, we have demonstrated a novel and central role for the eicosanoid hepoxilin A3 (HXA3). HXA3 is a derivative of arachidonic acid formed from the enzymatic action of the 12-lipoxygenase (12-LO) pathway. This observation has unlocked a previous unexplored phenomenon that mechanistically explains a primary histopathologic feature of active states of intestinal inflammation. Moreover, we have recently shown that HXA3 is secreted through an efflux transport system located at the apical surface of the intestinal epithelia that involves the ABC transporter MRP2. We also revealed that induction of intestinal inflammation corresponds to a profound up-regulation of the apical expression of MRP2. Such up-regulation of MRP2 was further demonstrated in vivo in chronic murine models of IBD and human intestinal biopsy tissues from patients with active CD or UC. Thus, the primary objectives of this project are to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying HXA3 synthesis (Specific Aim 1), as well as to determine how HXA3 production is regulated (Specific Aim 2). To accomplish these aims we plan to use a combination of complementary in vitro and in vivo models coupled with state of the art cellular, molecular, and biochemical techniques. We hypothesize that understanding HXA3/MRP2 based signaling, which directs the movement of PMNs across the intestinal epithelium, will lead to the development of important therapeutics designed to help control this inflammatory event in patients with infectious, allergic, and idiopathic (IBD) colitis.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is estimated that as many as one million Americans have inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with that number evenly split between Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Males and females appear to be affected equally. IBDs including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are chronic recurrent inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract that are of unkown etiology. Although the exact pathogenesis of IBDs is poorly understood, evidence indicates that it involves interaction between the immune system, genetic susceptibility, and the environment. These diseases are characterized by a pronounced infiltration of neutrophils (PMNs) into colon mucosal lesions, accompanied by epithelial cell necrosis and ulceration. Moreover, disease activity and patient symptoms correlate with the histologic finding of PMN infiltrates within the mucosa and surface epithelium. Curiously, this same histological event of massive transepithelial migration of PMNs occurs in the acute phase of gastroenteritis induced by Salmonella enteritis serovar Typhimurium (salmonellosis). Thus, while the evolution of these responses most likely initially targeted pathogens such as S. typhimurium, perhaps aberrant activation of such pathways also occurs, leading to inappropriate states of active intestinal inflammation. The goal of this proposal is to understand the molecular mechanisms by which S. typhimurium triggers and controls the directed movement of PMN across the epithelial surface so that novel targets for therapeutic intervention in such inflammatory bowel diseases can be identified.",Intestinal Inflammation Induced By Pathogens,1999,2015,"Mccormick, Beth A",Univ of Massachusetts Med Sch Worcester,Worcester,MA,26,1,-1,4851

We propose to develop  Tg mice even more sensitive human prions and use these as well as existing Tg mice for the detection of  human prions. The bioassay data will be compared to measurements of both the protease-sensitive (s) PrPSc  as well as protease-resistant (r) PrPSc. We shall also study the tissue distribution of prion infectivity as well as  sPrPSc and rPrPSc in both people and animal models. Our studies may elucidate some of the factors that  feature in the transmission of prions between humans and animals. Currently, the Tg mice that are most  susceptible to human prions are those expressing a chimeric Mo/Hu PrP, which differs from MoPrP at just  six residues. These Tg mice are susceptible to prions from patients who died of sporadic (s) Creutzfeldt-  Jakob disease (CJD), in just 80 days. We plan to study systematically the effect of each of these six  residues on susceptibility to prion infection, and determine how the expression level of the transgene impacts  the incubation time to disease onset after inoculation. We shall also use guinea pigs as models for human  prion diseases, having recently demonstrated that they uniquely reproduce the pathological features of  variant (v) CJD. The large brain and blood volumes of the guinea pig makes them useful for CNS imaging  studies as well as investigations of prions in blood and lymphoid tissues.

Whether guinea pigs will reproduce these differences in prion distribution remains to be established. While  only four cases of vCJD occurred in the UK last year, the possibility that vCJD prions have contaminated the  human blood supply cannot be ignored.

5R01AI033096-22,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) is an important diarrheal pathogen worldwide, and is the most common cause of bacterial gastroenteritis in the U.S. For 18 years we have explored the pathogenesis of this organism, including the description of a global activator of virulence genes, AggR, a multifunctional intestinal colonization factor, Aggregative Adherence Fimbriae (AAF), and a secreted protease called Pic, which cleaves mucin to provide supplemental growth substrates. In this request for continued funding, we will explore these and other aspects of EAEC pathogenesis. This application comprises four Aims. Aim 1. EAEC pathogenesis in the mouse. The IL10-/- mouse represents the first small whole animal model for EAEC. In this model, EAEC strain 042 elicits pan-colitis, which is not seen with other wild type E. coli strains tested. The streptomycin- treated conventional mouse, in contrast, serves as a colonization, but not disease, model, which we have used to characterize in vivo gene expression. In this aim we will use conventional mice and in vivo gene expression analyses to characterize the signals which control aggR expression in vivo, focusing specifically on biliary and pancreatic signals. We will also characterize the EAEC genes that contribute to colitis in the IL10-/- mouse, focusing on fliC, aafA and aafB mutants. Aim 2. Structure-function studies of the AAF adhesin. AAF are required for 1) binding of EAEC to the human intestine, 2) biofilm formation on abiotic surfaces, 3) adherence to T84 monolayers, 4) induction of IL-8 from polarized T84 monolayers, 5) disruption of tight junctions and barrier perturbation, and 6) adherence to and secretion of fibronectin. In this aim, we will leverage our recently completed solution structure of the AAF/II major pilin subunit to address the structure-function relationships underlying of these effects. Aim 3. Role of fibronectin binding and secretion in EAEC pathogenesis. We have shown that EAEC strains perturb the tight junctions of infected T84 monolayers, and also that EAEC induces the release of IL-8 from these epithelial cells. We have also found that EAEC binds to fibronectin, and that addition of Fn to T84 monolayers enhances adherence of 042 to the monolayer. Moreover, we have shown that infection of polarized T84 monolayers results in an increase in Fn release into the apical compartment. We will characterize the mechanisms of Fn release and the effects of Fn binding by EAEC. Aim 4. Role of the Pic protease in EAEC metabolism. Most EAEC strains and nearly all Shigella flexneri 2a strains secrete the Pic protease into the extracellular compartment. The presence of Pic enhances colonic colonization, and the mechanism of this effect in vitro appears to be via the release of growth substrates from mucin. In this aim we will characterize further this effect. Results of these studies will guide future interventions against this emerging pathogen.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) is the most common bacterial cause of diarrhea in the U.S.. The organism causes diarrhea by adhering to the lining of the intestine and eliciting fluid secretion and inflammation.

5F30DK091151-02,National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,24,"Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) infection is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality from diarrhea in developing countries. The mechanisms underlying its pathogenesis are not completely understood. Epithelial tight junctions (TJs) restrict the passage of water and ions across the epithelium. TJs are not static; proteins constantly recycle between the plasma membrane and the cytoplasm with contributions of newly synthesized TJ proteins. EPEC induce TJ disruption in a type III secretion system dependent manner. The hypothesis of this proposal is that specific EPEC effector molecules block homeostatic movement of TJ proteins that maintain and restore TJ structure and barrier function. EPEC effectors EspG1/2 destroy microtubule (MT) networks. We hypothesize that these networks are essential for recycling TJ proteins back to the membrane. NleA interferes with anterograde transport through the ER and Golgi, potentially preventing newly synthesized TJ proteins from reaching the TJ. Together, these effectors likely contribute to disruption of TJ structure and function by impeding repair mechanisms. The following specific aims will address this hypothesis. 1: To determine if EPEC infection delays recovery of TJ structure and barrier function following disruption. The impact of EPEC effectors on TJ recovery after calcium chelation will be determined. The duration of effector expression in infected intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) will be defined using myc-tagged effectors. It is anticipated that effector proteins will persist during TJ recovery and that recovery will be significantly delayed. 2: To investigate the effect of EPEC- induced microtubule disruption on the homeostatic maintenance and recovery of TJs. Biotinylation assays will be used to determine the rate of TJ protein recycling after infection with EPEC WT or DespG1/2. IEC will be transfected to express EspG1, or treated with nocodazole to disrupt MTs. Effects on TJ recovery will be determined. In vivo studies will be performed using a transgenic EGFP-occludin mouse. The rates of intestinal epithelial TJ recovery following infection with wild-type (WT) EPEC versus DespG1/2 will be compared. It is anticipated that more TJ proteins will recycle and TJ recovery will be more rapid in the absence of EspG1/2. 3: To investigate the contribution of EPEC-induced interference of ER-Golgi trafficking of newly synthesized proteins on TJ maintenance and reconstruction and to determine the combined effect of EPEC effectors on TJ recovery. IEC will be transfected to express NleA, or treated with brefeldin A, and the effects on TJ recovery following calcium chelation will be measured. In vivo studies using EGFP-occludin transgenic mice will be performed to compare the rate of TJ recovery after infection with WT EPEC and DnleA. A triple DespG1/2/nleA mutant will be created and its effects on recovery of TJ structure and function will be determined. We hypothesize that NleA will significantly impact TJ recovery structurally and functionally, but that the triple mutant will recover the most rapidly. This proposal is the first to investigate TJ recovery as a pathogenic target. It directly addresses a need for greater understanding of how EPEC affects the intestinal epithelial barrier.",Enteropathogenic E.

1R01AI096836-01A1,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Toxoplasma gondii belongs to the phylum Apicomplexa and is an important cause of congenital disease and infection in immunocompromised patients. The parasite has a complex secretory system essential for host cell invasion and establishment of the parasitophorous vacuole. Biogenesis of these secretory organeles remains poorly understood but several groups have postulated a compartment situated between Golgi and mature micronemes and rhoptries in which sorting and processing occurs.  We have recently discovered a novel post-Golgi compartment of T. gondii that we named the plant-like vacuole (PLV) and the goal of this project is to investigate its function in the biology of the parasite. This organelle is a large multi-vesicular structure that possesses similarities to the central vacuole found in plant cells. This organelle can be labeled with antibodies against proteins with great similarity to vacuolar plant pumps and channels, such as a K+sensitive V-H+PPase (TgVP1), and a tonoplast-like aquaporin (TgAQP1). Physiological studies further revealed similarities to plant vacuoles such as the presence of a V-H+ATPase, Na? and Ca2? antiporters, and calcium storage. Furthermore, as plant vacuoles, the PLV also contains proteases such as cathepsin L (TgCPL) and others. Our results and those of our collaborators showed that the PLV is a prominent feature of extracellular tachyzoites and, as the plant vacuole, has multiple potential functions including roles in protein sorting and resistance to environmental stresses. For example, the role of this vacuole in the proteolytic maturation of at least two microneme precursor proteins, proTgM2AP and proTgMIC3, suggests that this organelle could represent an endocytic/exocytic hub where sorting of proteins targeted to various organelles occurs. T. gondii tachyzoites that overexpress VP1 in the PLV, become more resistant to sodium stress pointing to an important role of the PLV in resistance to environmental ionic stress. Ionic stress is a major challenge that T. gondii confronts when exiting the host cell into the extracellular media. There is a dramatic change in the concentration of sodium, potassium, calcium and other ions between the intracellular and the extracellular environment. Dealing with these stressful changes is important for the survival of the parasite, which needs to actively invade other host cells to continue with its lytic cycle.  We will test two hypotheses, which have been developed based on the functions of the plant vacuole and preliminary observations in the parasite, using a combination of genetic and cell biological experiments. This novel organelle acts to regulate ions and/or as a post Golgi sorting compartment for secretory proteins destined to the micronemes, rhoptries, and acidocalcisomes. These models are not mutually exclusive if we take into account the fact that the plant vacuole is home to a complex set of functions (storage, sorting, stress, plant growth, etc.). We think that the PLV plays a central role during the extracellular phase of the parasite not only in resisting environmental stress but also as it prepares itself for invading the next host cell.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This work is designed to test the hypotheses that the plant-like vacuole (PLV) of T. gondii is involved in the regulation of calcium and pH homeostasis and response to salt stress, as well as in sorting and processing of proteins to organelles such as the rhoptries and acidocalcisomes.

5R01AI077571-04,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Giardiasis is the most common cause of acute protozoan intestinal infection worldwide, and chronic giardiasis is a major contributor to high morbidity in developing countries. Due to the lack of concerted research efforts, giardiasis has been designated a World Health Organization (WHO) neglected disease. Giardia intestinalis is a parasitic protist, and its pathogenicity is dependent upon attachment to the intestinal microvilli via the ventral disc, a novel cytoskeletal structure. Conflicting biophysical support and a conspicuous lack of molecular evidence have hampered the investigation of proposed giardial attachment mechanisms. The primary focus here is to evaluate support for two classic hypotheses that explain giardial attachment: the Conformational Change model and the Hydrodynamic model. The Conformational Change model proposes that conformational changes of the ventral disc cause suction-based attachment. We will investigate putative disc conformational dynamics using high resolution cryoelectron tomography of the ventral disc, live cell imaging, and novel attachment assays (Aim 1). We will also examine the role of disc-associated annexins (1-giardins) in disc conformational dynamics (Aim 2), and identify and characterize novel disc-associated components using a genome-wide, high-throughput random GFP visual screen (Aim 3). The Hydrodynamic Model of giardial attachment posits that the ventral flagella produce a hydrodynamic current enabling suction-based attachment. To test this alternative, we will assay attachment dynamics in various mutants with motility defects (Aim 2). Lastly, to inform our analyses of disc structure and function (Aims 1-3), we will characterize dorsal disc biogenesis and parental disc disassembly during cell division (Aim 4). After mitosis, two dorsal daughter discs are assembled and the parental ventral disc and median body are disassembled. Using live imaging of photoactivatable GFP- tagged strains and analyses of microtubule disassembly mutants, we will test the hypothesis that the median body acts as a reservoir of disc components for dorsal daughter discs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Giardia intestinalis is one of the ten major parasites in humans, and the current lack of understanding about Giardia has resulted in it being designated a neglected disease. One sixth of the world's population is believed to suffer from giardiasis. Giardia attaches to the host small intestine via an undefined mechanism. The research proposed here directly investigates the attachment mechanism of Giardia, and will offer additional targets for drug discovery.

5R01CA118493-06,National Cancer Institute,99,"DESCRIPTION: The incidence of cutaneous melanoma (CM) is increasing faster than any other cancer in the United States. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is the major environmental etiologic risk factor implicated in the development of CM. However, other environmental agents may also be important. Prior studies have reported associations between arsenic and non-melanoma skin cancers. Our recent study of CM cases and arsenic found an adjusted odds ratio of 2.1 for the highest quartile of arsenic in toenail samples (trend p-value=0.001). We propose to verify these findings through a stronger study design. We will conduct a population-based case-control study of incident CM cases and arsenic content detected in toenail samples. To eliminate biases of our earlier study, we will a) use newly diagnosed cases rather than prevalent cases, b) use toenails collected within 1-9 months of diagnosis, c) use a non-cancer control group, and d) use neutron activation analysis (NAA), considered the  gold standard  in trace element analyses. CM cases in Iowa residents will be semi-rapid reported through the Iowa Cancer Registry. Population-based controls will be identified using the Iowa Voter Registration file, which is comparable to the Iowa Census data. We will mail subjects an introductory letter, instructions for the toenail sample collection and small baggie. We will then conduct the survey using computer assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) software in order to collect complex data related to residential histories (water source, sun exposure, and occupations). This format will allow interviewers to collect a residential history and probe for additional information about potential exposures at each residence. We will focus on arsenic detected by NAA in toenail samples from cases and controls. Additionally, we will assess known risk factors for CM in this population (including natural and artificial UV exposure, residential and occupational histories, sun sensitivity factors, family history of skin cancer, and sunscreen use). We will also correlate available data on arsenic levels in current drinking water to arsenic in subjects' toenails. Recording residential histories and relating them to current and historical water sources will allow us to examine the length of the potential arsenic exposure, since drinking water is believed to be the main source of arsenic exposure and may provide evidence of long term exposure. Collecting biomarkers of arsenic exposure along with surveying subjects about known UV factors and their sun sensitivity will allow for the examination of important interactions and potential confounding of the association between arsenic and CM.",Skin Cancer And Arsenic Exposure,2008,2014,"Dennis, Leslie K.",University of Arizona,Tucson,AZ,4,1,167,3826
5R01AI045125-13,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Gene regulation by ToxR, TcpP and ToxT in V. cholerae The major virulence factors of Vibrio cholerae, cholera toxin and toxin-coregulated pilus (CT and TCP, respectively) are controlled by a cascade of regulators that ultimately leads to activation of ToxT by two membrane-localized activators, ToxR and TcpP. ToxT is the direct activator of cholera toxin and toxin-coregulated pilus gene expression, as well as expression of other genes whose roles in the biology and pathogenicity of V. cholerae are less well defined. The membrane activators, ToxR and TcpP, each depend for their activity on a cognate effector protein, ToxS and TcpH, although the mechanism of this dependence may be different for each pair of proteins. A major discovery of the prior funding period is that TcpP is subjected to regulate intramembrane proteolysis that is antagonized by TcpH. This process requires the YaeL protease as the second of two proteases that eliminate TcpP from the cell. TcpP is necessary to activate the toxT gene, and another major discovery from the most recent period of NIH support for this work was identification of a small RNA molecule (tarA) under direct transcription control of ToxT. Based on significant preliminary data and published manuscripts, the current proposal has three aims: 1. Comprehensive analysis of TcpP and TcpH interaction and the regulated intramembrane proteolysis pathway that governs TcpP levels in the cell, including the identification of the still unknown site I protease; 2. Screens for small molecule inhibitors of the ToxR/TcpP arm of the regulatory pathway and characterization of the targets of those inhibitors as well as the mechanism of inhibitor; 3, the tarA mechanism of action.

7F32AI085706-03,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"The secreted virulence factors of pathogenic microorganisms and their role in manipulating host cells have been the subject of intense study. However, almost nothing is known regarding the manipulation of host protein localization by pathogens and how this alters innate immune function. The Isberg lab recently showed that YopT, a secreted Yersinia virulence factor that removes the prenylated tail of host Rho family GTPases, promotes relocalization of Raci from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Raci is associated with control of a number of immune signaling pathways, including direct binding to the transcription factor STAT3. In this application, I hypothesize that the YopT-induced Raci nuclear accumulation shifts immune cells to a state having a lowered inflammatory response, allowing pathogenic Yersinia to establish a persistent bacterial infection. To test this hypothesis I will first determine the consequences of YopT- induced Raci nuclear localization on STAT3 localization, nuclear export, and phosporylation. I will then determine the effect of Raci nuclear localization on host immune cell function, including the transmission of signals through the lL-10 and lL-6 receptors and the induction of inflammatory immune responses upon infection with Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. Finally, I will examine the role this manipulation of host protein localization plays in Yersinia pseudotuberculosis pathogenesis. These experiments will provide detailed information on how a pathogen controls the balance between states of lower and higher virulence by forcing altered compartmentalization of a host protein.       Relevance to public health: Bacterial infectious diseases continue to cause sickness and death around the world. The pathogenic Yersinia species, which include the species that caused the Black Plague and the gastro-intestinal pathogens Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and Yersinia enterocolitica, all share a common factor that they inject into their mammalian host.

1K22AI099087-01,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"The goal of this research is to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying quorum sensing, a cell-cell communication process that allows bacteria to coordinate population-wide gene expression and function as coordinated groups. Quorum sensing relies on the production, detection, and response to chemical signal molecules called autoinducers. Disruption of any one of these steps renders pathogenic bacteria avirulent. The research proposed here will provide an understanding of the molecular mechanisms underpinning signal production, detection and response in quorum-sensing which will enable the design of interference strategies that can be developed into new therapies to combat infectious diseases.  The human pathogen Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of the disease cholera, regulates virulence factor production and biofilm formation through quorum sensing via a new class of autoinducer, called CAI-1 ((S)-3-hydroxytridecan-4-one). CAI-1 is produced by the CqsA synthase and detected by the transmembrane histidine kinase receptor CqsS. Histidine kinase receptors are ubiquitous in bacteria and play important roles in bacterial pathogenesis, nonetheless, little is known about their molecular mechanism of signal transduction across the membrane. This is, in part, due to a profound lack of chemically defined ligands for histidine kinases. By determining the biosynthetic pathway for and structure of CAI-1, and examining the CAI-1-CqsS interaction as well interactions between CqsS and a series of related, synthetic molecules, my postdoctoral work demonstrated that the CqsA/CqsS/CAI-1 signaling pathway offers an unprecedented opportunity to study ligand-receptor interactions and transmembrane signaling by histidine kinase receptors. With this work as the foundation, going forward, my first aim is to use CAI-1/CqsS as a model system to define how this important class of receptors recognizes and propagates external signals internally into the cell. My second aim focuses on co-evolution of signal production by the CqsA synthases and signal recognition by the partner CqsS receptors. As a postdoc, I showed that signal production and signal recognition in each vibrio CqsA/CqsS pair are matched. That is, either a particular CqsA synthesizes multiple related molecules and the cognate CqsS receptor detects them all, or the CqsA enzyme produces one specific molecule and the cognate CqsS receptor is exquisitely selective for detection of that ligand. The biological significance of this co-evolution and the molecular mechanism that specifies stringency or lack thereof are unclear and I will study this phenomenon. Our understanding of the role quorum sensing plays in V. cholerae physiology is limited to virulence factor production and biofilm formation. However, the V. cholerae quorum-sensing regulon is composed of more than 100 genes in addition to those known to be involved in virulence and biofilm formation. My recent work showed that V. cholerae mutants unable to activate a quorum-sensing response are exquisitely sensitive to low pH. In my final aim, I will study the molecular mechanisms underpinning quorum-sensing dependent regulation of Acid Tolerance Response. The long term goal is to define the roles of V. cholerae quorum-sensing response in coping with the changes in the environment and in the host.  It is now well established that quorum sensing is employed by many bacterial species to regulate both harmful and beneficial traits. A long standing goal of the quorum-sensing field is to develop pro-quorum- sensing and/or anti-quorum-sensing small molecules to manipulate these behaviors. This study will make progress toward this important goal.           PUBLIC HELATH RELEVANCE: Vibrio cholerae is a globally important pathogen and the burden of cholera is estimated to reach several million cases annually. V. cholerae virulence depends on a cell-cell communication process called quorum sensing that controls the timing of production and release of virulence factors and the formation of biofilms.

In order to successfully induce immune response, DNA vaccine needs to enter target cell for transcription and subsequent protein production. An ideal delivery carrier needs to be safe and effective in targeting specific cell, provide sufficient protection of DNA plasmid during transportation, as wel as low- responses to any existing self-immunity. Deficient viral particles, such as adenoviruses or retroviruses, offer an attractive option with great benefits in targeting and protection but majr drawbacks on strong self-immunity as well as the complexity in producing recombinant viral particles. Non-replicating virus-like particle derived from human hepatitis E virus (HEV-VLP) is empty icosahedral cage composed of 60 copies of recombinant HEV capsid proteins. This VLP is capable of encapsulating DNA vaccine in vitro, delivering DNA vaccine to epithelium cell at gastrointestinal tract, and inducing antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses. The simple procedure in DNA encapsulation makes HEV-VLP of particular interest as gene carrier; however, induction of self-immunity is still the hurdle in using HEV-VLP for therapeutical vaccination. Our studies on HEV-VLP crystal structure and antigenic structure reveal a structural modularity, with which HEV recombinant capsid proteins interplay between VLP assembly and antigen presentation. By carrying insertion of 15 amino acids at an antibody-binding site, the chimeric VLP reduces the reactivity to anti-HEV antibodies meanwhile retains the icosahedral assembly. This data suggests us a strategy to lower the reactivity of VLP to antibody- induced neutralization by structural alteration at antibody-binding sites, a mechanism that viruses have evolved to mediate their escape from host immune surveillance.  The proposed experiments in this application include 1) using cryo-electron microscopy and image reconstruction to identify HEV-VLP surface flexible loops that critical to antibody interactions; 2 inserting short peptide into the identified surface loops to create chimeric VLP with attenuate reactivity to HEV-VLP; 3) both wild type and chimeric VLPs will be evaluated in delivery of DNA vaccine encoding the surface antigen of hepatitis B virus, as potential gene carrier for treatment of chronic progressive hepatitis B. Because HEV is an enteric transmitted virus, HEV-VLP is able to transcytose the mucosal barrier at gastrointestinal tract and target specific mucosal region for antigen production. When a short peptide bearing mucosal adhesion ligand is inserted into surface antigenic loops, the chimeric VLP is hypothesized to have strong specificity in targeting mucosal region, leading to potent induction of mucosal immunity. In collaboration with Dr Kit Lam and Dr Christopher Walker, two experts respectively in drug discovery and HBV vaccine development, we expect to obtain sufficient data leading us to repeated use of HEV-VLPs as carrier for clinical gene therapy.",Present Homologous And Heterologous Antigen With Hepatitis E Virus,2012,2014,"Cheng, R.holland ",University of California At Davis,Davis,CA,6,1,-1,5634

When these toxic species proliferate, they may cause massive kills of fish and shellfish, wildlife mortality, human illness and death. One of these marine organisms, pseudo-nitzchia produces a neurotoxin, Domoic Acid (DA). Most of what we know about the human health effects of Domoic Acid has been derived from a single documented outbreak in Montreal Canada in 1987. Persons who ate mussels with high levels of DA suffered serious medical illnesses, including seizures and coma, and 3 people died. Survivors were left with a profound memory disorder, Amnesic Shellfish poisoning (ASP). Based upon animal models, regulatory levels of DA in shellfish were established.

An alternative sigma factor called CE (SigmaE, RpoE) controls extracytoplasmic stress responses in Salmonella enterica sv. Typhimurium and other bacteria. We have demonstrated that CE is required for Salmonella virulence and resistance to killing by macrophages and antimicrobial peptides. During the last project period, we have discovered: (a) a novel mechanism of CE activation by acid pH important for survival in macrophages, (b) two new CE-regulated virulence genes encoding a peptidyl-prolyl isomerase and a periplasmic protein of unknown function, and (c) unanticipated interactions linking CE to other stress regulatory networks. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that CE acts in concert with the Rcs, Psp, Cpx and Bae systems to form an integrated regulatory network that defends bacteria from cell envelope damage and maintains pathways of energy generation essential for cellular homeostasis. The specific aims are to explore the mechanisms underlying our recent findings: 1. Analyze the mechanism by which CE is activated by acid pH.  Biochemical and genetic approaches will be used to examine the effects of pH on the conformation of the periplasmic RseA domain and its function in the CE regulatory cascade. 2. Determine the mechanism by which the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase SlpA and the periplasmic protein YggN promote bacterial virulence.  Proteomic and phenotypic assays will explore the contributions of SlpA and YggN to Salmonella pathogenesis. 3. Investigate the mechanisms by which the Psp and Rcs systems preserve cell survival under stress conditions. A range of functional and biochemical studies will assess the central role of proton motive force and its preservation by extracytoplasmic stress responses. These studies will provide important new insights into conserved mechanisms of bacterial pathogenesis that have broad biological implications.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Salmonella is an important cause of gastrointestinal and systemic infections in both industrialized and developing countries.

1R21AI098742-01,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Campylobacter jejuni is a major enteric pathogen and is responsible for a large number of gastroenteritis worldwide. Clinical treatment of campylobacteriosis requires the use of fluoroquinolone or macrolide antibiotics, but antibiotic-resistant Campylobacter is increasingly prevalent, compromising the effectiveness of antibiotic therapy. Novel strategies are urgently needed to control infections caused by antibiotic-resistant Campylobacter. Among the various mechanisms utilized by Campylobacter for antibiotic resistance, the CmeABC multidrug efflux pump is a critical and predominant player in the resistance to a wide range of antimicrobials and toxic compounds. This efflux system also plays an important role in facilitating the emergence of fluoroquinolone-resistant mutants from susceptible Campylobacter under antibiotic selection. To develop novel measures to combat antibiotic-resistant Campylobacter, we have initiated studies to explore the feasibility of using antisense Peptide Nucleic Acid (PNA) to target CmeABC. Our preliminary result suggests that the antisense PNA approach has a strong potential to inhibit the expression of cmeABC and sensitize Campylobacter to antibiotics. In this application, we will further develop and evaluate the antisense PNA approach as an adjunctive therapy for antibiotic-resistant Campylobacter. The Specific aim for the R21 phase is to develop and evaluate anti-CmeABC PNAs that effectively potentiate antibiotics against antimicrobial-resistant Campylobacter and the specific aims for the R33 phase are to assess the feasibility of using anti-CmeABC PNAs as an adjunctive therapy to combat antibiotic-resistant Campylobacter in an animal model, determine the efficiency of PNAs in preventing the emergence of fluoroquinolone-resistant mutants from susceptible Campylobacter, and improve the permeability and stability of PNAs by modifying cell-penetrating peptides. The proposed work takes advantage of a novel target (CmeABC) and a novel technology (antisense PNA) and utilizes both in vitro and in vivo methodologies. Once completed, the project will have developed an effective mean to extend the utility of existing antibiotics against drug-resistant Campylobacter. Furthermore, the technical platform established in this project can be potentially adapted for other antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Thus the work will not only significantly advance the discovery of novel adjunctive therapies for antibiotic-resistant Campylobacter, but also potentially benefit the development of therapy for other pathogens.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Campylobacter jejuni is a major enteric pathogen causing gastroenteritis in humans. Prevalence of antibiotic resistance in Campylobacter has become a major concern for public health.

5R03AI096265-02,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"RNA viruses mutate and evolve more quickly than all other human pathogens. However, RNA viruses do not all evolve at the same fast rate. It is important to distinguish the faster evolving RNA viruses because they are more likely to create drug-resistant variants or evade vaccine-induced immune responses. Whole families of RNA viruses are known to be more evolvable than others, but we know very little about what causes individual viruses to evolve more rapidly than closely related viruses in the same family. We will test whether tissue tropism could be one of the factors affecting evolutionary rates. Specifically, we are testing if genes within enteric viruses, those that infect the gastro-intestinal tract, evolve more quickly than related viruses that infect other tissues in the same hosts. Long-term nucleotide substitution rates will be calculated from members of three important RNA virus families that have large numbers of sequences in GenBank: Caliciviridae, which include the leading cause of foodborne illness in this country, Picornaviridae, which include poliovirus, and Reoviridae, which include rotavirus, the most common cause of infant diarrhea worldwide. We will contrast the rates of evolution of the same gene in primarily enteric and primarily non-enteric viruses, which will allow us an apples-to-apples comparison between viruses. The BEAST software we use takes a Bayesian phylogenetic coalescent approach to calculating evolutionary rates. The accuracy of such estimates changes over different timescales, and the time to the coalescent of some of our analyses varies over an order of magnitude (i.e., some data coalesce in 70 years, others in 700 years). Since many of the enteric virus data sets coalesce more quickly than the non-enteric virus data sets, additional controls will be conducted to ensure our results are not biased by coalescent time. Our work has the potential to open up avenues of research into whether enteric tissue tropism mechanistically leads to faster rates of RNA viral evolution, and to highlight weaknesses in a widely used software program.",Effect Of Tissue Tropism On RNA Viral Evolutionary Rates: Three Family-Level Anal,2011,2013,"Duffy, Siobain Marie Deirdre","Rutgers, The State Univ of N.j.",New Brunswick,NJ,35,1,-1,5334

5R37DK048106-19,National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,24,"The goal of this application is to elucidate the molecular basis for invasion and intoxication of intestinal cells by cholera toxin (CT), the causative agent of Asiatic cholera, and for induction of innate immunity. Mucosal surfaces represent vast areas where host tissues are separated from the environment only by a delicate but highly effective single layer of columnar epithelial cells, joined by tight junctions that are impermeable to proteins and even small peptides. Here, we study how a bacterial protein breeches this barrier to enter the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and then cytosol, of host intestinal cells. To do this, the toxin co-opts a sphingolipid receptor (ganglioside GM1) and endogenous mechanisms of membrane and lipid trafficking for entry into the ER. Once in the ER, a fragment of CT, the A1-chain, then enters the cytosol by hijacking the machinery essential for protein quality control in the biosynthetic pathway, which senses and eventually degrades (by retro-translocation to the cytosol) all terminally-misfolded proteins in the ER lumen. We recently found that the intestinal cell senses entry of the A1-chain into the ER to induce an innate immune response, even when the toxin is rendered enzymatically inert, suggesting a general mechanism of innate immunity. Signal transduction in this pathway appears to be mediated by canonical sensors of ER stress, which are associated with the pathogenesis of IBD. The biology co-opted by CT to enter host cells is fundamental to intestinal cell structure and function, and clinically relevant for diverse human diseases in addition to the toxigenic diarrheas. This project proposes to continue 22 years of focused research. We will use biochemical, molecular, cell biological, and genetic approaches to: explain how GM1 sphingolipids and CT-GM1 complexes traffic to the ER and other destinations (Aim 1); analyze the processing of the toxin by the ER, and elucidate the mechanisms for transport to the cytosol, and for its induction of an innate immune response (Aim 2); and identify novel molecular components involved in all the toxin pathways using unbiased forward and reverse genetic approaches (Aim 3). We have established novel reagents and approaches to solve these problems, including: synthesis of GM1 structural isoforms for direct structure-function studies on sphingolipid trafficking; and preparation of novel CT mutants designed to isolate the fraction of toxin within the ER lumen or to trap it in intermediate reactions to understand how the ER processes the toxin for transport to the cytosol and for induction of innate immunity. We have also developed the zebrafish for genetic studies and identified 13 families by forward screen as resistant to intoxication.

5SC1GM092781-03,National Institute of General Medical Sciences,93,"Our study is directed towards understanding the interactions that exist among the proteins that constitute the RNA polymerase portal of the cystoviruses. This molecular machine selects, packages, and replicates the viral RNA genome segments. One portal is located on each vertex of the 12-sided polymerase complex (PX) a structure that forms the viral core. This bacteriophage family constitutes a unique bacterial reovirus that serves as a simple and important molecular model for their clinically significant cousins, the Reoviridae. Our overall objective is to establish a detailed structural model for the reoviruses portal apparatus using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). We will then better understand how they replicate and package their double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) genomes. This knowledge is of critical importance in the design of antiviral pharmaceuticals for pathogenic reoviruses, in particular rotavirus, a significant cause of childhood morbidity in third world countries. My developmental and career objective is to employ a qualified research team that studies the molecular biology and structure of clinically significant viruses at the City College of New York (CCNY) Medical School. The cystovirus model offers an excellent introductory virus project that utilizes the resources for molecular and structural biology recently established at the CCNY campus in particular the New York State Foundation for Science, Technology and Innovation (NYSTAR) funded New York Structural Biology Center (NYSBC). The Gottlieb laboratory personnel have utilized the hardware and software at this new facility and have published the center's first electron-cryo- tomography paper.

5R01AI021362-28,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Rotavirus (RV) infection is the leading cause of childhood diarrheal morbidity and mortality worldwide despite the recent approval of two safe and effective live attenuated vaccines. Many fundamental questions concerning the basis of heterotypic humoral immunity, the mechanisms by which RV elicits but also avoids the innate immune response, and the factors controlling tissue tropism, systemic replication, and host range restriction remain to be answered. In this proposal, we will use a series of related and complementary approaches to characterize the mechanisms by which specific components of the virus and the host immune systems interact to either enhance or restrict RV replication and pathogenesis in the host. These aims are to:  1) Define the clonal and structural basis of heterotypic humoral rotavirus immunity in humans. Heterotypic (serotype cross-reactive) immunity plays an important role in preventing RV disease and is a critical contributor to the efficacy of at least one of the two currently licensed RV vaccines. Heterotypic humoral immunity is also a key component of several established (e.g., influenza) and experimental (e.g., HIV and HCV) vaccines. We propose to define, at the individual immunoglobulin (Ig) molecule level, the serologic nature of heterotypic neutralizing reactivity and the structural basis for this reactivity. Our hypothesis is that humans circumvent the serotypic diversity of circulating RV strains by developing lg molecules directed at VP4, VP7, and VP6 that mediate heterotypic protection.  2) Identify RV genes responsible for variation between strains in their ability to replicate systemically and cause systemic disease and characterize the link between interferon (IFN) interference and cellular tropism. RV spreads and replicates systemically although strains vary substantially in both the level and sequaelae of the systemic phase of infection. IFN signaling appears to play an important role in regulating systemic replication of different RV strains. We will determine, in vivo, which RV genes are responsible for the variation in systemic replication capacity and distinct organ specificity of different RV strains and investigate how the strain-dependent effects of NSP1 on IFN signaling affect this cell tropism and host range. Our hypothesis is that the NSP1 protein (gene 5 product), through its host-specific inhibitory effects on IFN signaling, plays an important, but not exclusive role in regulating cell tropism and systemic RV replication.  3) Characterize the interaction of murine plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) with RV and determine the contribution of pDC-derived interferon to restricting RV infection. Recent studies in humans and animals demonstrated that RV infection is not limited to the mature epithelial tip cells of the small bowel but also occurs in other cells at other sites, including DCs. pDCs are a primary source of the host anti- viral IFN response and studies by us and others provide support for the notion that IFN is an important regulator of RV pathogenesis that specifically functions to restrict systemic replication. Here we will characterize the interaction between murine pDCs and RV in vitro and use an in vivo mouse model to determine the role of pDCs in restricting systemic replication as well as B cell activation. Our hypothesis is that RV interaction with pDCs plays a critical role in restricting systemic RV replication and that pDCs, unlike many other host cells, are capable of circumventing RV's inherent ability to block the induction of IFN.

As part of the Columbia University SRP, we established the Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study (HEALS)&#191;a large prospective cohort study based on individual-level data among a population exposed to a wide range of inorganic As from drinking water in Araihazar, Bangladesh. Over the past 12 years, using a population-based sampling frame, we recruited >24,000 men and women (with >95% response rates) and collected detailed questionnaires, clinical data, and biospecimen samples at baseline recruitment as well as every two years subsequently. Approximately 80% of participants are exposed to water As at low-to moderate doses (0-150 pg/L) with nearly 75% exposed at <100 pg/L. Through a dedicated medical clinic established by Columbia University and The University of Chicago that exclusively serves the HEALS participants, we have also developed an effective mechanism of following the cohort, especially for detecting incidence of respiratory and cardiovascular disorders. In this proposal, with up to 17 years follow-up, we propose to prospectively evaluate the effects of various measures of As exposure and methylation capacity on: i) all-cause, chronic-disease and cancer-related mortalities; ii) incidence of total and subtypes of chronic non-malignant respiratory disease (CNRD) including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, restrictive lung disease, and pulmonary tuberculosis; iii) incidence of total and subtypes of cardiovascular disease (CVD)  including coronary heart disease and stroke and also CVD subclinical marker carotid artery intima-medial thickness; and, finally to identify iv) modifiable host factors that influence these associations.

5R01AI081924-04,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Disease caused by the obligate intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii is inherently linked to fast replication cycles of the tachyzoite life stage. Tachyzoite division produces two daughters per division round, which are assembled within the mother cell through a unique 'internal budding' process. Assembly of the peripheral cytoskeleton drives budding and serves as a scaffold for organelle assemblage and segregation. The cytoskeleton is composed of microtubules together with two unique elements not shared with the host (intermediate filaments in complex with flattened vesicles together called the inner membrane complex or IMC). This proposal aims to characterize a unique component of the replication machinery, the intermediate filament cytoskeleton. To date, four different filament genes have been studied (TgIMC1-4), but a preliminary genomic survey identified 16 genes in total. Preliminary studies of several filaments throughout development identified a surprising spectrum in behavior and hint at a thus far underappreciated sophistication of the intermediate cytoskeleton. Therefore the research team proposes to assess the localization, post-translation modification, and proteolytic processing of all 16 genes throughout parasites division (Aim 1). Furthermore, preliminary data identifies protein TgMORN1 as a central organizer between two filament structures (the IMC and the posterior cup), which also provides a scaffold for the constriction of the cytoskeleton during maturation. The pivotal role of TgMORN1 will be further dissected by identifying the proteins in the large TgMORN1 complex (Aim 2). Finally, we want to construct a model of the process wherein morphological changes during the division process can be linked to biochemical events (Aim 3). Upon completion of this proposal, understanding on the who, when, where and how of the assembly, maturation, stability and turnover of the intermediate filament cytoskeleton will allow predictions on how to best interfere with division, providing a rational basis for development of new therapeutics to treat toxoplasmosis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Limited treatment options are available to treat disease caused by Apicomplexa.

However, changes in fish are slow to manifest as a consequence of a remedial action and often one has to wait for several years to see such change. To make timely assessments of remediation progress, one alternative is to perform appropriate measurements that indicate changes in key pathways of exposure to fish. Although some advances have been made recently to assess porewater concentrations using passive sampling techniques which respond more rapidly to in-situ remedies, relationship of such measures to accumulation is fish has not been demonstrated. Also, there is a major gap in the development and utilization of fate and biouptake models that can use passive sampling measurements and quantitatively link those measurements to uptake pathways and predict eventual changes in fish concentrations. This proposed research project will refine sampling methods to assess PCB uptake pathways and work with practitioners to incorporate such measures into PCB fate and biouptake models to assess changes in fish concentration over time, and validate the approach through controlled laboratory exposure studies and measurements in the field. The three primary aims of this project are: Specific aim 1: Develop the fundamental basis of passive sampling. This research will use advanced fluorescence microscopy, IR microspectroscopy, and sectioning techniques to directly measure the diffusion of organic molecules in commonly used passive sampler materials (polyethylene, polyoxymethylene, and PDMS). This effort will lead to the selection and use of appropriate polymeric materials for passive equilibrium sampling with much greater confidence about the nature of equilibrium achieved during the exposure period. Specific aim 2: Use passive sampling to measure bioavailability processes and uptake in fish. This research aim will evaluate how sediments amended with activated carbon sorbents in the field impact PCB biouptake in two types of fish through controlled laboratory mesocosm studies and compare with uptake in passive sampling devices developed under Aim 1. Specific aim 3: Incorporate passive sampling inputs to PCB fate and bioaccumulation model. A mathematical model will be developed and used to interpret results from: 1) the mesocosm exposure experiments, and 2) field observations from a PCB-impacted river site to explore the effect of activated carbon treatments on PCB accumulation in fish.

5R01ES013781-05,National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences,25,"Chronic exposure to trivalent arsenic (As III) is well known to cause cardiovascular diseases. In the human liver, As (III) promotes vascular remodeling, portal fibrosis, and hypertension, but the molecular pathophysiology of these As III-induced vascular changes is unknown. In general, the pathogenesis of As III induced vascular diseases has been understudied, in part, due to a lack of relevant animal models sensitive to chronic low dose As III effects. Our preliminary results show that exposure of intact adult mice to as low as 10 ppb of As III in their drinking water caused defenestration and capillarization of liver sinusoidal endothelium (LSEC). Furthermore, we also show that primary, short term cultures of murine or human LSEC are useful in revealing functional roles for As (III)-stimulated NADPH oxidase (NOX) generation of reactive oxygen species in the early signaling events affecting phenotype (e.g. fenestration) of this important target cell. The objective of the proposed studies is to use these in vivo and ex vivo models to investigate the mechanisms through which As (III) initiates LSEC remodeling and the molecular pathology of As (III)-induced vascular diseases. The global hypothesis for these studies states that As (III) acts at the level of g-protein coupled cell signaling to promote NOX oxidant generation that disrupts maintenance of LSEC fenestrations and suppression of capillarization. Accordingly, the specific aims of this proposal are to determine: I. the molecular mechanism by which As (III) causes liver sinusoidal capillarization and remodeling in intact mice. Wildtype and NOX deficient (p47phox -/-) mice will be exposed to As (III) (10-50 ppb) for 2 weeks and morphometric (light and electron microscopic level) determinants of SEC defenestration and capillarization will be quantified. Pharmacologically (antibodies to vascular endothelial cell growth factor receptor or Pertussis toxin) modified mice will be used to assess the contribution VEGF receptor and Gi-protein linked signaling to As III-induced vascular changes. II. the role of NOX generated superoxide in mediating As III-induced phenotypic conversion of primary murine and human LSEC. LSEC isolated from human liver or wildtype and p47phox -/- mice will be exposed to As (III) ex vivo to demonstrate mechanisms through which an imbalance of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species generation mediates AsIII-dysregulation of VEGF receptor maintained LSEC fenestration. III. if an imbalance in LSEC GT Pase activity mediates As (III) stimulated remodeling of the LSEC.

The MARTX toxin of V. cholerae (MARTX-Vc) contributes to virulence in mice and may be an important factor contributing to persistent colonization both in cholera patients and non-symptomatic carriers.. MARTX-Vc is of intrinsic interest due to its novel biochemical properties and mode of action. At a predicted size of >480 kDa, the toxin is a multifunctional toxin. Thus far, we have described three activities associated with this toxin. We have demonstrated that this toxin depolymerizes actin stress fibers and covalently crosslinks actin into oligomers. We have demonstrated that this toxin causes rounding of cells due to inactivation of RhoGTPases by an unknown mechanism. Finally, this toxin has a cysteine protease domain with autoprocessing activity that may also have cellular targets resulting in cytotoxicity. Each of these activities has been mapped to a specific domain of the toxin. A fourth domain homologous to the alpha-beta hydrolase family of proteins is also a putative activity domain. In this grant proposal, we will pursue the multiple catalytic activities of the toxin by studying the mechanism of action of the independent activity domains. A structure   function analysis of the actin crosslinking domain will be performed and the regions essential for catalysis and actin binding will be identified. The target of the RhoGTPase inactivating domain will be identified and characterized. The requirements for autocleavage site recognition and inositol hexakisphosphate binding will be investigated and other potential sites of cleavage identified.

This proposal seeks to understand the cellular mechanism of action of this toxin that has three known enzymatic activities: actin crosslinking, Rho-inactivation, and autoprocessing. Completion of this research will impact not only our understanding of cholera pathogenesis, but also the function of other uncharacterized toxins produced by other human pathogens that share these unique enzymatic activities.",Genetic And Biochemical Study Of V.

5R01AI054961-08,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Toxoplasma gondii is a widespread apicomplexan parasite that causes severe disease in the congenitally-infected fetus and in immunocompromised persons. T. gondii uses a unique form of gliding motility to invade host cells and disseminate through the body during infection, and motility is essential to parasite virulence. The machinery that powers gliding motility is well conserved in apicomplexan parasites, but very little is known about how the unconventional myosin motor protein at the heart of the motility machinery is regulated. A recent high-throughput screen identified 24 novel small-molecule inhibitors and six enhancers of host cell invasion by T. gondii. Strikingly, 21 of the 24 small molecules that inhibit invasion were found to inhibit parasite motility, and all six of the invasion enhancers enhance parasite motility. This proposal is focused on the detailed mechanism of action of one of the most promising of the motility inhibitors, compound 115556.  When compound 115556 is added to T. gondii, it causes the single myosin light chain (TgMLC1) associated with the myosin motor that drives motility (TgMyoA) to undergo a pronounced electrophoretic mobility shift, due to an as yet uncharacterized posttranslational modification. Isolated T. gondii motor complexes containing the modified TgMLC1 show decreased motor activity in an in vitro motility assay. In the course of this work, TgMLC1 was also shown to be phosphorylated and dimethylated. The central hypothesis of this project is that posttranslational modifications of TgMLC1, including the modification induced by 115556, regulate the function of the TgMyoA motor and parasite motility.  The Specific Aims of the project are to: (1) Determine the nature of the 115556-induced modification to TgMLC1 and its effect on TgMyoA function and directly test the hypothesis that the 115556-induced modification of TgMLC1 is responsible for the inhibition of parasite motility by the compound; (2) Identify the target of 115556. The preliminary data suggest that 115556 does not bind to and act directly on TgMLC1. The direct target of 115556 will be identified, and the pathway connecting this target to the modification of TgMLC1 elucidated; (3) Determine the functional consequences of TgMLC1 phosphorylation and methylation on TgMyoA activity and parasite motility, and establish whether any of the other motility inhibitors or enhancers identified in the high-throughput screen act through phosphorylation or methylation of TgMLC1.  This work will provide new insights into the proteins and pathways involved in the motility and invasion of host cells by T. gondii. A greater understanding of how motility is regulated in T. gondii and other apicomplexan parasites is likely to lead to new chemotherapeutic approaches to treating the devastating diseases these parasites cause.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Toxoplasma gondii is an important human pathogen and a valuable model organism for other closely related but less experimentally accessible parasites, such as those that cause malaria and cryptosporidiosis. The goal of this project is to understand how the motility of T. gondii is regulated, at the level of the unconventional myosin motor protein that the parasite uses to force its way into cells of its host and disseminate through the body during infection. Parasite motility is essential for virulence, so an increased understanding of how the myosin motor protein is regulated may lead to new chemotherapeutic strategies to treating the diseases caused by this important group of human pathogens.",Small Molecule Approaches To Studying T.

5R21NS071160-02,National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke,96,"Historically the brain was considered an immune-privileged site with little immune- surveillance. We now understand that there is continuous surveillance but that inflammatory responses need to be tightly controlled. Although the mechanisms of this control have been extensively researched the focus has been primarily on the entry of cells and less about the control of inflammation once present in the brain. Toxoplasma gondii is one of the most common human infections in the world with prevalence rates in the USA at 10-30% and with 80% of people infected in parts of Europe and South America. This protozoan parasite leads to a chronic infection in the CNS with a continuous inflammatory response required in the brain to maintain latency as demonstrated in immune-compromised individuals who succumb to Toxoplasmic encephalitis. Yet there is no apparent pathology related to this continuous presence of inflammation in the brain. Thus, T. gondii leads to an immune response in the brain robust enough to provide protection against the parasite but sufficiently controlled to prevent immunopathology. This enables investigations into the mechanisms that achieve a well-balanced immune response in the CNS. This proposal investigates the control of T cell migration within the brain during infection. Recent studies of ours have demonstrated that following infection; the presence of a reticular network is formed on which T cells migrate. To elucidate the mechanism involved in this migration experiments will be conducted looking at a secreted glycoprotein called secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC). This molecule has been associated with developmental processes in the CNS, extracellular matrix deposition and increased cell migration in the periphery, however has not previously been demonstrated during inflammatory responses in the brain. Following Toxoplasma infection there is a significant increase in SPARC in the CNS associated with parasites and inflammation. This proposal tests the hypothesis that SPARC is necessary and facilitates leukocyte migration in the brain during the immune response to Toxoplasma. Understanding how peripheral cells are directed to the site of infection and still prevent immunopathology in the CNS has direct relevance to controlling infectious pathogens that affect the brain. In addition, it may also lead to novel mechanisms to counter the inflammation that is prevalent and causative in many neurodegenerative diseases.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal investigates the regulation of the inflammatory response in the brain during Toxoplasma infection. This is one of the most common human pathogens however, in the absence of an appropriate immune response can lead to fatal encephalitis.

5R01AI054693-10,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"The goal of this project is to analyze functions essential to the reproduction and pathogenesis of the intestinal parasite and basal eukaryote, Giardia intestinalis. G. intestinalis belongs to the earliest known diverging lineage of eukaryotes (diplomonads), and it is a widespread intestinal parasite of humans and animals. It is one of the ten major parasites in humans, and in the USA, it is estimated that several million cases occur annually. Further, there is recent in vitro evidence of drug resistance to the widely used antigiardial, Flagyl. These observations underscore the necessity of identifying alternatives to the limited number of known antigiardial compounds, and highlight our incomplete knowledge of Giardia biology. The proposed research will establish fundamental principles governing force generation in the Giardia microtubule cytoskeleton, and will test how selected kinesins (microtubule motors) promote mitosis, ventral disc function and assembly, and karyogamy and automixis during encystation. We hypothesize that the evolutionarily conserved kinesins are involved in conserved processes (for example, mitosis), whereas the novel kinesins are involved in novel functions such askaryogamy during encystation. We have developed new molecular tools for studying kinesin function in Giardia. Analysis of a dominant negative rigor mutant of kin13 demonstrates that it is a master regulator of interphase and mitotic microtubule dynamics, and along with the two kin2 representatives regulates flagellar length. Our approach includes an analysis of kinesin localization in Giardia to prioritize candidates for further study (Aim 1), and an in-depth study of selected kinesin functions using a genetic and biochemical approach. (Aims 1-3). We will continue to investigate the mechanism of mitosis in Giardia, extending our analysis to living cells. The giardial mitotic kinesins under investigation in aim 2 are essential for reproduction and will be prime candidates for chemical genetic screens for small molecule inhibitors of kinase ATPase activity. This analysis will also provide an important evolutionary perspective on kinesin function during mitosis. In specific aims 3 and 4 we will investigate nuclear behavior during encystation that leads to cell and nuclear fusion and automixis. . Automixis may be essential for maintenance of genome stability and evolution of drug resistance, and therefore is a target for drug discovery. We will determine whether kinesins contribute to cell and nuclear movement and fusion (aim 3) and whether processes related to homologous recombination occur after fusion (aim 4). These results will be validated by infecting animal models with cells containing integrated selectable markers.

5R01CA075449-16,National Cancer Institute,99,"Polycyclic aromatic amines, heterocylic amines and nitroarenes are environmental carcinogens that are present in many cooked and broiled foods, notably meats, products of fuel combustion such as diesel exhaust, tobacco smoke, cooking oil fumes, coffee, tea and spices, and polluted air and water. Cancer is initiated when metabolites of these chemicals form DNA lesions that cause mutations during replication. Among the plethora of DNA adducts, it is essential to identify the most hazardous ones for purposes of biomonitoring and assessing the exposure risk of individuals to environmental carcinogens. Biomonitoring will be greatly improved by concentrating on those adducts that are the most persistent ones in vivo. We are focusing on a group of aromatic amine-, heterocyclic amine- and nitroarene-derived DNA adducts of varying sizes and shapes that stem from these metabolically activated environmental carcinogens. They have been identified in human cells and fluids, and in animal cells and tissues. We will investigate DNA adducts to dG-N2 that have been largely overlooked, but are often persistent in animal studies and adducts to dG-C8, for which animal studies suggest repair susceptibility in a number of cases. Our central hypothesis is that those adducts that entirely escape nucleotide excision repair (NER) are critical ones, as they will gradually accumulate in our DNA and cause cancer-initiating mutations. Our long-term goal is to determine the properties of adducts that govern repair resistance and susceptibility, and identify those adducts that resist NER. Our three Specific Aims test the hypothesis that the linkage site to guanine, the size and shape of the aromatic ring system and the sequence context of the adducts are the key factors that determine their NER susceptibility. We will utilize innovative molecular modeling approaches to elucidate the properties of the DNA lesions and determine the characteristics responsible for repair resistance or susceptibility. We will work hand-in-hand with our long-term collaborator N. Geacintov, who will perform NER studies with human HeLa cell extracts for our adducts. Our underlying hypothesis is that lesion-induced local stabilization of the DNA duplexes is the fundamental property that determines the NER resistance of a given lesion. Prior work has demonstrated, using melting points of duplexes as indicators of stability, that repair resistant adducts either cause minor stability decreases or stabilize modified double-stranded DNA. In contrast, DNA lesions that elicit NER are thermally destabilizing. We will investigate the adducts in uncomplexed DNA as well as when complexed with histone proteins in nucleosomes, the fundamental DNA-organization unit in the cellular environment. Our studies will provide the next-generation of biomarkers for exposure and risk of developing cancer, facilitate design of better NER-resistant chemotherapeutics through our gained understanding of NER mechanisms, and advance our capability for genotoxic screening of adducts derived from the polycyclic aromatic amines, heterocylic amines and nitroarenes present in our environment.",Aromatic Amine-DNA Lesions: Mutagenicity And Repair,1997,2016,"Broyde, Suse ",New York University,New York,NY,37,1,122,-1

1R01AI099493-01A1,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Cholera toxin (CT), produced by Vibrio cholerae, induces the life-threatening diarrhea of cholera. CT travels as an intact AB5 protein toxin from the cell surface to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of an intoxicated cell. The catalytic A1 subunit then dissociates from the rest of the toxin, unfolds, and passes through an ER translocon pore to reach its cytosolic Gsa target. Translocation into the cytosol is facilitated y the quality control system of ER-associated degradation (ERAD). Most ERAD substrates are extracted from the ER through a mechanism involving the cytosolic AAA ATPase p97. However, p97 appears to play a minimal role in CTA1 translocation. The overall goal of this project is to define the molecular mechanism for CTA1 translocation and its subsequent activation in the cytosol. We recently reported that the cytosolic chaperone Hsp90 is required for CTA1 passage into the cytosol. This work established a new role for Hsp90 in the extraction of a soluble ERAD substrate from the ER. Hsp90 works with Hop and Hsc70 to refold client proteins. Based upon our published and preliminary data, we hypothesize Hsp90, Hop, and Hsc70 form a core translocase complex that directly facilitates CTA1 translocation to the cytosol. We further predict the Hsp90/Hsc70-assisted refolding of disordered proteins is linked to their translocase function: by coupling translocation with refolding, Hsp90 and Hsc70 would prevent the (re)folded CTA1 protein from sliding back into the translocon pore. This process would provide the driving force for CTA1 translocation. We also predict the Hsp90/Hsc70-assisted refolding of CTA1 will place the cytosolic toxin in a conformation that can be activated by host ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs). Finally, we predict the Hsp90/Hop/Hsc70 complex is also involved with the ER-to-cytosol export of other toxins and endogenous ERAD substrates that utilize a p97-independent translocation pathway. In this application, we will (i) define the core components of the translocase complex and their binding sites on CTA1; (ii) demonstrate the refolding function of the translocase complex and examine its potential effect on ARF-stimulated toxin activity; and (iii) identify a broader range of toxins and endogenous ERAD substrates for the translocase complex. Our structure / function analysis of the translocase complex will employ a unique combination of molecular microbiology, cell biology, and biophysics. This project will provide molecular insight into the poorly understood process of CTA1 translocation and will define a new route for the ER-to-cytosol export of ERAD substrates.

An estimated four to six million deaths per year worldwide are caused by bacterial-induced diarrhea and the associated dehydration represents the second most common cause of infant mortality around the world. Enteric bacterial infections and diarrhea are also an important public health concern for travelers and US Forces overseas. The goals of this proposal are to interrogate the influence of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) in the regulation of innate and adaptive immunity following enteric bacterial infection. Employing Citrobacter rodentium, an experimental model of human enteropathogenic and enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EPEC or EHEC) infection, our preliminary studies identified a role for IL-23-dependent IL-22 in innate immunity to infection. The dominant cellular source of IL-23-dependent IL-22 in Citrobacter-infected mice was a population of ROR3t-positive ILCs that expressed c-kit and CD90, and in vivo depletion of ILCs in Citrobacter-infected Rag-/- mice was associated with a defect in protective innate immunity to infection. ILCs expressed the thymic stromal lymphopoietin receptor (TSLPR) and deletion of TSLPR resulted in exaggerated ILC responses and enhanced immunity to Citrobacter, indicating that TSLP inhibits ILC-dependent innate immunity in vivo. In addition, a sub-population of ILCs expressed MHC class II and costimulatory molecules and could promote T cell proliferation in vitro, suggesting that these cells also have the capacity to promote T cell-dependent immunity in vivo. Employing selective in vivo depletions, adoptive transfers and cell lineage-specific deletion strategies, three specific aims of this project will determine (i) what signals promote ILC responses in vivo and what is their role in innate immunity to Citrobacter, (ii) how TSLP-TSLPR interactions inhibit ILC responses and innate immunity, and (iii) how ILC-intrinsic MHC class II expression influences CD4pos T cell responses and immunity to Citrobacter. The results of these studies will provide a framework to test the therapeutic potential of manipulating ILC responses in the promotion of anti-bacterial immunity and the treatment of intestinal inflammation. We anticipate that defining the contribution of ILCs to anti-bacterial immunity will direct future clinical efforts to boost innate immunity in the context of human conditions involving immunodeficiency including HIV, cancer and transplantation, to improve the efficacy of oral vaccines, and to dampen ILC responses and reduce chronic inflammation in diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease.",Regulation And Function Of Innate Lymphoid Cells In The Gut,2011,2015,"Artis, David ",University of Pennsylvania,Philadelphia,PA,45,1,210,4821

Entamoeba histolytica is a Category B NIH Biodefense pathogen due to its low infectious dose and food and water-bone transmission, and an important cause of diarrhea in children in Africa, Asia and Latin America. The candidate vaccine antigen is the LecA domain of the E. histolytica Gal/GalNAc lectin that mediates parasite adherence and contact-dependent cytotoxicity. LecA contains all of the virulence neutralizing antibody epitopes of the native Gal/GalNAc lectin, and in fact a surrogate marker of immunity in children is intestinal IgA against LecA. Feasibility of our approach is underscored by the effectiveness of LecA in many investigators' laboratories as a vaccine in rodent models of amebiasis.  Innovative aspects of the proposed research include production of the first vaccine against an enteric parasite, the use of an antigen (LecA) where virulence-neutralizing epitopes have been mapped, and utilization of the novel mouse model of amebic colitis for efficacy studies.  Our approach will be to conduct preclinical development of the LecA vaccine formulated in alum. Preliminary studies published from our group have demonstrated the effectiveness of this prototype vaccine in the murine model. Two specific aims are proposed to conduct this work: In Specific Aim 1, we will express and purify from E. coli the LecA fragment of the Gal/GalNAc lectin using standard operating procedures that are scalable to cGMP. We will quality control the purified protein for endotoxin, DNA, and contaminating host cell proteins, absorb it to alum and test its stability and lot-to-lot variability.

3R01AI048082-07S1,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Giardia lamblia, which is spread by the fecal-oral route, is an important parasitic cause of diarrhea in the US and the developing world. The infectious and diagnostic stage of Giardia is the quadranucleate cyst, which has a wall composed in part by fibrils of a unique GalNAc homopolymer. During the previous funding period, we have made many discoveries concerning glycosylation of Giardia proteins (Aim 1) and the formation of the cyst wall (Aim 2).  These discoveries have suggested two related hypotheses that will be pursued in the proposed experiments. First, protein glycosylation in Giardia is much simpler than that of the human host or of model eukaryotes such as Saccharomyces. Therefore studies of Giardia glycans in Aim 1 will provide insights concerning the diversity and evolution of protein glycosylation, as well as providing a better description of Giardia glycoproteins. The second hypothesis is that the cyst wall of Giardia is composed of a small number of proteins, which are lectins that bind fibrils of the GalNAc homopolymer. Studies in Aim 2 that characterize enzymes involved in synthesis and degradation of the Giardia cyst wall will lead to insights into the mechanism of pathogenesis of this parasite and provide an alternative wall model that is distinct from those of fungi that contain multiple sugar polymers and ~100 proteins.  Progress towards Aim 1 included demonstration that Giardia makes a 2-sugar N-glycan precursor rather than the 14-sugar precursor made by metazoans and fungi. The Giardia oligosaccharyl transferase (OST) that transfers N-glycans has a single subunit rather than 8 subunits. There is selection for sites of N- linked glycans in eukaryotes with N-glycan-dependent quality control (QC) of protein folding, but there is no such selection in Giardia.UDP-GlcNAc is the only nucleotide-sugar transported into the ER lumen of Giardia. Proposed experiments towards Specific Aim 1 will characterize the single-subunit OST of Giardia and characterize what we predict is a unique GPI anchor of Giardia. Progress toward Aim 2 included use of wheat germ agglutinin, which binds to the Giardia N-glycans, to dramatically enrich secreted and membrane proteins. Cyst-specific glycoproteins included a candidate for the GalNAc homopolymer synthase. The GalNAc homopolymer, which was isolated free of protein, maintains its hollow spherical shape based upon interlocking loops of curled fibrils. The Leu-rich repeat domain of the Giardia cyst wall protein 1 is a lectin that binds the GalNAc homopolymer. Proposed experiments towards Specific Aim 1 will explore further a curled fibril and lectin model of the Giardia cyst wall, isolate the synthase for the unique GalNAc homopolymer, and characterize the glycohydrolase that breaks down the GalNAc polymer during excystation.

5U19AI044236-14,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Food allergy affects over 11 million Americans and is most prevalent in young children, with 6% - 8% of  children less than 3 years of age experiencing some form of food hypersensitivty. Milk allergy is the most  common cause of food hypersensitivity in infants and young children, typically develops in the first year of  life, affects 2.5% of infants in industrialized countries, and is outgrown in about 80% of children by 6 years  of age. IgE-mediated allergy accounts for about 70% of milk allergic disorders, i.e. 1.8% of young infants,  and often is a harbinger of future atopic disorders and other food allergies.Despite an increased  understanding of IgE-mediated immunopathology, no successful therapeutic measures have been  developed to prevent or reverse food allergies. The overall goal of this Center is to elucidate further  underlying immunologic mechanisms of milk allergy and to develop safe and effective forms of therapy.  The Administrative Core will facilitate this effort by providing the organizational backbone for this Center,  monitoring clincal trials, providing biostatistical support for all projects, and coordinating interactions within  and outside the Center, e.g. NIAID, other AADCR Centers and the external Scientific Review Committee.  This wll be achieved through the following Specific Aims:  Aim #1: Facilitate communication and interaction between Projects 1-3, assist in subject recruitment and  retention, and provide clinical monitoring, database support and biostatistical support for all projects.  Aim #2: Implement an external Scientific Review Committee with independent experts in the field of food  allergy and immunotherapy.  Aim #3: Provide mechanisms for communicating with other members of the AADCR Centers.  Aim #4: Oversee resource and data sharing between this project and other members of the AADCR Centers.  The Administrative Core will provide manegerial support, organizational support for monthly internal  project review meetings, quarterly inter-project meetings of Pi's and key personnel, quarterly AADCRC  Steering Committee teleconferences, bienniel Scientific Advisory Committee teleconferences, and annual  AADCRC PI meetings in Bethesda.

5R01AI022021-29,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Toxins that modify targets within the cytosol of mammalian cells are crucial virulence factors in anthrax, diphtheria, botulism, cholera and many other bacterial diseases. While all toxins of this class must cross a membrane to reach their intracellular targets, we still do not have a clear understanding of the membrane translocation event for any such toxin. Anthrax toxin translocates its two enzymic moieties, Lethal Factor (LF) and Edema Factor (EF), to the cytosol of mammalian cells through a heptameric pore formed in the endosomal membrane by the Protective Antigen (PA) moiety. We have replicated the translocation event to a good ap- proximation in a model membrane system (planar phospholipid bilayers) and shown that the PA pore acts as an active transporter, rather than simply a water-filled conduit. We identified a crucial structural feature of the pore, dubbed the Phe clamp and formed from the seven Phenylalanine 427 residues, and showed that the pH gradient across the membrane is the primary energy source for translocation. Further, a Brownian ratchet model was put forth to explain translocation in physical chemical terms. In the coming grant period we will study the interaction of the pore with its polypeptide translocation substrates using a variety of approaches. The properties of the N-terminal translocation leader (TL) peptide of LF that are important for initiating translo- cation will be determined, and the location of the leader peptide in the pore will be mapped. We will probe the role of the Phe clamp in translocation and the basis of the dominant-negative phenotype elicited by mutations at Phe427 and other sites in the pore. The structure of the pore will be investigated by electron microscopy and crystallography, and various other approaches will be used to analyze the conformational transition of the prepore to the pore. This research will elucidate a key step in the action of an important bacterial toxin at a level of detail not yet attained with any other toxin; and it will strengthen the foundation for applying toxins to medical applications.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will elucidate the structure and mode of action of anthrax toxin, an important bacterial toxin. We will seek an understanding, at a level of detail not yet attained with any other toxin, of how the enzymatic components of anthrax toxin enter mammalian cells via a pore formed in a cellular membrane.

5U54AI057141-09,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"The proposed work will explore the genetic basis for real-world variability in the behavior of human  pathogens during infections of individual humans and whole populations. The focus will be on two gramnegative  pathogens, Burkholderia pseudomallei and Shigella dysenteriae, both of which cause infectious  diseases associated with substantial mortality in humans. B. pseudomallei is an opportunistic pathogen that  causes melioidosis, a disease largely found in Southeast Asia and Northern Australia; it has been classified  as a select agent because of its perceived potential as a biowarfare agent. S. dysenteriae causes dysentery  epidemics, predominantly in developing countries, which cause substantial mortality, particular in children.  The basic hypothesis behind the proposed work is that genetic changes occurring during individual B.  pseudomallei infections or during S. dysenteriae epidemics will reveal the selective pressures operating on  these species as a result of host defenses, treatment, and&#191;in the case of S. dysenteriae&#191;the dynamic  changes in the characteristics of the host population within which the epidemic is spreading. A better  understanding of the molecular basis for these genetic effects may suggest new approaches to the clinical  and public-health management of the diseases. The project has a major technical component since,  although new-generation-sequencing technology is opening up the opportunity for studies of the type  proposed, key aspects of the technology remain underdeveloped. We place particular emphasis on  improvements in the rapidity with which new base-pair-accurate, finished genome sequences can be  produced for the index strains of particular infections or epidemics. These reference sequences play a key  in role in the experimental and computational methods used to detect the genetic changes that occur during  infections and epidemics.",Bacterial Genomic Diversity,,,"Jacobs, Michael ",University of Washington,Seattle,WA,56,1,224,-1
5R01AI055058-09,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Vibrio cholerae is a facultative pathogen and the causative agent of cholera. Hallmarks of the disease include profuse watery diarrhea resulting from the action of secreted cholera toxin, and deadly, explosive outbreaks. The strong link between epidemics and human overcrowding in areas with untreated drinking water suggests an efficient mode of fecal-oral transmission via an aquatic intermediate. In support of this notion, we discovered that V. cholerae exit cholera victims in a heightened state of transmissibility (referred to as hyperinfectivity), which persists for several hours after shedding into pond water. Knowledge of the molecular basis for this phenotype, and a general characterization of this transmissible form of V. cholerae, would contribute to the design of vaccines to prevent cholera at the initial stage of infection. In prior work, we discovered that motility in the absence of chemotaxis is one determinant of hyperinfectivity. To identify additional determinants aiding in transmission, we measured global transcriptional changes in human-shed V. cholerae during the transition to an aquatic microcosm. This analysis revealed a number of regulators and effectors that potentially contribute to cholera transmission. In related work, we used a genetic selection to identify genes that are `pre-induced' at late stages of infection and which subsequently play roles in the transition of V. cholerae to aquatic environments. In Aims 1 and 2 of this project, we propose to determine if genes regulated late in infection or in cholera stool play important roles in the transition to pond water and in hyperinfectivity. Transcriptional regulators with important roles in these phenotypes will be further analyzed by transcriptional profiling to define their corresponding regulons. In Aim 2, we also propose to measure and correlate changes in the transcriptome and proteome of cholera stool V. cholerae during the transition to pond water. In Aim 3, we propose to apply knowledge of the effectors of transmission to develop and test a mucosal vaccine in a mouse maternal model of immunization and challenge of pups. We hypothesize that an acellular vaccine expressing a repertoire of antigens that are stably expressed on the surface of transmissible forms of V. cholerae will provide enhanced protection to challenge by the transmissible form of this pathogen. These studies will establish a basis for understanding both the hyperinfective phenotype of V. cholerae and its transition to aquatic environments. This knowledge will enhance our understanding of transmission of this and perhaps other water-borne pathogens, helping pave the way to development of novel vaccines that target transmissible forms of facultative pathogens. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many of the diseases that afflict humans are caused by microbes transmitted via contaminated water supplies. The biology of pathogens in aquatic reservoirs and the traits they have evolved to aid in their transmission are largely unknown. Our project will use the causative agent of cholera as a model pathogen to uncover such evolved traits, and will use the knowledge gained to test a novel vaccine that targets the transmissible form of the pathogen.",Study Of Transmissible Forms Of Vibrio Cholerae,2003,2014,"Camilli, Andrew ",Tufts University Boston,Boston,MA,26,1,-1,1488

We propose to develop a vaccine against noroviruses (NVs), one of the NIAID Category B food- and water-borne priority pathogens, based on our newly discovered subviral particle, the P particle, of NVs. This P particle is spontaneously formed by 24 copies of the protrusion (P) domain of the viral capsid protein, in octahedral symmetry, with an authentic host receptor binding property, highly immunogenic, easily to produce in E. coli and yeast with extremely high yields and simple procedures for purification, and highly stable under a wide range of physic-chemical conditions, making it an excellent subunit vaccine for mucosal immunization. Four projects representing different early-to-middle product development stages will be performed to evaluate the P particle vaccine. In stage 1 we will perform in vitro and mouse immunization studies and compare different vaccination regimens of P particles by different routes with/without an adjuvant for a maximal safety and efficacy. We also will perform similar studies for proof-of-concept of the usefulness of P particle vaccine using the cell culture model of a newly discovered monkey calicivirus, the Tulane virus. In stage 2 we will characterize the antigenic variations of NVs representing different genotypes of NVs for developing a broadly reactive vaccine based on defined antigenic types (serotypes) with a cocktail or consensus vaccine approach. We also will perform genetic and antigenic analysis of the currently dominant GII-4 viruses to address a question about epochal evolution of NVs for future vaccine strategy against NVs. In stage 3 we will further characterize the safety, immunogenicity and broadness of the candidate vaccine in protection against various NVs using the gnotobiotic (Gn) pig challenge model of human NVs developed in our laboratories recently. In the last stage we will develop a fermentation bioreactor for scale up production of P particles for future evaluation of the vaccine by human volunteer challenge studies and clinical trials. NVs are genetically diverse and there is no suitable cell culture for NVs. Our cocktail/consensus vaccine approach and the procedures for evaluation of the vaccine by the surrogate neutralization assay and using the newly discovered Tulane virus and the Gn pig model are highly innovative. We are confident that a panel of lead candidates (vaccine strains) will be selected ready for future clinical trials by the conclusion of the studies in this application.",Novel Vaccine Against Norovirus,2010,2015,"Jiang, Xi ",Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr,Cincinnati,OH,41,1,-1,1509
5R01AI046675-13,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Egress from host cells is a crucial step in the life cycle of intracellular pathogens including the parasitic protozoan Toxoplasma gondii. T. gondii can cause severe disease during pregnancy or immune dysfunction, and debilitating ocular pathology in otherwise healthy people. After intracellular replication, the parasite ruptures from host cells in a manner shared by other parasites including Plasmodium. Lytic egress frees the parasite to infect new host cells but the ensuing damage also fuels inflammation and fever, hallmarks of toxoplasmosis and malaria. We recently showed that T. gondii rapid egress and fatal acute disease both depend on the timely secretion of a pore-forming protein, TgPLP1. Our finding that TgPLP1 is released from apical micronemes exposed a novel role for these regulated secretory organelles. How TgPLP1 lyses host membranes during egress is not known. The absence of such knowledge precludes strategic efforts to extinguish its activity and alter the course of infection. Our long-term goal is to understand the roles of key microneme proteins in T. gondii infection. The objective for this funding period is to determine how TgPLP1 selectively and rapidly lyses host cell membranes during egress without causing parasite self-damage. We hypothesize that TgPLP1 pore formation is dictated by the lipid composition of its target membranes, environmental factors, and specific structural features of the protein. This assertion is based on preliminary data identifying host lipid receptors targeted for selective lysis, potential roles for pH and proteolysis in regulating pore formation, and conserved structural features of TgPLP1 predicted to drive membrane binding and oligomerization. The specific aims are: (1) Reveal the mechanism for selective cytolysis of host but not parasite membranes; (2) Uncover how TgPLP1 is active during egress but not during invasion; and (3) Identify the molecular basis for rapid pore formation. By providing a deeper mechanistic understanding of an essential step in the T. gondii life cycle, we expect the proposed work will create novel opportunities to interrupt infection and potentially ameliorate disease.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We seek to understand how a putative pore forming protein called TgPLP1 facilitates cell egress by the human parasite Toxoplasma gondii. TgPLP1 belongs to a family of pore forming proteins are used for both for microbial aggression and host defense.

5U01AI082190-04,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Botulism is a neurological disorder caused by an exotoxin from the organism Clostridum botulinum. The disease is characterized by progressive muscle weakness that can result in complete flaccid paralysis. Unfortunately, there is no known cure for the disorder. Botulinum neurotoxins are classified by the CDC as one of the six highest-risk threat agents for bioterrorism due to their relative ease of production, extreme potency and duration of paralytic activity. Countermeasures are needed to counteract the pathophysiology of BoNTs. To date there are no current interventions that can reverse the effects of intoxication after the toxin has reached its target inside the cell. As such the overarching goal of our proposal is to uncover molecules that can act within an intoxicated cell to provide symptomatic relief to BoNT/A. There are seven serologically distinct serotypes of BoNT, however, we will only focus on BoNT/A as it exhibits the most sustained intoxication and therefore represents the greatest threat of any of the BoNTs. Working within this framework we have taken a two-pronged approach to define such molecules. The first is based on small non-peptidic molecules that can inhibit the intracellular agent that causes neurotoxicity, a protease. For this initiative we will prepare mechanism-based inhibitors as well as team up with ASDI for the high throughput screening of the BoNT/A protease using their diversity collection and custom libraries to both discover new leads as well as enhance the potency of our previous lead compounds with confirmed anti-botulinum properties in vivo. Our second initiative relates to the discovery of molecules that will promote the release of acetylcholine in intoxicated cells. Our goal here are to find an intervention that could repair an intoxicated cell. To accomplish this aim we will take advantage of the known differences in potency based on their nerve terminal mechanism of action between BoNT/A-/E to devise a small molecule plan for neurotransmitter release from an intoxicated. In general we know relatively little about truly effective ways to counter toxin action at the 11th hour, and thus total reliance on any particular intervention is likely to be less than satisfactory. Furthermore, there is a vast difference in the time course of action of current potential antagonist and the toxin. This poses an enormous challenge in terms of discovery of agents for effective antagonism of BoNT/A poisoning. Against this backdrop our research will embrace the discovery of molecules that will provide both immediate and possible long-term relief from these neuroparalytic effects of BoNT/A. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Botulism poses an extreme threat to public health, primarily because of a complete lack of drugs available to combat this disease. Given the bioterrorism threat that botulinum neurotoxin poses, our proposal will develop new molecules to treat botulism and perform the studies needed to advance a potential drug into clinical trials.",Small Molecule Therapeutics For Botullinum Neurotoxin A,2009,2014,"Dickerson, Tobin J",Scripps Research Institute,La Jolla,CA,6,1,979,3907
8R01OD011149-02,"office of The Director, National Institutes of Health",-1,"Murine norovirus (MNV) is emerging as a potential pathogen in mice. Initially, the virus appeared to cause morbidity and mortality only in immunocompromised mice while it did not cause any clinical signs of overt diseases in immunocompetent mice. However, we found that MNV infection can induce subtle changes in immune responses even in wild type mice and that the virus alters disease phenotypes in a mouse model of bacterially induced inflammatory bowel disease. Exacerbation of IBD by MNV was partly mediated by effects on dendritic cells. Additionally, we observed that MNV infection alters the production of several inflammatory cytokines in bone marrow derived macrophages. Thus, we suggest that MNV has potential to become a major interfering variable in research studies with rodents. Unfortunately, we do not have sufficient data to determine whether this virus should be eliminated from research facilities. For our proposed studies, we will focus on effects of MNV on mouse studies of IBD as we have significant experience with IBD research and we have evidence that MNV alters IBD development/progression. First, we will determine if and how MNV infection exacerbates IBD in three commonly used models of IBD. Next, we will determine if MNV alters antigen presentation and consequently immune responses to antigens in immunologically normal as well as immunologically deficient mice by altering DCs. Finally, we will determine if MNV alters immune responses by influencing DC and macrophage functions. Proposed studies in this application will fill the gap in current knowledge to determine whether the time and effort should be invested in elimination of MNV from the research facilities.

We propose to build on 12 years of experience designing and testing methods of measuring environmentally relevant levels of exposure and factors that influence individual susceptibility to metal-related health effects. Accumulating data point to the developing fetus as particularly vulnerable to environmental insults and that early life exposures impact childhood and adult health. Thus, we propose to test the hypothesis that prenatal exposure to arsenic is associated with birth outcomes (e.g., birth weight, fetal growth restriction and gestational age) in the New Hampshire population. We also will assess whether individual variation in arsenic metabolism (based on maternal urinary metabolites, arsenic metabolism genes e.g., GSTO1, GSTO2, AS3T, PNP) and other factors (e.g., smoking, folate or polymorphisms in one carbon metabolism genes) modify these effects. We will evaluate the reliability of multiple measures of metal exposure (e.g., in drinking water, hair, nails and urine) within mothers and in mother-infant pairs. Secondarily, we will investigate the hypothesis that methylmercury intake alone or in combination with other factors influences fetal growth and gestational age. We will conduct a collaborative analysis with the NIEHS-funded New Bedford birth cohort study (adjacent to a Superfund Site) to increase statistical power. Programatically, we will: (1) test innovative strategies for the detection, characterization and interpretation of gene-environment interactions (with the Integrative Biology Core (IBC)), (2) explore dietary sources and geographic patterns of metal exposure (with Projects 7, 9), (3) provide a platform for translational molecular, genetic, and proteomic studies (for the IBC, Projects 2, 7, 8, 9) and (4) investigate the functional effects of polymorphisms in metal transporter genes (with the IBC, Projects 8, 9).

5R01CA153073-03,National Cancer Institute,99,"The purpose of this EUREKA application is to develop a multi-factorial modeling tool that can provide decision- makers information on how to set foodborne aflatoxin standards that reduce global liver cancer incidence. Liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma) is the 3rd-leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide, with an increasing incidence that parallels the rise in chronic hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C (HCV) infection. Aflatoxin is a potent hepatocarcinogen that synergizes with HBV and HCV to produce 30-fold higher liver cancer risk than either exposure alone. Aflatoxin is produced by the fungi Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus in maize and peanuts under warm climatic conditions. Hence, the global populations most at risk of aflatoxin-induced liver cancer are those who consume high levels of maize and peanuts, in less developed countries (LDCs) in the tropics and subtropics where resources to control aflatoxin are scarce. We hypothesize that computational modeling that simulates both public health effects and trade / economic consequences can provide unique insights into how regulatory standards can ameliorate global cancer burden. Over 100 nations have set standards on maximum allowable aflatoxin levels in food. These standards vary widely from nation to nation. Efforts are now being made to harmonize aflatoxin standards globally, to prevent world food trade disputes. We address the question: What should the harmonized aflatoxin standard be to best protect global health? Ironically, setting a very strict standard could result in more cancer cases, for 3 reasons:  1. Rich, food-importing countries would have limited health benefits because of low hepatitis prevalence, while food-exporting LDCs may incur excessive costs to meet such standards.  2. Limiting food export markets could increase poverty in LDCs, which would augment hunger and poor health conducive to increased hepatitis infection and liver cancer risk.  3. To preserve their export markets, Asian and African nations may attempt to export their best-quality  food and keep the most highly contaminated food domestically, raising the risk of aflatoxin consumption  and liver cancer in parts of the world that currently have the highest rates of hepatitis infection. Because conducting clinical trials is neither practical nor ethical, and retrospective data are limited, computer simulation modeling is an extremely useful technique to examine the consequences of different global aflatoxin standards on food trade and cancer incidence. A powerful attribute of the decision analytic approach to public health is the ability to evaluate several dimensions simultaneously. We seek to create an innovative modeling tool that integrates global liver cancer and hepatitis incidence, aflatoxin exposure through maize and nuts, costs, and technological changes into a single decision-analytic framework. Our specific aim is to determine the effect of selected harmonized aflatoxin standards on both global food export losses and global burden of aflatoxin-induced liver cancer, under current conditions and future scenarios.

5R01AI060767-07,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"The obligate intracellular protozoan Toxoplasma gondii is the etiological agent of toxoplasmic encephalitis that remains a major cause of death in AIDS patients. The currently available treatment for toxoplasmosis shows no efficacy against Toxoplasma long-term chronic infections, resulting in the recrudescence of active infections. New drugs are imperatively needed. During mammalian cell invasion, the parasite creates a specialized parasitophorous vacuole (PV) that is demarcated from the host cytoplasm by a unique membrane containing parasite proteins. Toxoplasma is notorious for extensively modifying the host cell and rerouting host organelles to its PV, largely for purposes of nutrient acquisition. The parasite usually establishes its 'nest' near the host peri-Golgi microtubule-organizing center. This region is at the intersection of the endocytic and biosynthetic pathways, and PV positioning in this area of the cell could facilitate the interception of vesicular traffic and satisfy parasite requirements for nutrients and lipid membranes. In support of this hypothesis, we demonstrated that T. gondii has a marked requirement for host cell lipids derived both from lysosomes (e.g. cholesterol) and the Golgi (e.g. sphingolipids). The PV does not fuse with host organelles, and the mechanisms by which the parasite retrieves lipids from endocytic and exocytic organelles are still poorly understood. The overall goal of our proposal is to decipher the molecular details of host lysosome and Golgi exploitation by Toxoplasma. We previously showed that Toxoplasma uses the host microtubular network to redirect host lysosomes to its vacuole and sequester these organelles within PV membrane invaginations formed by microtubules. This strategy allows the parasite to have access to nutrients provided by organelles of the endocytic cascade. However, extensive gaps remain in our current model. Specific Aim 1 proposes experiments to better understand the intersection of T. gondii with the host endocytic pathway. We will clarify the nature and contribution of the endocytic structures intercepted by Toxoplasma to parasite development. We will examine the molecular mechanism of implicated in host microtubule-PV interaction and PV membrane transformations for lysosome sequestration. Almost nothing is known about the role of host Golgi during Toxoplasma infection. Our preliminary data show that the parasite associates with the Golgi, fragments this organelle into Golgi ministacks that align along the PV and intercepts the Golgi vesicular trafficking by engulfing secretory vesicles into the PV. This strategy may allow the parasite to retrieve Golgi lipids from sequestered Golgi vesicles. Specific Aim 2 combines experiments to verify our hypothetic model on host- Golgi-PV interaction. We will study the mechanisms leading to host Golgi breakdown and the delivery of Golgi vesicles to the PV by identifying the host Golgi proteins that are targeted by the parasite. We will explore the connection between Golgi remodeling and lipid salvage by the parasite. Our results may raise the provocative notion of novel treatments against Toxoplasma based on interference with host organelle functions.",Host Cell Manipulation By Toxoplasma,2004,2015,"Coppens, Isabelle ",Johns Hopkins University,Baltimore,MD,25,1,97,3953
5F32AI096820-02,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Salmonella enterica is a Gram-negative pathogen of worldwide importance causing a variety of diseases including typhoid fever, enterocolitis and bacteremia. Following ingestion of contaminated products, bacteria access the human small intestine. Here, typhoidal species traverse the intestinal epithelium and are ingested by resident phagocytes. Replication and survival within innate immune cells enable Salmonella to cause systemic disease. To kill invading microbes, innate immune cells deploy reactive oxygen species, low pH and antimicrobial peptides (AMP). Amphipathic AMP interact with the bacterial cell surface inflicting membrane damage and death. Gram-negative pathogens have evolved to resist killing by AMP through modification of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) component of their outer membrane. In Salmonella, LPS modification requires the highly conserved PhoP/Q two-component system. Within macrophage phagosomes, the membrane bound PhoQ sensor kinase is activated by low pH and AMP. PhoQ activation results in phosphorylation of PhoP, a cytosolic response regulator. Activated PhoP binds DNA and directs transcription of genes involved AMP resistance. Accordingly, the PhoP/Q system is absolutely required for intracellular growth and survival of Salmonella. In contrast, several genes activated by PhoP involved in LPS modification are dispensable during infection. Therefore, additional factors controlled by PhoP must be required in vivo. Preliminary data from our lab suggests that in addition to controlling LPS modification, the PhoP/Q system regulates phospholipid content of the Salmonella membrane. Using microarray and proteomic techniques, we have identified genes strongly upregulated upon PhoP activation and likely involved in lipid metabolism. We hypothesize that together; PhoP/Q-mediated alterations in outer membrane phospholipid content and LPS contribute to AMP resistance and innate immune evasion during infection.",The Role Of PhoP/PhoQ-Regulated Phospholipid Alterations In Salmonella Pathogenes,2011,2014,"Dalebroux, Zachary ",University of Washington,Seattle,WA,56,1,224,5305

We now have very promising pilot data suggesting that key mucosal repair agents, including  alanylglutamine and arginine as well as selected candidate vaccines (from VCU and UMD collaborations),  given intranasally elicit immune responses that reduce both intensity and growth impairment from  cryptosporidial infections. Thus, our broad, long term objective is to define the optimal mucosal repair agents  and their potentially synergistic interactions with documented drivers of innate and acquired immunity to  either prevent or ameliorate cryptosporidial infections and their clinical consequences. Our specific aims will  therefore be: 1) to define the effectiveness of alanylglutamine, arginine, and APOE mimetic peptide, given  before or after cryptosporidial infection, 2) to determine the interactions and potential synergies of these  mucosal repair agents given with CpG, IMO or ClyA-pSEC vaccine vector drivers of innate immunity or with  ClyA-CVD908htr-CP15 driving adaptive immune responses; and finally 3) to compare the relative efficacies  and potential synergies of the optimal regimen defined above with the marginally effective, but best available  anti-protozoal drug nitazoxanide in both our organoid and neonatal mouse models challenged with  Cryptosporidium parasites.

New paradigms for antibiotic therapy will be contingent upon a better understanding of the basic mechanisms of in vivo pathogenesis and the complex relationship between the host and pathogen. The goal of this project is to merge the powerful fields of chemical biology and genomics and apply them to the study of Vibrio cholerae virulence regulation. We propose to identify and investigate new regulatory pathways that control virulence expression in Vibrio cholerae, the Gram-negative bacterium that causes the human diarrheal disease called cholera. As a model organism, it is a genetically tractable system for understanding bacterial pathogenesis, as evidenced by the previous successful identification of some of its virulence factors and requirements for colonization and infection. Yet, much remains unknown with regards to the organism's mechanisms to sense and respond to virulence activating stimuli within the host microenvironment. Thus, it also represents a model system for studying bacterial pathogenesis and uncovering underlying principles in pathogen response to the host microenvironment. We propose to use novel small molecules that we have identified in a high-throughput chemical screen for inhibitors of virulence gene expression in V. cholerae to probe and study in vivo regulatory mechanisms. Preliminary studies of these compounds suggest that they define novel regulatory steps that have not been previously described, including steps that involve sensing of low oxygen tension and that coregulate virulence expression and biofilm formation. We will complement these chemical biological studies with genomic approaches, including the systematic identification of genes involved in virulence regulation pathways, using comprehensive libraries that either knock-out every gene (except in vitro essential genes) or overexpress every gene. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to elucidate novel pathways of virulence regulation in the pathogen Vibrio cholerae and to understand how its interaction with the host triggers a bacterial program that ultimately results in disease and host damage.

The majority of the studies reported to date assessed persons residing in regions well-known for substantial levels of groundwater iAs contamination. A far larger global population, likely to include tens of millions of U.S. residents, are exposed to mild-moderate iAs concentrations via drinking water contamination; those less than 10 ppb iAs. Although limited, human, animal and in vitro studies suggest an increased risk for spontaneous pregnancy loss in association with exposure to mild-moderate drinking water iAs concentrations. To date, only one study, conducted from 1976-1978, targeted a population with drinking water iAs exposures less than 10 ppb, and detected a 50% increased risk for spontaneous loss of a clinically recognized pregnancy. Given the high baseline risk for the spontaneous loss of clinically recognized pregnancies among humans (i.e., 12-24%), and the widespread distribution of exposure to drinking water with mild-moderate iAs contamination even a modest increase in risk would incur a substantial number of attributable events. We propose a preliminary evaluation of associations between drinking water iAs exposure and the spontaneous loss of clinically recognized pregnancies of less than 20 weeks completed gestation, and to assess the feasibility of participant recruitment and data collection strategies at a large urban medical center in western Romania. This area of Romania is well-known for mild-moderate iAs contamination of drinking water sources providing a wide range of exposures below 10 ppb. Moreover, prenatal care is compulsory and government funded in Romania facilitating nearly complete ascertainment of the proposed study population comprised of newly pregnant women 18-44 years of age. We will employ a case-control study design with incidence density sampling of 150 cases and 150 controls matched by gestational age (1:1). Individual historical drinking water exposure data collected by nurse-administered questionnaire, augmented by laboratory iAs measures in reported drinking water sources will be used to assign exposure across critical windows for reproduction. We hypothesize that exposures to greater amounts of iAs through the consumption of drinking water at home and at the workplace, prior to and during gestation, will increase the risk for spontaneous pregnancy loss. Our proposed study will provide preliminary data to permit and evaluation of the best approach for a larger multi- site confirmatory study to address this critical data gap concerning low-moderate drinking water iAs contamination and spontaneous pregnancy loss.

The early inflammatory response elicited by S. typhimurium is beneficial to the host because it confines the infection to the gut mucosa. However, aspects of this response are also beneficial to S. typhimurium as they are exploited to successfully colonize the gut and achieve transmission to the next susceptible host. Very little is known about which mucosal inflammatory responses constitute the mucosal barrier to systemic Salmonella dissemination and which are exploited by Salmonella to colonize the gut. Our long-range goal is to understand how the intestinal mucosal barrier functions as well as how it is altered in individuals at higher risk for systemic infections. The objectives of this application are to investigate the costs and benefits of mucosal inflammation during Salmonella pathogenesis. Our central hypothesis is that a subset of cytokines, namely the TH17 cytokines, orchestrates both the mucosal barrier function that prevents systemic S. typhimurium dissemination and the inflammatory responses that are exploited by S. typhimurium and other bacteria to survive in the inflamed gut. The rationale for the proposed research is that understanding the host-pathogen interaction at the mucosal interface will lead to innovative approaches to treat and prevent infections at mucosal surfaces and to reduce the risk of bacteremia. We plan to test our hypothesis and fulfill the objectives of this application by pursuing the following specific aims: 1. Determine which components of the inflammatory response constitute the gut mucosal barrier during S. typhimurium infection. We will investigate the role of IL-17 and IL-22 in orchestrating the mucosal barrier during S. typhimurium infection. 2. Determine the mechanism of induction of lipocalin-2 during S. typhimurium infection. We will investigate the role of IL-17 and IL-22 in inducing expression of the antimicrobial peptide lipocalin-2- in the gut. 3. Determine whether resistance to lipocalin-2 facilitates colonization of the inflamed gut.

1R01AI101049-01,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Pregnant women are at high risk for invasive Salmonella infection, which can cause both maternal and fetal complications. We found that Salmonella infection in pregnant mice caused rapid fetal and maternal death due to massive bacterial proliferation in placental trophoblast cells (TBCs). In vitro, Salmonella flourished in human trophoblast-derived choriocarcinoma cells. However, there is a gap in our knowledge regarding the mechanism of increased susceptibility to Salmonella infection during pregnancy. Our long-term objective is to develop strategies that can control the outcome of intracellular infections in pregnant women. The overall objective of this application is to identify the molecular mechanisms that render TBCs highly susceptible to Salmonella. Our central hypothesis is that placental TBCs are productively infected by Salmonella and provide a unique intra- cellular niche that permits uncontrolled virulent Salmonella replication due to an ineffectie immune response, resulting in placental death. Our central hypothesis will be tested by three Specific Aims which will identify: 1) the mechanism of uncontrolled intracellular growth of Salmonella in TBCs, 2) the role(s) of IFN-?? in susceptibility of TBCs to Salmonella, and 3) the mechanism of Salmonella-induced placental inflammation. Studies will be performed in vitro using primary isolated human trophoblast cells and placental explants, and in vivo using pregnant mouse models. Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that Salmonella thrive within a unique intracellular environment of trophoblast cells. We will elucidate whether different trophoblast subpopulations of differing gestational age specifically promote Salmonella replication due to specific cell-cell interactions. We will also identify the role of bacterial injectisome virulence factors in facilitating entry into TBCs and the relative role of trophoblast phagocytosis. Lastly, we will characterize the molecular features of the intracellular environment (sub-cellular vacuole) in which Salmonella proliferates. Specific Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that trophoblastic hypo-responsiveness to IFN-?? contributes to susceptibility to Salmonella. We will test whether IFN-? pre- treatment of TBCs can contain Salmonella infection, how Salmonella modulates the JAK-STAT-1 signaling pathway in TBCs, and if knocking down negative-feedback inhibitors of IFN-?? signaling such as SOCS expression can aid resolution of TBC-Salmonella infection. Specific Aim 3 will test the working hypothesis that the mechanism of ST-induced TBC death is distinct from that encountered in other infected cells and contributes to overt inflammation. We will identify differential inflammation (IL-1?, IL-18, caspase) and/or cell death signaling (apoptosis, pyroptosis or necroptosis) as a cause of TBC susceptibility to Salmonella. Overall we expect to identify the relative importance of unique trophoblast features versus Salmonella virulence factors in destruction of the placenta.

Primary human norovirus infection does not elicit lasting protective immunity, a fact that could greatly affect the efficacy of vaccination strategies. Our long term goal is to elucidate the mechanisms by which noroviruses avoid the induction of protective immunity, ultimately translating this knowledge into successful vaccination approaches. Little is known regarding the pathogenesis of human noroviruses or the immune responses that control them because there has previously been no small animal model or cell culture system of infection. Data from our laboratory has defined the first small animal model of norovirus infection: We discovered the first murine norovirus (MNV), MNV-1, and demonstrated its cultivation in macrophages and dendritic cells in vitro. We have now used these unique models to examine norovirus pathogenesis and immunity. We have determined that MNV-1 is infectious orally and induces gastroenteritis, confirming the utility of this virus as a model to study human norovirus pathogenesis. Importantly, we have also determined that primary MNV-1 infection fails to afford protection to re-challenge with homologous virus. Thus, MNV-1 represents a valuable model with which to dissect the pathophysiological basis for the lack of lasting protection to human norovirus infection. Our specific hypothesis is that norovirus infection fails to induce protective mucosal immunity because the virus infects mucosal dendritic cells and prevents their full activation. Specifically, we will determine whether MNV-1 infection directly or indirectly inhibits dendritic cell activation and whether MNV-1 infection stimulates regulatory T cells.

It is widely accepted that most terrorist attacks are covert, and therefore the infectious agent  will be unknown until the first person becomes acutely ill and seeks medical help. The availability of an  instrument capable of detecting several agents simultaneously would greatly enhance our response to a  possible bioterror attack because of the ability to screen patients presenting with non-specific signs and  symptoms (the vast majority) or the possibility of testing based on syndromic presentation.  We have demonstrated the inexpensive fabrication and very high detectability of micron-scale retroreflectors,  and brightness modulation by gold nanoparticles and magnetic particles (for integration with sample  preparation) in an analyte-responsive manner. A few hundred 40 nm particles, or a single 2.8 urn magnetic  bead, can be reliably detected on each element of a large retroreflector array, with simple optics potentially  costing less than $1000.

The precise mechanism(s) by which EPEC causes diarrhea is currently not known. The bacteria elaborate a syringe-like type III secretion system that delivers key virulence factors directly into host intestinal epithelial cells. During the initial phase of infection, EPEC appears to specifically limit the death of the underlying epithelial cells. The focus of this proposal is the suppression of host cell death by the type III-secreted protein EspZ, which is unique to EPEC and related pathogens. Strains lacking EspZ are highly impaired for colonization and disease in animal models of infection. We hypothesize that EspZ interacts with host proteins to suppress premature death of infected enterocytes and, thereby, plays a key role in intestinal colonization by A/E pathogens. We propose to (1) validate the interaction of EspZ with host cell partners, define EspZ interaction domains, and generate specific EspZ mutants deficient for interaction(s), (2) characterize the role of EspZ and its interaction partners in activating signaling pathways that contribute to the survival of host cells, and (3) define the role of EspZ and its interaction partners in pathogenesis using animal models of infection.

The correlates of protective immunity to cryptosporidiosis in humans are poorly understood and there is little information on whether immunity to this parasite is subtype-specific. Knowledge of naturally acquired immunity to specific Cryptosporidium spp. antigens is essential to design strategies to prevent or control disease caused by this parasite.

We will then determine whether immune responses to these antigens resulting from the primary infection are associated with protection from subsequent infection. The second specific aim is to investigate subtype-specific immune responses to the polymorphic gp40 antigen. We will determine whether repeated episodes of cryptosporidiosis involve the same or different species and subtypes of Cryptosporidium. We will then determine whether immune responses to subtype-specific gp40 are associated with control of the primary infection and whether immune responses to rgp40 1a in children infected with subtype 1a in the primary infection are associated with protection from subsequent homotypic or heterotypic infection.

The majority of the childhood mortality and morbidity is due to infectious diseases, notably diarrhea,  pneumonia and malaria. These problems are associated with poverty, including insufficient and poor quality  food resulting in a high prevalence of malnutrition. Indeed under-nutrition and growth faltering has been  identified as an underlying cause of around 50% of the deaths associated with infectious diseases in children  in this region. In our previous work we found a strong association between aflatoxin biomarker levels and  growth faltering in West African children; in addition, there was evidence of altered immunity in individuals  with high biomarker levels. Dietary exposure to this mycotoxin may therefore make a significant contribution  to childhood morbidity and mortality. The first goal of this project is to characterize the contribution of  mycotoxin exposure early in life (pre- and post-natal) to growth faltering and health outcomes.

7K08NS065116-05,National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke,96,"PROJECT SUMMARY:  Toxoplasma gondii is an intracellular parasite that has a particular tropism for the central nervous system (CNS) where it establishes a latent, encysted infection. This parasite can cause severe neurologic consequences and death in congenital infections or when reactivated in immunocompromised patients. Although the CNS has long been known to be the primary organ that harbors the encysted form of Toxoplasma, the CNS- parasite interaction is poorly understood. I have developed a proposal that will help me gain the scientific tools I need to become an independent, academic neurologist who studies the molecular mechanisms underlying this CNS infection.  The goal of the research plan is to use the mouse model of toxoplasmosis in combination with site- specific recombination to understand how the cells of the CNS and different strains of Toxoplasma have specifically co-evolved to produce a variable immune response that results in a chronic CNS infection with or without concomintant encephalitis. Preliminary work I have done shows that by equipping Toxoplasma with a secretable Cre recombinase fusion protein, site-specific recombination will occur only in infected host cells. Specific aim 1 is to transfer this technology into more biologically relevant, cyst-forming Toxoplasma strains. The goal of specific aim 2 is to verify the intracellular nature of the latent cyst in the CNS and establish the lineage of the cyst- containing host cells. I will accomplish this goal by using immunohistochemistry and fluorescent confocal microscopy to evaluate brain sections of Cre-reporter mice chronically infected with Toxoplasma-Cre strains. Specific aim 3 then employs laser- capture microdissection to isolate the infected host cells determined in aim 2 in order to genetically profile these host cells on mouse genome expression arrays and ultimately determine how host cell modifications impact disease outcome.  Understanding the molecular mechanisms that culminate in a chronic infection of the CNS will guide the development of drugs needed to actually cure toxoplasmosis, as well as identify novel gene targets for modulating the immune response in autoimmune diseases of the CNS.

This risk is accentuated by the fact that the category ABC priority pathogens are rarely encountered in the US in clinical settings, and as a result the level of preparedness to respond to such threats remains alarmingly low. Therefore, we are proposing to identify molecular biomarker signatures for category B pathogens by creating a consortium with investigators working in areas of the world where they are causing substantial morbidity and mortality. We will pursue an alternative and potentially complementary approach to direct pathogen detection by developing diagnostic markers based on the assessment of the host transcriptional response to infection. Indeed, we have already demonstrated that dramatic changes in blood gene expression profiles occur during the acute phase of an infection, and that those changes are pathogen-specific. In the context of this project: (1) we will collect blood samples from well characterized patients with sepsis (Burkholderia pseudomallei / Khon Kaen University, Thailand), persistent fever (Brucella sp. / Centre d'lmmunologie de Marseille Luminy, France) and diarrheal diseases (Escherichia coli, pathogenic Vibrio strains, Shigella spp, Salmonella, Campylobacter jejuni and Caliciviruses / Department of Molecular Biomedicine, CINVESTAV& Microbiology Research Laboratory at Hospital General O'Horan of Merida, Mexico); (2) we will identify candidate diagnostic signatures and indicators of disease severity for infectious diseases caused by category B priority pathogens using a genome-wide blood transcriptional screen (48,000 transcripts); and (3) we will validate candidate blood markers using a focused transcriptional assay. In summary, this program will support a productive network of investigators, including research clinicians, research scientists with expertise in the immunology and genomics fields, as well as an experience support team of bioinformaticians and biostatisticians who will work together towards the development of novel tools that will improve the management of patients with infections caused by category B priority pathogens.",Blood Transcriptional Biomarker Profiles For Category B Pathogens,2009,2014,"Chaussabel, Damien ",Benaroya Research Inst At Virginia Mason,Seattle,WA,56,1,-1,-1

Identification of new molecular targets for drug development is key for future therapy as resistance to the main class of drugs, imidazoles, has been detected in both parasites. This proposal brings together the expertise and interdisciplinary efforts of four major laboratories to build on basic research on parasite pathogenesis for a focus on drug development. We have shown that cysteine proteinases are critical for invasion of E. histolytica and excystation of G. lamblia. Cathepsins are an attractive drug target as they have been well characterized biochemically and structurally and are the focus of large inhibitor libraries. EhCP1, one of two cysteine proteinases unique to E. histolytica, is undergoing crystallization studies under Dr. Van Voorhis. The enzyme's unique requirement for arginine in the P2 position, led to the synthesis of a lead small molecule inhibitor by Dr. Roush's group with an IC50 for EhCP1 of <25 nM and >10-fold specificity for the amebic enzyme vs. human cathepsin B. We will test the proof of priniciple that we can develop an inhibitor that is sensitive, nontoxic, and specific for the protozoal cathepsins. Dr. Roush's group will synthesize additional compounds with improved potency and specificity for the parasitic enzymes based on SAR data we have generated. The lead compounds will then undergo basic toxicity testing and efficacy in standard models for in vitro and in vivo amebic infection. We will leverage the findings of the initial crystallization studies of EhCP1 to a structural based drug discovery to guide medicinal chemistry. The active, recombinant enzyme of the next drug target, GICP2, has been expressed by Dr. McKerrow's group and the effect of inhibitors on excystation will be validated with Dr. Gillin. We will also identify other potential classes of inhibitors by high throughput screening of Dr. McKerrow's focused 4000 compound library. These studies will provide the basis to identify novel cathepsin inhibitors against amebic and giardial cathepsins with the potential to target other protozoal enzymes in the future. Relevance.

5R01AI054483-10,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"This is an A1 (year -06 149=13.5%) competing renewal for grant R01 AI054883 entitled Immunity and Pathogenesis of a Novel Norovirus. Noroviruses (NoV, Category B Biodefense agents) are the major etiologic agent of nonbacterial, epidemic gastroenteritis worldwide, causing significant suffering, morbidity, and economic loss. Eighty to 96% of all cases of non-bacterial epidemic gastroenteritis in the US are attributed to NoV. Human NoV are not readily cultured and do not infect small animals. There is no NoV vaccine, although significant insight has come from studies of the immune response to virus-like-particles generated when NoV capsid proteins are over expressed. We identified murine NoV (MNV) in 20031, and during the first grant period made significant strides towards developing MNV infection into a robust infection-only experimental model for understanding aspects of NoV replication, immunity, and pathogenesis. We developed the first NoV culture system in 20042, and the first NoV reverse genetics system coupled to a culture system in 20073. MNV was found to infect a significant proportion of laboratory mice, requiring a significant investment in developing a closed mouse breeding colony to generate non-immune mice with which to perform immunology and pathogenesis experiments. Further work has led to isolation and full sequencing of 21 new strains, and the solution of the cryo-EM structure of both the T=3 virion and a fascinating smaller T=1 particle assembled from the MNV capsid protein. Of fundamental importance, we show here that it is possible to effectively vaccinate against MNV, and that clearance of MNV from intestine involves B cells, antibody, CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, and perforin. Interestingly, certain MNV strains persistently replicate in intestine of WT mice and are shed in feces for weeks despite a significant immune response. The combination of reverse genetics, a vaccination model, mouse genetics, and persistent and non-persistent MNV strains will allow us to define molecular and immunologic mechanisms of MNV immunity through the following Specific Aims: Aim 1. Determine the mechanism(s) responsible for vaccination against MNV. Aim 2. Determine the mechanism(s) responsible for persistent shedding of MNV in feces. Aim 3. Test the hypothesis that production of the T=1 form of MNV is an immune evasion strategy. 1. Karst, et al. STAT1-dependent innate immunity to a Norwalk-like virus. 2003. Science. 299:1575. 2.

In addition we have set up molecular methods that will allow us to map viral genes responsible for important biological phenotypes. In this grant we propose to define the mechanisms responsible for norovirus immunity and vaccination, determine the mechanisms that allow the virus to persist despite an active immune response, and define the role in infection of a novel viral particle made in norovirus infected cells that we hypothesize may be a viral tool to evade immunity.",IMMUNITY AND PATHOGENESIS OF A NOVEL NOROVIRUS,2003,2014,"Virgin, Herbert W",Washington University,Saint Louis,MO,30,1,2,-1
5R03AI092170-02,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"The protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii is an important opportunistic parasite causing life threatening infections in the immune compromised and severe birth defects when acquired in utero. The parasite grows within a specialized compartment, the parasitophorous vacuole (PV) within the infected host cell. The boundary defining this niche is the PV membrane (PVM) that serves as the interface between the parasite and host. Despite its importance, investigation of the PVM has been limited. We have recently completed a proteomic analysis of the T. gondii PVM resulting in the identification of 123 proteins of which 70 appear to be novel. Of these novel proteins, 26 are annotated as hypothetical ORF's precluding any assignment of function. As hypothetical ORF's, these loci lack any identifiable motif indicating they are truly novel. While several appear unique to Toxoplasma, others have similarly annotated homologs in other less tractable Apicomplexa including Plasmodium and Cryptosporidium spp. suggesting conserved function. As novel proteins that are potentially localized to the PVM, an organelle found only in the context of parasite infection, these hypothetical ORF's represent potentially unique activities that may serve as drug targets. In this study we exploit recently developed technologies to epitope tag and localize the hypothetical ORF's as a prelude to cloning the validated genes and attempting the gene knockouts. Together these studies represent a secondary analysis of an existing data set as a limited short term project with a high potential of revealing novel activities. As such it is ideally suited to the RO3 funding mechanism. With this proposal we aim to perform the initial characterization of these orphan genes toward establishing their functions in parasite biology.

5R01HD061916-04,National Institute of Child Health and Human Development,23,"Enteric infections remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children under the age of five. Pathogens affecting this age group commonly use lectin-like adhesins to adhere to host glycoproteins and glycolipids expressed on small intestinal enterocytes and/or M cells. The expression patterns of these glycoconjugates can thus impact the host's underlying susceptibility to infection. A variety of factors including age, hormones, diet, and colonization with specific commensal microflora impacts epithelial glycoconjugate expression. We have shown that colonization of adult germ-free (gnotobiotic) with the commensal Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron induces a mature pattern by up-regulating enterocyte-specific expression of a 1,2 fucosyltransferase. Fucosyltransferases link fucose to terminal galactose and N-acetyl-glucosamine residues, and thereby mask potential ligands on epithelial surfaces. These data suggest that colonization with select commensals could be used to therapeutically stimulate beneficial changes in epithelial glycoconjugate expression in susceptible populations. This proposal will test the hypothesis that select microflora, notably B. thetaiotaomicron, stimulate the development of glycoconjugates on the apical surfaces of enterocytes and M cells that reduces the capacity of pathogenic bacteria, viruses and/or toxins to infect/intoxicate the intestinal epithelium. Aims 1 and 2 will determine the full impact of B. thetaiotaomicron on expression and accessibility of epithelial glycoconjugates in the small and large intestines.

1P01AI097113-01,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Project Summary/Abstract  Critical issues emerging from current attempts at inducing transplantation tolerance in the clinic include the need for biomarkers that predict and diagnose tolerance as well as for the identification of barriers to tolerance induction and maintenance. Our preliminary observations have led us to the realization that the durability of the tolerant state is variable and can be unpredictably breached by Listeria infections. The overall goal of the proposed studies Is to determine a mechanistic basis for how Infections can either erode or transiently abrogate robust tolerance after It has been stably established. We propose 3 specific aims:  Specific Aim 1: Our investigations to date have determined that the abrogation of established tolerance by Listeria infection is mechanistically different from the prevention of tolerance induction, and that the combination of IL-6 and IFNU is necessary and sufficient to abrogate established tolerance. We will conduct mechanistic studies to determine how the combination of IL-6 and IFNB abrogates established tolerance.  Specific Aim 2: Approximately 25% of tolerant recipients infected with Listeria do not reject their grafts.  However, this retained state of tolerance acquires susceptibility to reversal by PDL-1 blockade, whereas tolerance prior to Listeria infection does not. We will determine the mechanistic bases for these observations, and test whether other infections such as Staphylococcus aureus and influenza, that cannot precipitate rejection in recipients with established tolerance, can nonetheless erode the quality of tolerance and make it increasingly susceptible to reversal.  Specific Aim 3: Our investigations have recently revealed an unexpected resilience of the state of transplantation tolerance. Infection with Listeria only transiently subsumes the tolerant state but tolerance spontaneously returns after the infection is cleared. We will define why and how tolerance is spontaneously restored when infection with Listeria is cleared.  We anticipate that these studies will provide novel and clinically relevant insights into how tolerance to allografts is maintained, abrogated and potentially restorable. Our studies may also lead to the identification of biomarkers for the diagnosis and assessment of the quality of tolerance, and to the definition of therapies that can maintain and boost the quality of tolerance. Finally, we speculate that studies on how tolerance is transiently lost but spontaneously re-established might reveal fundamental principles of how T cell responses are regulated not only in transplantation tolerance but also in autoimmunity and in the recurrence of cancers.",Impact Of Infections On The Stability Of Established Tolerance,,,"Chong, Anita S.",University of Chicago,Chicago,IL,17,1,377,5085

1R42NS079060-01,National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke,96,"Human prion diseases are infectious and invariably fatal forms of neurodegenerative diseases, including sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD), the most common form, and variant CJD (vCJD) which is associated to consumption of cattle meat infected by bovine spongiform encephalopathy. Currently there is not sensitive, objective and non-invasive biochemical diagnosis for these diseases, and even less a procedure to detect people incubating the disease in the pre-symptomatic period. This is a major problem for public health, because prion diseases are known to transmit iatrogenically between human-to-human and because due to the long pre-symptomatic stage of the disease-which may span five decades-the asymptomatic carriers far outnumber the clinically affected individuals. To make the situation even more complicated, the infectious agent responsible for these diseases, termed prion, is composed exclusively of a conformationally altered form of a naturally occurring protein, named PrPSc, which has the unique ability to infect individuals and propagate in the body without the need for genetic material. PrPSc is not only the infectious agent and the likely culprit of neurodegeneration, but also the best surrogate marker for the disease. The challenge is that its quantity is high only in the brain at late stages of the disease However, compelling evidences indicate that PrPSc is present in minute amounts in various peripheral tissues and biological fluids. The main goal of this proposal is to develop a blood- and  cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-based detection assay for PrPSc associated with sCJD and vCJD. Our strategy utilizes two pioneering proprietary technologies developed in our lab: First the protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) technique which enables to amplify the amount of PrPSc present in the sample to detect as little as a single molecule of PrPSc. PMCA, has a similar power of amplification as PCR and allowed us to detect, for the first time, prions in blood  and urine, even at the pre-symptomatic stages of the disease. Second, PrPSc-specific monoclonal antibodies (called PrioC) raised against prion-infected brain homogenates in PrP knock out mice. In this project we will optimize a technology combining PMCA amplification of PrPSc with detection by sandwich ELISA using the PrioC conformational antibodies. The assay will be optimized using animal and human samples for high throughput detection of prions in biological fluids, and will be validated for sensitivity and specificity according to the requiremets of the regulatory authorities with the aim to obtain approval for commercialization. The results generated in this project may lead to the first biochemical test validated for the diagnosis of CJD. With this validated technology, Amprion will establish an International Reference Laboratory for the Detection and Eradication of human prion diseases.

5R01ES020921-02,National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences,25,"Project Summary/Abstract Human exposure to sediment-borne contaminants is not directly related to chemical concentrations in the bulk sediment, but is instead controlled by the bioavailable concentration or bioavailability. Remediation practices, such as dredging, sand capping, sorbent amendment, and even monitored natural recovery (MNR) may all affect the bioavailability of sediment contaminants differently than the bulk sediment chemical concentration. In particular, bioavailability is a key to better assessing human exposure to hydrophobic organic contaminants (HOCs) such as DDT, PCBs, PAHs and dioxins through consumption of fish from contaminated areas. However, current methods for determining sediment HOC bioavailability suffer from method-specific limitations. Partial extraction techniques to estimate bioaccessibility are invariably influenced by types of extractants and extraction conditions selected. Passive samplers, including solid phase microextraction (SPME), must be used under equilibrium conditions that may take months to reach. In this project we exploit the wide availability of stable isotope labeled HOC compounds and GC-MS systems in two novel applications aiming to greatly improve the efficiency and accuracy of bioavailability measurement. The first approach uses the concept of isotope exchange (or dilution), similar to what has been done for trace elements, to derive the exchangeable concentration as an approximation of bioaccessible concentration. The fact that most HOCs are highly stable lends them the quality of being conservative and thus ideal for such an application. In the second approach, we incorporate stable isotope labeled HOCs with SPME by using the labeled HOCs as performance reference compounds so that SPME may be used under non-equilibrium conditions with short sampling time. The isotope exchange approach may be applied to ex situ assessment while the stable isotope- SPME method may be used for both ex situ and in situ measurements. We will carry out systematic studies to prove the underlying assumptions, develop and optimize the methods using spiked sediments, validate the methods through extensive bioaccumulation assays using a common fish prey (polychaete worm) and a deposit-feeding fish (California halibut), and then apply the methods for ex situ and in situ measurement of bioavailability of DDTs and PCBs at the Palos Verdes Shelf Superfund site off the coast of Los Angeles that has undergone pilot remediation trials and is scheduled for sand capping in 2012. At the end of this project, we expect to produce a range of rigorously tested methods that may be easily adopted for ex situ or in situ monitoring of sediment remediation sites to evaluate the effectiveness of remediation operations and predict changes in human exposure potential.",Development Of Stable Isotope Based Methods To Predict Bioavailability Of Hydroph,2011,2014,"Gan, Jay ",University of California Riverside,Riverside,CA,6,1,-1,4439
5R01DK092441-02,National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,24,"Despite major medical advances, diarrheal diseases still cause ~2.6 million deaths per year worldwide. Therefore, a better understanding of the pathophysiology of diarrheal diseases is critical for designing novel and superior strategies for interventions. Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), a food-borne pathogen, is a major cause of infantile diarrhea worldwide causing high rate of morbidity and mortality. To date, however, the mechanisms underlying EPEC-induced diarrhea are not well understood. Diarrhea occurs either via increased intestinal secretion or decreased absorption, or both. In this regard, electroneutral NaCl absorption is the predominant route for Na+ and Cl- absorption in the human ileum and colon. Intestinal luminal membrane NHE3 (sodium hydrogen exchanger 3) and DRA [Down Regulated in Adenoma, SLC26A3 Cl-/HCO3-(OH-) exchanger] proteins play critical roles in electroneutral NaCl absorption in the human intestine. Earlier published and preliminary studies from our group demonstrated that the early events following EPEC-induced diarrhea involved inhibition of NHE3 and DRA activity due to their internalization from surface of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) via distinct mechanisms. NHE3 inhibition required E. coli secreted protein EspF and host IEC PDZ-protein NHERF2, whereas internalization of DRA required EPEC secreted EspGs (G1/G2) and disruption of IEC microtubular network. Based on these data, we hypothesize that acute EPEC infection inhibits intestinal NaCl absorption via cellular internalization of cell surface NHE3 and DRA. This internalization requires complex interactions between EPEC-secreted proteins and host IEC lipid-rafts, cytoskeletal (ezrin, actin) and PDZ domain proteins (NHERFs). Therefore, the objective of our current studies is to explore in detail the trafficking mechanisms underlying EPEC-induced internalization of NHE3 and DRA in intestinal epithelial cells utilizing state-of-the art in vitro and in vivo approaches. Specific Aim 1 has been designed to yield critical mechanistic information on contribution of lipid rafts, cytoskeletal and NHERF proteins in EPEC and EspF- induced inhibition of NHE3 activity. Specific Aim 2 will investigate mechanisms underlying DRA trafficking in vitro, including the role of lipid rafts, microtubules and NHERF proteins in response to EPEC or EspGs. Specific Aim 3 will utilize in vivo mouse models to validate in vitro data by examining the effects of EPEC infection on NHE3 and DRA and net impact on coupled NaCl and water absorption utilizing state-of-the-art techniques, NHERF knockout mice and mice administered colchicine. Our proposed studies should provide new insights into the pathophysiology of EPEC-induced diarrhea and mechanisms underlying regulation of NaCl absorption in the mammalian intestine and are, therefore, of great physiological and clinical significance. It is likely that these studies may identify novel molecular targets involved in EPEC-IEC interactions culminating in impaired NaCl absorption and may aid in the future development of better management strategies for the treatment of infectious diarrhea.",Transporter Trafficking Mechanisms In Infectious Diarrhea,2011,2015,"Dudeja, Pradeep K",University of Illinois At Chicago,Chicago,IL,17,1,-1,5317
2R01AI068741-06A1,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Staphylococcus aureus is a ubiquitous Gram-positive organism implicated in a spectrum of diseases; from benign, localized skin infections to life-threatening, systemic illnesses including pneumonia, sepsis and menstrual or non-menstrual toxic shock syndromes (TSS). The virulence and pathogenicity of S. aureus is attributed to its several exotoxins. The superantigen exotoxins (SAg) are important amongst them because SAg are the most potent activators of T lymphocytes known. Certain SAg could also be used as biological weapons. Thus, SAg are important from many perspectives. Nonetheless, the molecular pathways by which SAg participate in the disease pathogenesis have not been completely understood due to lack of good animal models. The conventional mouse strains are resistant to TSS due to poor binding of SAg to mouse MHC class II. However, SAg binds more efficiently to human MHC (called HLA) class I molecules. Therefore, mice transgenically expressing HLA class II molecules readily succumb to the pathogenic effects of SAg delivered through different routes and to S. aureus infection. As the disease caused by SAg in HLA class II (HLA-DR3) transgenic mice also closely mimics the syndrome in humans, they are ideal models. Using this mouse model we have demonstrated that interferon-gamma (IFN-?) dependent small intestinal pathology plays a critical role in lethality associated with TSS. However, the molecular pathways by which INF-&#191; contributes to lethality in TSS, either directly or indirectly through other mediators, are not clear. Therefore, it is proposed to (1) Delineate th mechanisms by which IFN-&#191; plays a lethal role in staphylococcal SAg-induced TSS. This will be achieved by generating bone marrow chimeras between HLA-DR3.IFN-?R+/+ and HLA-DR3.IFN-?R-/- mice. Bone marrow chimeras will be challenged with SEB and several molecular pathways will be compared. However, IFN-? is also important for immunity S. aureus infections. Therefore, it is proposed to (2) Determine the role of IFN-? in the pathogenesis and immunity to MRSA-induced pneumonia and sepsis. This wil be accomplished by inducing pneumonia and sepsis in HLA-DR3.IFN-?+/+ and HLA-DR3.IFN-?R-/- mice with the MRSA isolate, USA300. Several bacteriological, immunological, biochemical and pathological parameters including mortality will be compared between these two lines of mice. It is known that HLA class II polymorphisms could strongly influence the magnitude of T cell activation and IFN-? production in response to streptococcal SAg. However, the impact of HLA-DR and HLA-DQ polymorphisms on staphylococcal SAg-driven immuneresponses has not been investigated. Therefore, it is proposed to (3) Determine the extent to which staphylococcal superantigen-induced IFN-? production is modulated by HLA class II polymorphisms thereby influencing the outcome of MRSA-induced pneumonia and sepsis. This will be investigated by a series of in vivo studies using transgenic mice expressing HLA-DR2, HLA-DR3, HLA-DR4, HLA-DQ2, HLA-DQ6 or HLA-DQ8 molecules.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Staphylococcus aureus is a common, yet potentially dangerous bacterium. The occurrence of serious infections caused by the antibiotic resistant strains is increasing worldwide, which could be partly attributed to the ability of these strains t produce several harmful toxins. This study investigates the mechanisms of action of one such family of toxins called superantigens. Also, the reasons as to why and how certain individuals might have different outcomes following an S. aureus infection will be studied using our humanized mice.",HLA Class II Transgenic Mouse Models For S.

5R01AI074856-05,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"The objective of the proposed studies is to understand the protein-protein interactions involved in the assembly of the bacterial type III secretion needle apparatus. This apparatus resembles a syringe on the bacterial surface and is used by many pathogens to inject virulence factors into target cells to initiate human diseases. The needle-like assembly consists of about 120 copies of identical proteins that are arranged in a superhelical manner, and the apex of this needle is capped by tip proteins. Over the past two years, we have completed the NMR structures of two needle monomers: BsaL from Burkholderia pseudomallei, a pathogen associated with biowarfare, and PrgI from Salmonella typhimurium, a pathogen associated with food poisoning. We have also used NMR to identify the key residues involved in the binding interaction between the needle and tip proteins of Shigella flexneri. Our goal is to elucidate how the needle apparatus is assembled by determining the precise protein-protein contacts involving the needle and tip proteins. We will combine NMR with electron microscopy and molecular modeling to determine the structure of the assembled needle. Our aims are: (#1) determine how the needle is assembled, (#2) determine how the tip protein docks on the needle, and (#3) use mutagenesis and microbiological assays to correlate the structural results to needle assembly and virulence in vivo. Many pathogens rely on the needle apparatus to infect millions of people worldwide and many are potential agents of bioterrorism. Because this apparatus is exposed on the bacterial surface, disrupting the needle assembly is an attractive approach for the development of novel anti-infectives. This approach requires a detailed understanding of the protein-protein interactions involved in needle assembly. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The appearance of many antibiotic resistant bacterial pathogens poses a major problem in public health and safety and many of these bacteria rely on a needle-like protein assembly to infect their hosts. The proposed research seeks to elucidate how this needle is assembled by determining the protein-protein interactions of its components.

5F30HL096352-04,"National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute",98,"T cell receptors recognize peptide antigens bound to and presented by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in a highly specific manner. A unique class of ligands called superantigens (SAgs), which are a type of toxin secreted by bacteria, bind to the T cell receptor in a different manner than normal antigens. When a foreign antigen enters the immune system, T cell receptors are activated and the normal response activates a small percentage of the immune system, less than 0.01 percent. In comparison, these toxins can activate up to 30 percent of the immune system. This overstimulation of the immune system leads to a massive release of cytokines such as TNF-a and IL-2, thereby causing severe inflammatory reactions. Though these toxins have been identified as the cause of Toxic Shock Syndrome and linked to other diseases, in recent years these toxins have increasingly been implicated in several pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases. Necrotizing pneumonia is among these diseases, which can involve airway inflammation, permanent airway destruction, and mortality. Most importantly for the present application, studies have shown that these exotoxins contribute directly to severe lung infection caused by Community- Associated Methicillin-Resistant S. Aureus (CA-MRSA). The increase in prevalence of MRSA, both in hospitals and the community, emphasizes the immediate need to target the toxins secreted by this bacterium. Therefore, in this application, T-cells will be engineered against these exotoxins. The exotoxins that will be focused on include Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB), Staphylococcal enterotoxin C3 (SEC3), and toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (TSST-1). The approach is to use a novel method of directed evolution to engineer T cell receptors that bind with high affinity to these clinically important toxins. Soluble forms of high affinity T cell receptors can neutralize the systemic toxicity of the SAgs, as has been recently shown in animal models with the toxin SEB. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The long-term goal of this application is to engineer soluble T cell receptors to treat exotoxin-induced pulmonary disease. To accomplish this goal, the first specific aim is to design, engineer, and express T cell receptors that bind with high-affinity to the SAg exotoxins SEC3 and TSST-1.

5R01DK032346-28,National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,24,"Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are clinically, immunologically and morphologically distinct forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The classic inflammatory response in ulcerative colitis patients is limited to the mucosa and submucosa. Yet, the colonic circular smooth muscle contractility is suppressed in these patients. The precise nature of the stimulus and the cellular mechanisms that suppress circular smooth muscle contractility in the absence of a clearly identified inflammatory response in the muscularis externa are not known. By contrast, transmural inflammation occurs in Crohn's disease. The circular smooth muscle contractility is suppressed also in these patients. Our overarching hypothesis is that different inflammatory mediators and cellular mechanisms suppress colonic circular smooth muscle contractility in the two forms of IBD. We will test this hypothesis in two well-established and validated animal models of inflammation, the trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) - induced colonic inflammation that mimics the classic features of Crohn's disease, and dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) - induced colonic inflammation that mimics those of ulcerative colitis. Our specific aims are to investigate the: 1. Differential immune responses in the muscularis externa of the TNBS and DSS models and how the initial immune response in the mucosa sends the signal to the muscularis externa to initiate the immune response there.2. Cellular and molecular mechanisms by which the respective prominent inflammatory mediators in the muscularis externa of the TNBS and DSS models alter the expression of key cell signaling proteins in circular smooth muscle cells, which suppresses their contractility.3. Cis-regulation of genes encoding the proteins, whose suppression results in the reduction of cell contractility in the TNBS and DSS models of inflammation. The hypothesis, that motility dysfunction due to the suppression of circular smooth muscle contractility may result from different cellular and molecular mechanisms, is novel. Gut inflammation may occur due to a variety of bacterial, viral and parasitic infections as well as due to food allergies, and IBD. Colonic motility dysfunction is one of the major factors contributing to the common symptom of diarrhea in all types of inflammation. Our findings are expected to suggest that alternate therapeutic approaches may be required to normalize motility dysfunction in different types of inflammation. This situation is similar to that in the two forms of IBD; both of which develop inflammation, but their therapeutic approaches are different, because the nature of inflammatory responses in the ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease patients are different.

Tight junctions (TJs) regulate water and ion movement in the intestine and protect the sterile compartments beneath the single layer of epithelial cells from luminal contents. EPEC alter dramatically TJ structure and function by injecting effector molecules into intestinal epithelial cells via a type III secreton system (T3SS). The long-term goal of this proposal is to gain a better understanding of how multiple EPEC effectors coordinate to disrupt TJs. The independent and coordinated activities of four T3SS effector proteins (EspF, Map, EspG, NleA) will be studied. TJs remodel constantly to maintain homeostasis and undergo restoration. Preliminary data support that EPEC effectors interfere with homeostatic and restorative processes including cell polarity, TJ protein recycling, and trafficking of newly synthesized proteins. The objective, in pursuit of this goal, is to define how specific EPEC effectors cooperate to alter host cell processes that stabilize intact TJs and block those that restore disrupted TJs. The central hypothesis is that EPEC perturbation of TJs is a 2-hit process involving dismantling of intact TJ by EspF and Map, and hindrance of TJ restoration by EspG and NleA by interfering with TJ protein recycling and the transport of newly synthesized TJ proteins. In vitro and in vivo models will be used to study infection with wildtype EPEC as well as key mutant strains. State-of- the-art microscopic techniques will be coupled with molecular, cellular, microbiological, protein biochemistry, and physiological approaches to achieve the stated goals. Definition of the events by which bacterial pathogens perturb TJs and of the processes involved in TJ maintenance and restoration will guide the development of strategies aimed at preserving and restoring these important structures under adverse circumstances. The central hypothesis will be tested by addressing the following Specific Aims: 1. Define the mechanisms underlying disruption of intact TJs by EPEC and investigate the cooperative relationship between specific effectors. Aim 1 will define how EspF and Map coordinate to impact cell polarity and TJs in order to identify a single clear target for novel therapeutic interventions. 2. Determine the effect of EPEC on TJ restoration and identify the effectors and mechanisms responsible. Aim 2 will address the effect of EspG-induced microtubule disruption on TJ protein recycling and restoration as well as inhibition of ER-Golgi trafficking by NleA on restoration of TJs dismantled by other effectors, such as EspF and Map. 3. Resolve the mechanisms of TJ disruption by EPEC in an in vivo model. Aim 3 will validate the findings of Aims 1 and 2 in an in vivo model using state-of-the-art techniques.

A significant but much less well-documented sequelae of invasive Lm infections involve the heart; this type of infection is estimated to occur in at least % to 10% of those with invasive disease. Recently published data indicates that significant subpopulations of Lm strains have the capacity to target and invade cardiac cells; this is a new finding with important clinical implications. Experiments outlined within this proposal will test te hypothesize that cardioinvasive Lm strains have developed novel mechanisms and/or express novel or altered bacterial factors that enable them to replicate within cardiac tissues. These studies will provide a detailed understanding of the pathogenesis and maturation of myocarditis resulting from Lm infection, and will clarify bacterial factors that contribute to specific host tisue tropisms. Aim 1 will decipher the pathology of Lm cardioinvasive strains in animal infection models. Bacterial infections will be monitored in mice using in vivo bioluminescence imagining to determine the progression of cardiac infection as well as the potential for bacterial colonization at other body sites. Experiments will also include the histological examination of target tissues to characterize sites of host immune cell infiltration as well as the use of immuno-spin capture technology to definitively identify cellular damage that occurs as a result of the hos inflammatory response to Lm infection. Aim 2 will focus on the functional characterization of bacterial factors associated with invasive cardiac infections. Genetic and cellular approaches will be used to identify Lm factors that enhance cardiac invasion relative to the invasion of other  cell types. The ultimate goal of these studies will be to establish and functionally characterize a  cardiac model of infection for Lm and to determine the bacterial factors that contribute to the enhanced ability of selected Lm strains to invade and destroy cardiac tissue. This information will be useful for the early identification of Lm outbreak strains that pose increased risk for patient heart infections. Finally, the experiments outlined in this proposal will provide important  insight into the mechanisms that establish bacterial tropism for specific host tissues and in addition will identify in vivo cellular targets of oxidative damage resulting from host inflammator responses to infection.

SEB causes polyclonal activation of T lymphocytes resulting in massive release of pro-inflammatory mediators and culminating in severe toxic shock. SEB is considered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as a category B select agent. SEB is also a major cause of food poisoning and toxic shock syndrome. Currently, there are no therapeutics available against SEB for human use. This proposal is aimed at preclinical development of fully human therapeutic anti-SEB monoclonal antibodies (hMabs). By using a human combinatorial antibody library and a phage display approach, a cohort of fully human antibodies against SEB were identified. Preliminary characterization has led to the selection of eight clones for pre-clinical testing and evaluation. Several of these hMabs displayed neutralizing activity towards SEB. The research plan is designed in 4 Specific Aims. In Aim 1, lead hMabs with neutralizing activity against SEB intoxication and other related superantigens will be identified based upon extensive studies using in vitro proliferation assays and an in vivo mouse model of SEB intoxication. Therapeutic efficacy of the lead hMabs will be determined within Aim 2 in a mouse model of SEB-induced toxic shock to identify a short list of lead therapeutics. In Aim 3, the lead therapeutic antibodies will be subjected to affinity maturation, if necessary, by using a proprietary mutagenesis technology that will result in a second generation of optimized anti-SEB hMabs. Therapeutic candidates will be biophysically characterized. The optimized hMabs will be tested within Aim 4 via a humanized transgenic mouse model and rhesus aerosol challenge model for toxic shock to identify the final preclinical therapeutic candidate against SEB intoxication.

We have made the  observation that the mRNA and protein for desmoglein (Dsg) 1, a major protein involved in forming epithelial  junctions through desmosomes, is markedly downregulated in EE, and its expression remains decreased  even following treatment-induced disease remission. Furthermore, we have preliminary evidence linking EE  susceptibility with SNPs within the Dsg1 gene. It is remarkable that mutations of Dsg genes and  autoanfibodies against Dsg proteins have been associated with squamous epithelium disorders that  sometimes include esophageal pathology and features commonly seen in EE (e.g. epithelial erosion, dilated  intracellular spaces (DIS), and eosinophilic infiltrates). Taken together, we propose the central hypothesis  that Dsg1 is specifically involved in EE disease pathogenesis and susceptibility. We are well positioned to  answer key questions concerning EE based on a multi-faceted approach including: (1) an extensive  databank of samples from well-characterized EE and control patients; (2) newly developed systems for  culturing and manipulating esophageal epithelial cells in vitro and ex vivo; and (3) our ability to validate Dsg1  genetic linkage using replication cohorts of EE patients and parent offspring trios, as well as our ability to  test genotype/phenotype relationships using our EE sample databank.

The overall goal of this competing renewal R01 grant application (5 R01 AR41256-18) will be to determine how colonization with toxin producing S. aureus in AD patients alters inflammatory response in the skin. As well, we wish to investigate novel mechanisms by which Th2 environment in combination with toxin production by S. aureus enhance skin inflammation. Our previous studies of staphylococcal superantigens primarily focused on mononuclear cell activation by these toxins in the skin. New preliminary data show that staphylococcal superantigens (staphylococcal enterotoxin B, SEB) also exert effects directly on keratinocytes and contribute to the skin inflammation by inducing proinflammatory and Th2 cell skin homing chemokines. Global gene expression profiling of SEB stimulated human keratinocytes demonstrates protease activation by SEB and suggests that SEB may enhance allergic skin sensitization due to changes in extracellular matrix that can affect allergen absorption and inflammation, which we will explore in this proposal. We present evidence for Th2 cytokine potentiation of keratinocyte responses to SEB and propose that this occurs either through synergism with SEB induced pathways and/or increased expression of a specific receptor to SEB, therefore amplifying inflammatory responses in atopic skin. Finally, we demonstrate that staphylococcal pore forming alpha-toxin, that often coincides with superantigen production by S. aureus, can potentiate responses to staphylococcal products by facilitating their intracellular entry via toxin-induced pores, thereby allowing the engagement of intracellular receptors. Th2 cytokines may increase alpha-toxin binding to keratinocytes, affecting pore formation and intensifying keratinocyte responses to staphylococcal products.  The specific aims of this proposal will be: first, to determine the effects of staphylococcal superantigens on inflammatory responses of keratinocytes, focusing on gene and protein expression profiling in superantigen activated human keratinocytes and skin samples from AD patients colonized with superantigen producing S. aureus, in vivo inflammatory responses and allergen absorption in murine skin following epicutaneous application of SEB; second, to explore the modulatory role of Th2 cytokines in responses to staphylococcal superantigens in the skin by analyzing changes in gene and protein expression in keratinocytes, assessing inflammatory responses to SEB in STAT6 transgenic mice, exploring signaling pathways engaged by SEB and Th2 cytokines, and defining the specific SEB receptor; finally, to investigate the immunomodulatory role of staphylococcal alpha-toxin in keratinocyte responses to SEB/other staphylococcal products.

Our methodology has coupled precise, targeted mutagenesis and heterologous expression of candidate virulence factor genes with in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo models of disease pathogenesis, including WT, knockout and human transgenic mouse lines. We hypothesize that the outcome of GAS infection is dictated by the action and regulation of these GAS virulence factors in response to selective pressures exerted by host innate immunity. In this proposal, we will define the repertoire of bacterial virulence factors that promote the shift of GAS M1T1 strains to an invasive disease phenotype in response to innate immune selection. In Aim 1, we will test a unique and extensive panel of isogenic M1T1 GAS virulence factor mutants for neutrophil resistance, invasive phenotype switching, and systemic infection in the humanized plasminogen mouse, defining those innate immune resistance factors necessary for systemic virulence. In parallel, we will constitutively express specific virulence factors to identify if any are sufficient to promote disease progression. In the complementary studies of Aim 2, we will use pharmacologic techniques and knockout mice to define those specific aspects of host innate immune defense that exert selective pressure on GAS M1T1 favoring the shift to invasive phenotype. In Aim 3, we will determine the contribution of specific M1T1 GAS virulence genes and invasive phenotype shifting on GAS fitness during epithelial cell interactions and mucosal colonization. In this fashion, we will identify the competing selective pressures faced by this obligate human pathogen during the different stages of its overall ecology. Finally, we will assess the robustness of our experimental model (Nat Med 2007) that acquisition of a phage ?M1T1Z encoding the DNase Sda1 was a sentinel evident in the epidemic of invasive M1T1 infection, promoting resistance to phagocytic clearance through evasion of neutrophil extracellular traps. The last Aim will be achieved by exploring ?M1T1Z transduction mechanisms, phage distribution in diverse M serotype strains in the U.S. and an area of high endemic GAS disease (the Australian Northern Territory), and studying the contribution of the phage to disease switching and invasive disease in non-M1T1 strain backgrounds. Project Narrative Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is a bacteria that is a leading cause of infections in humans of all ages, from simple &#191;strep throat&#191; to life-threatening &#191;flesh-eating&#191; infections and shock. Serious disease is an unusual outcome, as most people can acquire the GAS bacterium in their throat or on their skin without developing symptoms. We are studying the ways in which the GAS bacteria shifts from an innocent member of our normal flora to an invasive pathogen, using molecular genetic techniques, assays of immune function, and mouse models of infection.",GAS Switch From Colonizing Bacterium To Invasive Pathogen,2008,2014,"Nizet, Victor ",University of California San Diego,La Jolla,CA,6,1,-1,1588
5R01AI096169-02,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"The goal of this project is to generate robust, portable assay systems for the rapid detection of botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) in clinical samples. Our objective is to detect active BoNT within a 45 min test time at a limit of detection that is at least 10-fold better than the current gold standard, the live mouse bioassay. BoNT is the most potent biological toxin known. When injected, inhaled or ingested in minute amounts, BoNT elicits flaccid paralysis in humans and other mammals. However, BoNT is also widely available and used as a medical drug for cosmetic and therapeutic purposes. The availability and potential abuse of BoNT products presents a real threat to public health, and is of great concern to our national security. Our approach is based on a bead-based prototype assay with a large immuno-sorbent surface area (ALISSA) that can detect attomolar concentrations of BoNT serotype A in complex biological matrices such as blood serum and liquid foods. The BoNT ALISSA is at least four orders of magnitude more sensitive than the live mouse bioassay and considerably faster, requiring only hours instead of days. It is also much more economical and doesn't require the use of laboratory animals. To establish proof-of concept and improve the BoNT ALISSA, we propose the following Specific Aims: 1. To generate affinity reagents for microcolumn-capture of BoNT serotypes A and B (including subtypes). 2. To engineer novel substrates for BoNT-triggered dual-step enzyme cascades with bioluminescent readout for use in the ALISSA. 3. To generate affinity reagents for BoNT ALISSA detection of serotypes C, E, and F. 4. To establish the BoNT ALISSA system for serotypes A, B, C, E and F at a state laboratory of the Biodefense Laboratory Response Network for preclinical data collection on samples of infant botulism. The long term goal of the project is to obtain regulatory approval for use of the microcolumn BoNT ALISSA as a diagnostic medical device in form of an Investigational Device Exemption. The anti-BoNT affinity reagents proposed here will be generated as recombinant antibodies in form of single chain fragment variables or antigen-binding fragments and mounted onto microaffinity columns that we place into the tips of disposable plastic pipettes. The columns will be capable of immuno-capturing BoNTs in complex matrices with high affinity and specificity. Bioluminescent substrates will be produced as genetically- engineered inactive versions of luciferases that are activated by BoNTs in the microcolumn-based ALISSA. The product of this research will be an easy to use kit of biochemical reagents and affinity pipette tips that will allow rapid, sensitive BoNT detection without the need for special laboratory equipment. Used as diagnostic tools, such kits should improve public health and enhance our national biodefense preparedness.",Diagnostic Assay Systems For Botulinum Neurotoxins,2011,2016,"Kalkum, Markus ",City of Hope/Beckman Research Institute,Duarte,CA,6,1,-1,5294
5R01GM081649-05,National Institute of General Medical Sciences,93,"The goal of this research is to elucidate the structure of the prion protein in its aggregated isoforms, and to elucidate the relationship between isoform structure and different types of prion diseases. Prion protein is the causative agent of many fatal neurodegenerative diseases of mammals. These diseases are characterized by the conversion of normal, monomeric prion protein (PrPC) to a misfolded conformational state that aggregates and accumulates as fibrillar plaques in the brain. Transmission of the disease can occur when one mammal ingests the infected tissue of another. When exposed to an infectious aggregate, normal PrPC takes on the misfolded conformation and the fibrils are thus propagated. Any treatment of a prion disease must prevent or abrogate misfolding/aggregation while not affecting normal PrP function. Hence, it is important to understand the structural differences between the PrP isofoms. High resolution structures of PrPC from many mammals have been determined by both NMR and X-ray crystallography. In contrast, the insoluble, fibrillar nature of the infectious form has hampered the elucidation of its structural details. However, numerous biophysical and spectroscopic studies suggest that the misfolded form contains a much higher proportion of &#191;-sheet than normal PrP, which is mostly a-helical/random coil. This work will elucidate the nature of the PrP subunit interactions in several forms of recombinant PrP by using two biophysical techniques: site directed spin labeling (SDSL) combined with electron paramagnetic spectroscopy (EPR) and site directed crosslinking combined with mass spectrometry (MS). The EPR experiments provide information on protein backbone dynamics, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structure, distances between labeled residues, and the mobility of the label itself. The crosslinking experiments will confirm the structural information gleaned from EPR. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  The elucidation of the details of the structure of prion fibrils will be of great value in developing treatments for prion diseases, which are fatal neurodegenerative diseases of mammals. These include Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and variant CJD, Gerstmann- Straussler-Scheinker disease, Fatal Familial Insomnia, and kuru (humans), scrapie (sheep), chronic wasting disease (elk, deer), and mad cow disease (cattle). Treatment of any prion disease must prevent or abrogate fibril formation while not affecting normal prion function; hence, it is important to understand the structural differences among the different prion isofoms.",Structural Characterization Of Prion Isoforms In Multiple TSE Diseases,2008,2014,"Mcguirl, Michele Ann",University of Montana,Missoula,MT,31,1,969,3876
5U45ES019342-03,National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences,25,"The utility industry forms the core of our energy infrastructure. The public depends on its services and rightly takes for granted that the electricity is always flowing. But with this service comes a number of public and occupational hazards. Workers suffer illnesses and injuries from exposure to spills or leaks of radiation, chlorine gas, PCB-contaminated oil, sulfuric acid, or potassium permanganate. Other hazards include:  electrocution, crushing from cave-ins during excavations, asbestos, mercury, arsenic, lead, cadmium and other heavy metals to name a few. We see UWUA members at work in everyday lives, but their work hazards go unnoticed. Similarly, the public hazards from the industry such as air and water pollution and catastrophic releases of toxins often are seen as everyday circumstances until there is a dramatic accident that draws our  attention to the utility industry, such as Three Mile Island. More often than not, a worker training is the first and only line of defense to either prevent or stem hazards in the workplace or the public.  Sometimes these invisible hazards break into full view as happened during the Kingston, Tennessee coal ash spill. The spill deposited about 5.4 million cubic yards of fly ash sludge into the Emory River and its environs destroying or damaging 26 homes with an expected cleanup cost $1 Billion (2). There are less spectacular hazards of coal-fired electrical plants' combustion by-products that are reported in the EPA's Steam Electric  Power Generating Point Source Category: Final Detailed Report:  The total amount of toxic pollutants currently being released in wastewater discharges from coal-fired power plants is estimated to be significant and raises concerns regarding the long-term impacts to aquatic organisms, wildlife, and human health that are exposed to these pollutants.(3) Even though the EPA has yet to classify coal ash as hazardous waste, they are applying their own hazardous waste standard to it. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensations and Liability Act (CERCLA) is now used as the guiding standard for coal incident clean-ups. Additionally, the EPA has  determined that at least 44 other holding ponds across the United States pose a High Hazard to nearby communities (4).  Because coal fly ash sludge stored in holding ponds does not easily become airborne, it doesn't pose a severe health risk to workers. However, electrical generation workers can be exposed to dry coal ash that may become airborne in electrical generation facilities. Coal combustion by-products escape boilers that lack scrubbers. In the case of positive flow boilers, coal ash dust escapes through holes in the boiler and covers  everything around the boiler. This dry coal ash dust often contains inorganic arsenic, hexavalent chromium, mercury, and lead. When dry, this ash dust can contaminate workers through inhalation or ingestion, causing chronic health problems to exposed workers.  Utility workers are exposed to hazardous substances through a wide variety of venues. Like industrial workers they may be exposed to a broad array of hazardous chemicals that are used onsite during the manufacturing process (making electricity, purifying drinking water). Like construction workers, they may be exposed to contaminated soil during excavation/trenching operations to install, maintain or repair pipes or lines. Like  service workers they must go to industrial settings or other potentially hazardous sites to install, maintain or repair the equipment that distributes the product. Finally, like Emergency Response workers they are first responders to natural, man-made or accidental disasters to repair and to reestablish utility service.  Rationale for the training: Utility workers can be exposed to hazardous waste onsite at the generation plant; offsite in the transmission, distribution or collection system, servicing industrial and hazardous waste sites; or responding to a utility loss of service emergency. Onsite, large storage tanks of hazardous chemicals may leak and expose workers to toxins. In addition, pipes or valves that transport chemicals to treat water at  electrical generation or water purification may leak and expose workers to hazardous chemicals, including incompatibles, during maintenance and/or repair. Hazardous waste is stored at many generation plants, including spent nuclear fuel rods or slurry ponds containing chemical residue from scrubber purge, boiler blow down, metal cleaning wastewater, and miscellaneous cooling water, as well as coal combustion by-products.  Offsite, workers are exposed to unknown contaminants during maintenance or repair of underground pipes or lines. They can be exposed from toxins in the soil during excavation or, in the case of sewer workers, exposed to toxic industrial waste or medical waste in the line. Finally, utility workers are first responders to emergencies. They respond to emergencies both at their home location, as well as throughout the Nation at  pre-agreed geographical regions through Mutual Aid Pacts (MPAs) which send utility workers to repair all manner of utility service outages in the most disagreeable and dangerous conditions. Depending on the emergency, whether natural or man-made, utility service interruptions in highly dangerous chemical, petrochemical, refining, or other industrial sites, as well as hazardous waste cleanup sites, require utility workers, in  their role as first responders, to confront a variety of hazards while working to restore utility service.  The workforce of the utility industry is also in flux, which brings a different set of hazards. The industry is experiencing unprecedented changes due to former deregulation and restructuring. In addition to the reduction of workforce numbers over the years when new workers were not added to the workforce, we are now experiencing a crisis of an aging workforce. The average age of an energy utility employee is steadily rising;  since 1995 the number of industry workers aged 55 and older has increased 225%. (5) One major consequence of this has been the loss of experienced workers primarily through retirement and attrition, and with them, the loss of institutional memory of workplace health and safety. It is predicted that this loss will continue and accelerate, with an estimated 50% of the workforce retiring in the next 4 to 8 years (6). The remaining managers and workers struggle to adapt to a rapidly changing structure, while continuing to provide essential services such as power-grid infrastructure maintenance, electrical power distribution, sewage recovery and treatment, gas distribution, and water purification and distribution.  Training is now and will increasingly be essential to provide a safe and healthy workplace. That is why the UWUA has established the Power4America to partner with management to begin the process of ensuring the necessary training resources for these crucial years. Additionally we are reaching out to the community in anticipation of this need and will be conducting outreach health and safety training for prospective workers.  This training will help prepare these community members to work safely in these facilities once they are employed. We will focus our recruitment efforts on underserved members of the community surrounding our represented NRC facilities in the first year of the grant. If funded we will extend this training to other facilities nationwide in future grant years'.  Members ofthe UWUA occupy a wide variety of positions that compose the utility industry, including electricians, mechanics, steam operators, underground maintenance workers, overhead line workers, nuclear power operators (and other nuclear classifications), transformer personnel, painters, and office personnel.  UWUA members need training because their work environment exposes them to accidents and injuries due to exposure to hazardous substances. By the nature of the work, utility workers must move throughout their service areas, including waste disposal or industrial sites to maintain and repair their utility lines. Water, sewage, and electrical transmission and distribution workers must be prepared to respond to emergencies either at their own utility or through MPAs to an emergency in another locale caused by a natural disaster,  terrorist event, or accidental catastrophe. Whether onsite, offsite or in an emergency response situation, acute or chronic injury and disease associated with the clean-up of a hazardous substance release or an accidental release of radiation from spent fuel rods or toxic airborne coal ash waste, may chronically impair their health and that ofthe surrounding communities.  The Need: It is no secret that our infrastructure is in sorry shape. It is estimated that hundreds of billions of dollars are needed to rebuild our power lines, our water mains, and our gas pipelines. In the meantime, utility workers engage in reactive maintenance: they must deal with thousands of water main breaks, fallen powerlines and gas-line repairs, especially in the winter months. To deal with the massive weather emergencies like  hurricanes, tornadoes, and winter storms, utilities often borrow crews from each other in a mutual aid system.  It is very difficult and chaotic process but, for the most part, it has kept our electricity, water, and gas available to the public and the industry. It is during these emergency responses that utility workers come in contact with hazardous situations, depending upon the emergency they are responding to. New York Times reporter James Barron provided a small glimpse ofthe magnitude ofthe problem faced by utility workers when he was  describing an underground steam-pipe explosion caused by a nearby water main break. Two utility workers and a pedestrian were killed in this explosion and 24 others were injured. It's a jungle down there. Beneath the 23 square miles of Manhattan are 11 million miles of telephone wires, 19,000 miles of electrical cable,  6,000 miles of water mains, 4,000 miles of gas lines, 100 miles of cable television wires and 105 miles of steam pipes.

2R01GM078221-06,National Institute of General Medical Sciences,93,"Antibodies play a critical role in the immune system for recognition of foreign intruders. Because of their excellent affinity and specificity, they hav also been exploited as therapeutic molecules and biotechnological components for sensing and assembly. Structures of antibodies in complex with their antigens can yield insight into biological  phenomena or drug and disease mechanisms. However, structures of antibodies and antibody-antigen complexes can be difficult, time consuming, and expensive to determine. The proposed research focuses on the computational prediction of the structure of antibodies and antibody-antigen complexes. Computational approaches are particularly important because the repertoire of antibodies in a human patient is far too large for complete structural characterization by experiment. Prior work has isolated the most critical challenges: most of the antibodies in the human repertoire have hypervariable CDR H3 loops longer than that which is predictable using current loop methods; backbone conformational uncertainty and flexibility confound current docking methods; and no current method can quantitatively predict antibody-antigen binding affinities from structure. Thus, the first three aims of the project are to (1) develop new methods  to predict the structure of long CDR H3 loops using statistics to identify likely &#191; turns, (2) develop flexible backbone docking routines using an expanded ensemble approach with a conformational web, and (3) develop methods to quantitatively predict protein-protein binding affinity using improved electrostatics treatments. Finally, the fourth aim will be to (4) use existng and proposed methods to predict structures of antibodies and antibody-antigen complexes for entire polyclonal antibody repertoires. Structures will be predicted for antibody repertoires determined from bone marrow plasma cells of mice immunized against ovalbumin (a food allergen) and enzyme C1s (a therapeutic target for autoimmune diseases and transplant tolerance). Ultimately, these studies will yield insights into immunology, molecular recognition, and design of protein-protein interfaces and vaccines.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Antibodies play a critical role in the immune system for recognition of foreign intruders, and are excellent therapeutic molecules because of their high affinity and specificity.

5R43AI096683-02,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) are the most potent protein toxins known. Given their potent toxicity and their potential use in bio-warfare scenarios, BoNTs are included among the Category A select agents. The currently available pentavalent toxoid vaccine requires multiple boosters before being effective, and protects unequally against the different BoNT serotypes.  There is a critical need for BoNT vaccines that will induce rapid protection in situations where the threat of BoNT exposure is imminent as well as to provide effective immune responses to each constituent of a multivalent vaccine. To achieve rapid and more robust immune responses to Hc we have pursued a strategy of linking Hc antigens to R4, a novel adjuvant developed by us that efficiently loads vaccine antigens onto dendritic cells (DCs). By specifically targeting the Hc antigen to DCs, the critical early steps in the immune response are hastened. We have expressed BoNT/A Hc as a fusion protein with R4 to produce HcR4 and have demonstrated that HcR4 induces more rapid and robust immune responses to BoNT/A Hc antigen than can be achieved using the Hc antigen alone. Based on these results we hypothesize that an effective rapid- acting multivalent vaccine against BoNTs can be developed using HcR4 fusion proteins.  The goal of this project is to advance the development of a new class of BoNT vaccines that represent a significant improvement over current vaccine technologies. The proposed studies will achieve these goals through development of HcR4 ligands for BoNT serotypes B and E for use in combination with the already produced and characterized BoNT/A HcR4 as a multivalent vaccine. We will test whether this multivalent vaccine can generate rapid and protective immune responses to BoNTs when administered as a single or multidose parenteral vaccine. In addition, the multivalent BoNT vaccine will be tested as a mucosal vaccine for the generation of systemic and mucosal immune responses to BoNT.  This project will achieve the next milestones in the development of the HcR4 ligands: 1) We will develop HcR4 immunogens for BoNT serotypes B and E for use in combination with the already developed and characterized BoNT/A HcR4. 2) We will establish the efficacy of a multivalent HcR4 vaccine as a rapid- protection, one-shot vaccine, and as a multi-dose vaccine, and; 3) Determine if mucosal/nasal administration of HcR4 can result in the rapid induction of systemic and mucosal antibody responses against BoNTs.  These studies are intended to deliver sufficient proof-of-principle for advancing the polyvalent BoNT vaccine into clinical development.

Prions seem to be composed solely of PrPSc molecules, which are derived from a precursor PrPc by a  poorly understood process. The studies described here are aimed at defining the structure of PrPSc,  characterizing the interactions of small molecules with both PrPc and PrPSc and dissecting the molecular  events governing the propagation of different human prion strains. In Project 1, we propose to study the  interactions of polyoxometalates (POMs) with PrP,S c . The POM phosphotungstate anion [PW12O40] (PTA)  binds specifically to PrPSc, but not to PrP . POMs are a large class of inorganic metal oxide clusters with rigid  polyhedral structures displaying substantial variations in size, shape, and charge density. In Project 2, we  propose to carry out fiber diffraction studies of the 55-residue MoPrP(89-143,P101L) peptide that causes  inherited prion disease, a 20 mer wt PrP(106-126) peptide known to form amyloid fibrils as well as purified  truncated (PrP 27-30) and full-length PrPSc, both of which are infectious in wild-type animals. In Project 3, we  propose to study the prions causing sCJD. These studies are possible because our most sensitive Tg mouse  line expressing chimeric human/mouse PrP succumbs to disease in ~80 days after inoculation with sCJD  prions. Relatively rapid bioassays of human prions in these Tg mice make it practical to measure the titers of  prions throughout brain as well as in peripheral organs and body fluids collected from dead sCJD patients.  We also propose to develop guinea pig models of sCJD and variant (v) CJD. In Project 4, we propose to  discover new ligands that bind to and stabilize human PrPc. We also plan to determine whether such ligands  inhibit the conversion of HuPrPc into HuPrPSc. Using a virtual screening approach, large libraries of organic  molecules will be docked against the known structure of HuPrPc.

5R01AI060557-09,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Of the global 57 million deaths each year, about 1.8 (WHO) to 2.2 (UNESCO) million are due to infections with enteric pathogens including Salmonella, Escherichia coli and Shigella sp., and other entero-pathogens such as Yersinia sp., Vibrio cholerae, Campylobacter jejuni, Helicobacter pylori, Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium perfringens and C. difficile. These pathogens are responsible for significant morbidity and are transmitted to humans by contaminated food and water. In developing countries, bacterial enteropathogens in food animals are major factors that decrease productivity of livestock creating food shortages and under-nourishment in humans. We believe that improving health, nutrition and economic well-being (the latter dependent on the first two) provide the best means to enhance the quality of life globally. We therefore spent much effort to devise new improved means to construct recombinant attenuated Salmonella vaccine vector systems for animals and humans that are capable of inducing cross-protective immunity to enteric pathogens and of delivering genus- or species-specific protective antigens to further enhance induction of immunity to enteric pathogens. We propose to use these technologies to develop vaccines to prevent/reduce diarrheal diseases caused by bacterial enteropathogens in agriculturally important animals and humans. Our objectives include to: (i) complete construction of S. Typhimurium and S. Paratyphi A strains with regulated delayed attenuation attributes to expose and display cross-protective surface antigens, that minimize induction of immune responses to serotype-specific antigens, that possess mutations to enhance safety and immunogenicity, that can delivery multiple genus- and species-specific protective antigens and that display biological containment to preclude persistence in vivo or survival if excreted, (ii) complete construction of multiple vector systems using balanced-lethal, balanced-attenuation and regulated-lysis vector systems to maximize induction of protective immune responses by delivery of conserved protective antigens of Shigella, Yersinia, E. coli, C. jejuni and C. perfringens, (iii) conduct studies to evaluate (a) how best to maximize induction of cross-protective immunity, (b) ability to induce protective immunity against specific enteric pathogens, (c) consequences of vaccination on normal flora, (d) efficacy of mixtures of vaccines to protect against Salmonella and one or two other species versus a vaccine to protect against multiple enteric bacterial pathogens, and (e) means to experimentally validate a vaccine for humans to protect against multiple pathogens, and (iv) conduct studies to provide preclinical safety and efficacy data to satisfy APHIS for veterinary vaccines and FDA for human vaccines.

5R44AI051103-06,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"ABSTRACT  Among inhibitors of Gram+ DNA polymerases IIIC and IIIE, several compounds are active against multiple strains of the anaerobic Gram+ bacterium Clostridium difficile (Cdiff). The compounds appear to be selective for Cdiff compared with other Gram+ anaerobes and aerobes, and a lead compound - 2-(3,4-dichlorobenzyl)- 7-(5-morpholinylpentyl)guanine or 359E - is active orally in protecting hamsters from lethal Cdiff infection. The compounds of interest are poorly absorbed orally and too weak to be developed for systemic use against Gram+ aerobe infections. Compound 359E and analogs are tertiary amines, readily form water soluble salts, and are highly effective against Cdiff in vitro and in vivo. Given the increasing prevalence of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD), including that from highly virulent, toxin-overproducing and/or antibiotic- resistant strains, the need for new and selective antibacterials to treat this disease is growing. Our phase II results strongly suggest that development of the lead compound or an alternative as an oral treatment for Cdiff diarrhea in human patients will result in a novel, first in class drug to treat this emerging infectious disease.  The specific aims of the competing renewal of this project are focused on preclinical development of 359E or a closely related lead compound (LC). The aims are to: 1, scale up and begin process development for 359E; 2, determine the mechanism of action, selectivity, anticlostridial spectrum, and resistance development of 359E; 3, determine oral safety, anti-clostridial efficacy, and absorption of 359E in the hamster; 4, synthesize and screen analogs of 359E as backup LC compounds, and designate a candidate for development (CD). Once this has occurred, IND-enabling studies will commence. These include: 5, in vitro ADME studies; 6, preclincal analytical, toxicology and toxicokinetic studies; 7, safety pharmacology and genotoxicity studies; 8, cGMP production of the CD. Once all preclinical studies have been completed, aim 9 will encompass preparation an IND application for the CD as oral treatment for CDAD.  Incidence of CDAD is on the rise in the United States and Europe, and Cdiff is the major identified infectious cause of nosocomial diarrhea in patients to whom antibiotics had been previously administered. Vancomycin and metronidazole are first-line therapy for treatment of CDAD, but there have been reports of treatment failure and CDAD recurrence after treatment with metronidazole, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has discouraged vancomycin for treatment of CDAD in hospitals to minimize the risk of vancomycin-resistant enterococci and staphylococci. Various treatments are in clinical trials and preclinical development for Cdiff infections, ranging from direct-acting antibacterials to vaccines and compounds to neutralize Cdiff toxins. The results of our phase II studies indicated the strong likelihood that a DNA polymerase III inhibitor will be an effective and non-toxic oral treatment of CDAD.",Preclinical Development Of A Novel Antibacterial For Clostridium Difficile Diseas,2001,2014,"Wright, George E","Glsynthesis, Inc.",Worcester,MA,26,1,-1,4870

The intestinal microbiota is largely composed of mutualistic bacteria which play many important roles in human health, including aiding in digestion and helping to fend off infection caused by pathogenic bacteria. However, little is known about the strategies employed by resident microbes to resist pathogen invasion or adapt to physiological changes associated with infection such as inflammation and diarrhea. The focus of this project is to understand how members of our resident microbiota resist or adapt to intestinal inflammation caused by the enteric pathogen, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Transcriptional profiling of gut-resident mutualists will be used to identify important pathways involved in response to inflammation. Genetic manipulation of the model gut mutualist Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron will be combined with in vivo approaches that utilize gnotobiotic mice colonized with defined simplified microbial communities or colonized with a complete human microbiota to define relevant pathways and the functions of these pathways. These studies will shed light on the mechanisms that underlie the emergence of intestinal pathogens and identify the functional adaptations employed by the microbiota during Salmonella infection in vivo.

The long term goal and significance of this proposal is to better understand the development of oral tolerance to foods. Our approach will be to study the basophil/mast cell reactivity, antigen-specific T cell responses and mucosal and systemic humoral immune responses in these subjects on anti-IgE and peanut OIT. Our hypothesis is that by beginning treatment with anti-IgE and then starting peanut OIT we will clinically desensitize patients by altering basophil/mast cell reactivity and will cause eventual clinical tolerance to develop because of the activity of allergen-specific T regulatory cells.  Previous studies of peanut OIT from our group of investigators show that during the first 6 - 9 months of OIT the subjects become desensitized to peanuts and will tolerate up to 15 peanuts without symptoms. For those subjects on treatment with OIT longer than 2 1/2 years, more than 50% are now clinically tolerant to peanuts.  The clinical study this proposal is attached to is a prospective trial at Duke University with peanut-allergic subjects. We will enroll 10 patients. The study will consist of 4 phases: anti-IgE therapy before immunotherapy, a modified rush day(s), a build-up period of 4 months, and a daily home maintenance phase with a final dose of 8000mg peanut flour (~50% peanut protein). The anti-IgE will be started 4 months prior to the initial modified rush day(s) and continued for one month after they have reached the daily maintenance dose of peanut OIT (8 gms) (total anti-IgE time 10 months). Importantly, we will conduct the following mechanistic studies at the beginning of treatment with anti-IgE, prior to starting peanut OIT and then at various appropriate intervals thereafter to determine the individual and collective contribution of anti-IgE and peanut OIT to the immune changes.  We want to establish an immunotherapeutic approach that would down-regulate food specific immune responses, lower the risk of allergic reactions to accidental exposure to foods in the millions of Americans who suffer from food allergy and develop an eventual treatment that will cause true clinical tolerance. This study will provide new insights into peanut-specific cellular and humoral immune responses and oral tolerance.",Combined Peanut Oral Immunotherapy And Anti-IgE: Mechanistic Studies,2011,2013,"Burks, A.

5R01AI089489-03,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"An estimated 3-4 million children below the age of 5 years die each year as a result of complications related to diarrhea. Every year in the United States, there are an estimated 211 to 375 million episodes of acute diarrhea resulting in 5,000 deaths. The number and diversity of diarrhea causing pathogens, including viruses, bacteria, and protozoa along with the similarities in clinical presentation pose significant problems for diagnosis. Current microbiological methods used to identify the responsible pathogen are slow and laborious requiring days for a result. While individual patients suffer from these testing limitations, public health is also threatened by outbreaks that spread undetected. Idaho Technology Inc. (ITI) has developed the FilmArray System, an innovative molecular diagnostics device that streamlines pathogen identification in human samples. The FilmArray System simultaneously identifies up to 27 organisms in ~1 hour, and requires only a minimally trained operator to perform the test. The FilmArray System comprises a uniquely designed lab-in-a-pouch, which together with the FilmArray instrument, automatically performs all steps needed for detection and identification of pathogens, from nucleic acid extraction to multiplex real time PCR and data analysis. The goal of this project is to adopt this technology and incorporate assays, protocols and consumables to accurately identify the presence of 22 diarrhea- associated pathogens. ITI proposes the following Aims to develop and evaluate the FilmArray Gastrointestinal (GI) Pathogen System. In Aim 1, the assays to detect diarrhea causing pathogens and the protocols to extract nucleic acids from stool will be developed and then combined to make the FilmArray GI pouch. The FilmArray instrument software will be adapted for the interpretation of the GI pathogen assays. The assays in FA GI pouch will be validated using stool samples that have been shown to be positive by conventional tests. After validation the FA GI pouches will be transferred from R & D to ITI's production facility so that pouches can be produced under current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP). Transfer will require quality control (QC) of raw materials and the final product, documentation of formulations and dispense protocols for reaction mixtures and pilot lot production. In Aim 2, analytic testing will be performed to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the system, examine reproducibility, identify possible interferants in stool, and evaluate the potential for contamination between tests. The performance of the FA GI System will be evaluated in a clinical setting as a test of the feasibility of applying for FDA clearance of the FA GI System as an In Vitro Diagnostic Device. A large set of previously characterized archived stool samples and a small set of fresh samples will be tested using the FA GI Diagnostic System at Primary Children Medical Center (PCMC), Salt Lake City, UT. The challenge in diagnosing infectious diarrhea is the large number and diversity of the pathogens that are known to cause diarrhea, including viruses, bacteria and protozoa. We propose to develop the FilmArray Gastrointestinal Pathogen System, a rapid (<1 hour), automated, sensitive, objective and inexpensive test able to detect 22 diarrhea causing pathogens in a single step. This novel tool will overcome diagnostic difficulties, improve the treatment and reduce the cost of diarrheal illness for individual patients, and improve public health by rapid detection of outbreaks.

5R01AI018045-32,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"The bacterium Vibrio cholerae is the cause of a lethal diarrheal disease called cholera. This organism commonly inhabits aquatic environments where it encounters unicellular eukaryotic `grazers' such as amoeba and ciliates which prey on bacterial cells. However, V. cholerae apparently has acquired gene clusters that provide some resistance to this predation and these genes may allow it to become a human pathogen. Two such groups of genes provide the blueprint for construction of Type III and Type VI secretion systems (T3SS and T6SS). These nanomachines allow V. cholerae puncturing amoeba and human cells and then injecting into them toxic proteins. Many other bacteria express T3SS and T6SS and thus they are exciting targets for development of drugs and vaccines. We have shown that T3SS and T6SS are important virulence factors in appropriate infection models for cholera but do not understand exactly how these systems enhance virulence properties such as intestinal colonization and fluid secretion responses. This proposal seeks funding for a research program to address the following general questions about the V. cholerae T3SS and T6SS: 1) Do T3SS effectors cause dynamic movements of host cell membranes in ways that provide an explanation for the pattern of adherence of V. cholerae to target cells? 2) Do injected effectors proteins of T3SS mediate adherence of V. cholerae to host cells by translocating a receptor that is recognized by a bacterial adhesin? 3) Does this translocated receptor transit through host cell by passing through subcellular compartments such as the ER and Golgi? 4) Can we define the mechanistic flexibility of the V. cholerae T6SS by proving that it can translocate heterologous proteins and effectors domains? 5) Can we understand the role of phagocytosis in the delivery of a toxic T6SS effector? 6) What is the mechanism of T6SS regulation and the roles of essential T6SS genes in the secretion and injection process? 7) Can we utilize highly parallel `systems biology' platforms such as protein chips and high-throughput genetics to define protein-protein interactions, novel immune activators and targets fo antimicrobial compound discovery?

5R01AI030492-24,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"One of the most significant developments in the field of bacterial pathogenesis research in the last few years has been the discovery that many bacterial pathogens have evolved complex specialized machines to transfer multiple bacterially-encoded proteins into eukaryotic cells. One of this type of machines is the type III secretion system (T3SS). A great deal of attention has been devoted to the study of these systems because they are essential virulence determinants for the bacterial pathogens that encode them. Proteins delivered by these machines have the capacity to modulate a variety of cellular functions and are collectively known as effectors. Through work supported by this Grant, we have been studying a T3SS from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium), encoded within its pathogenicty island 1 (SPI-1). This system mediates several phenotypes that are essential for virulence including bacterial entry into and survival within non-phagocytic cells, the induction of programmed cell death in macrophages, and the stimulation of innate immune responses and inflammation in the intestinal tract. During the previous funding period we have made important discoveries that have significantly advanced our knowledge of this system and T3SSs in general. During the next funding period, we intend to continue this line of investigation, focusing our efforts on less-well understood aspects of T3SSs. More specifically, we propose to use a multidisciplinary approach to: 1) To investigate the function of the export apparatus of the S. Typhimurium SPI-1 T3SS; 2) To investigate the function of InvA, a core component of the T3SS; 3) To investigate the composition and assembly of the SpaO- organized platform; and 4) To obtain a high resolution in situ view of the S. Typhimurium SPI-1 T3SS. It is hoped that accomplishing these objectives will not only enhance our understanding of Salmonella spp. pathogenesis but also our understanding of T3SSs in general. Since this system is central to the pathogenesis of many important pathogenic bacteria, these studies may provide the bases for the development of broadly applicable anti-infective strategies.

7R21AI092007-03,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Vibrio cholerae is a Gram-negative pathogen that causes a debilitating diarrheal disease that affects an estimated 5-10 million people each year. The ability of V. cholerae to cause epidemic disease is dependent on the coordinated expression of genes in vivo. Recent work has shown that many V. cholerae genes are temporally expressed in vivo. For example the genes encoding for the production of cholera toxin and the toxin coregulated pilus are induced early in infection, but repressed prior to exiting the host. Other genes are repressed early in infection and induced late in infection. One of the key questions in cholera research is how these genes are regulated in vivo. Quorum sensing has been proposed as a model for coordinate regulation of genes in vivo. However, a major shortcoming of the quorum-sensing model is that it fails to explain late gene regulation in widespread quorum sensing negative epidemic strains. In this application we present preliminary data to show that cyclic peptides function as quorum sensing independent signals that effect virulence gene regulation. We propose two specific aims to expand on these preliminary findings. In Aim 1 we will identify potent cyclic peptide inhibitors of virulence factor production and characterize their effects on virulence gene expression. In Aim 2 we will test whether the peptide inhibitors function in vivo. The completion of these aims will confirm the role of cyclic peptides in virulence gene expression and provide a novel mechanism for gene regulation during infection.",Peptide Effectors Of Virulence Factor Production In Vibrio Cholerae,2010,2013,"Bina, James Edward",University of Pittsburgh At Pittsburgh,Pittsburgh,PA,45,1,-1,4880
5R37DK056061-14,National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,24,"Project Summary:   The long-term objective of this renewal application is to continue our investigations into  the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the intestinal absorption process of the water-  soluble vitamin B1 (thiamin) and their regulation. We also aim at examining the effect of  infection with enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), a common intestinal pathogen, on the intestinal  thiamin absorption process.   Thiamin is essential for normal cellular functions and its deficiency (which represents a  significant nutritional problem) leads to a variety of clinical abnormalities including  cardiovascular and neurological disorders. Humans (and other mammals) cannot synthesize  thiamin, and thus, must obtain the vitamin via intestinal absorption. Studies during the current  funding period have characterized many aspects of the intestinal thiamin uptake process. These  include characterization of the 5' -regulatory regions of the genes of the human thiamin  transporters 1 & 2 (hTHTR-1 & hTHTR-2) both in vitro and in vivo, demonstration that the  intestinal thiamin uptake process is adaptively up-regulated in thiamin deficiency via  transcriptionally-mediated mechanism(s) and that the process also undergoes differentiation- and  developmental- dependent regulation. We have also characterized the mechanisms involved in  membrane targeting and intracellular trafficking of the thiamin transporters in epithelial cells.   Using gene specific siRNA approaches, recent studies from our laboratory have shown  that both the hTHTR 1 & 2 are involved in thiamin uptake by a human intestinal epithelial Caco-  2 cell line in vitro. Nothing is known about the role of these thiamin transporters in thiamin  uptake in the native intestine. Thus, in new preliminary studies we have developed an Slc19a3-/-  knockout mouse model and showed significant impairment in intestinal thiamin uptake  compared to wild-type mice; we have also established a colony of Slc19a2-/- knockout mice in  our laboratory. In addition, we have used the bacterial two-hybrid system to screen a human  intestinal cDNA library and have identified two putative proteins that can interact with hTHTR-1  (tetraspanin and E-cadherin-1). Furthermore, we have examined the effect of the  enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) and found significant inhibition in thiamin uptake.  Based on our previous and new preliminary findings, our aims in this proposal are: 1) To further  characterize the intestinal thiamin absorption process using Slc19a2 -/-and Slc19a3 -/- knockout  mouse models and to determine the role of THTR-1 and THTR-2 in trans-epithelial and trans-  membrane transport events in the native intestine, 2) To identify the cis-regulatory elements and  trans-acting nuclear factors involved in the adaptive up-regulation of thiamin uptake in thiamin  deficiency, 3) To identify proteins that interact with hTHTR-1 and hTHTR-2 in human intestinal  epithelial cells and to understand their biological/physiological roles, and 4) to determine the  cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in EPEC inhibition of the intestinal thiamin uptake  process.   Results of these studies should continue to provide novel and valuable information  regarding the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the intestinal thiamin uptake  process and their regulation as well as of the factors that negatively impact the process. This  should ultimately assist us in the designing of effective strategies to optimize thiamin body  homeostasis in conditions associated with thiamin deficiency and sub-optimal levels, and in  minimizing the effect of exogenous factors that may negatively impact this nutritional parameter.",Mechanism/Regulation Of Intestinal Thiamin Uptake,1999,2014,"Said, Hamid M",University of California-Irvine,Irvine,CA,6,1,-1,-1
1R01AI098771-01,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"As highlighted in the 'Bad Bugs, No Drugs' campaign by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), There simply aren't enough new drugs in the pharmaceutical pipeline to keep pace with drug-resistant bacterial infections, so-called 'superbugs'. Numerous hospitals worldwide have experienced outbreaks of infections caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter species, Enterococcus faecium and Staphyloccocus aureus. All of these pathogens are on the IDSA 'hit list' of the six top-priority dangerous microorganisms ESKAPE that require the most urgent attention to discover new antibiotics.  Sadly, no novel antibiotics against MDR P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii and K. pneumoniae will be available for many years to come. Polymyxins (i.e. colistin and polymyxin B) are now being used as the 'last-line' of therapy for infections caused by these very problematic MDR pathogens. Very unfortunately, emergence of polymyxin resistance has been increasingly reported recently. In essence, resistance to polymyxins implies a total lack of antibiotics for treatment of life-threatening infections caused by these Gram-negative bacteria.  Research Design: Using a new structure-activity relationship (SAR)-based mechanistic model for polymyxins, novel lipopeptides we designed and synthesized showed very promising activity against polymyxin-resistant MDR strains of P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii and K. pneumoniae, while maintaining activity against polymyxin- susceptible strains. Remarkably, a number of these lipopeptides were also active against MDR strains of two Gram-positive 'superbugs'. Our approach, based upon modeling the interaction between polymyxins and the lipid A of lipopolysaccharides (LPS), is novel. Our hypothesis is that polymyxin resistance in Gram-negative and/or Gram-positive bacteria is overcome by modifications of the core polymyxin structure. A systematic funneling approach with feedback loops will allow us to 'learn' as much as possible at early stages about the SAR to inform the design of superior lipopeptides.      Aim 1: To design, synthesize and evaluate microbiologically ~125 novel lipopeptides active against: (a) polymyxin-resistant Gram-negative 'superbugs' using an SAR-based mechanistic model; and (b) problematic MDR Gram-positive E. faecium and S. aureus. Three series of lipopeptides will be designed and synthesized to enhance (i) hydrophobic interactions, (ii) polar interactions, and (iii) a combination of both, with lipid A. Pharmacological evaluations in Specifi Aims 3 and 4 will provide important information for improvement of the model and design of superior lipopeptides.  Aim 2: To elucidate the mechanism(s) of activity of the lipopeptides against both Gram-negative and -positive pathogens. Confocal microscopic, transcriptomic and biochemical approaches will be employed to examine the antibacterial activity of our lipopeptides against both Gram-negative and -positive pathogens. The results will provide valuable mechanistic information for designing more active lead lipopeptides (Specific Aim 1).  Aim 3: To conduct lead optimization based upon characterization of pharmacodynamics, potential for development of resistance and toxicity, and physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties. In the lead optimization process, we will measure the minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations of lipopeptides against a large panel of strains. Potential for development of resistance, hemolysis, cytotoxicity and nephrotoxicity, and physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties, will be assessed. In addition, the interactions with LPS will be studied. Information obtained will be fed back to improve the SAR model (Specific Aim 1). Advanced lead lipopeptides will be identified and proceed to animal studies in Specific Aim 4.  Aim 4: To evaluate the in vivo efficacy, toxicity and PK/PD properties for 5 - 10 superior lipopeptides using animal infection models, and to identify 1 - 2 candidates for IND/Phase-1 evaluations. Neutropenic mouse thigh and lung infection models will be employed to evaluate the in vivo efficacy of the advanced leads. Formulations for intravenous delivery will be developed for the candidates before the first dose in man.      Aim 5: To conduct IND-enabling toxicology studies. Scale-up of the active pharmaceutical ingredient to conduct range-finding toxicology studies in rats and non-rodent species, and ultimately IND-enabling GLP toxicology and safety pharmacology studies.  Even though it is beyond the scope of this RFA, we are very enthusiastic that the identified candidates will be taken to the IND/Phase 1 study with financial support from Mpex. Significance: As highlighted in the WHO World Health Day 2011, no action today means no cure tomorrow. This project holds great promise for development of novel antibiotics against the six top-priority ESKAPE 'superbugs' identified by the IDSA, in particular polymyxin-resistant MDR P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii and K. pneumoniae. Overall, this project targets the urgent global unmet medical need and responds in a timely manner to the recent global call for discovery of new antibiotics: The 10 x '20 Initiative.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The world is facing an enormous and growing threat from the emergence of bacteria that are resistant to all available antibiotics while in the past few decades  there has been a marked decline in discovery of novel antibiotics.

5P01ES006052-19,National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences,25,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major cause of cancer morbidity and mortality in many parts of Asia,  including China and Thailand, and in sub-Saharan Africa, where there are upwards of 600,000 new cases  and deaths each year. The impact of HCC is exacerbated by a median age of diagnosis of between 45 and  50 years and it is nearly always fatal. The major known etiological factors associated with development of  HCC in these regions are infection with hepatitis B (HBV) and/or hepatitis C (HCV) virus and lifetime  exposure to high levels of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) in the diet. HCC is also the most rapidly rising solid tumor in  the US and is overrepresented in minority communities.

5R01AI078951-03,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Given the well-known pathogenicity of Staphylococcus aureus, the emergence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA) is causing increased public health concerns. More than 60% of S. aureus-associated hospital acquired infections are caused by MRSA, which has increasingly spread beyond healthcare facilities and has emerged as a community pathogen. The annual cost to treat MRSA in hospitalized patients in the U.S. is estimated to be between $3.2 billion to 4.2 billion. The threat of VRSA has been the topic of intensive research since there is a limited drug of choice for MRSA infections. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop more efficient preventive and/or therapeutic agents to fight this pathogen. We have demonstrated that a staphylococcal putative glycoprotease (Gcp) is a unique antibacterial target since it is cell-wall associated and secreted, essential for survival for both Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens. However, the biological function of the putative glycoprotease is still unclear. Without a biochemical readout phenotype, it is difficult for us to develop a high-throughput screen of inhibitors against this novel target. Combined microarray and proteomic approaches with a regulated RNA interference technology, we found that the down-regulation of gcp expression significantly increases the productions of acetolactate synthase, dihydroxy-acid dehydratase and threonine dehydratase, which are located in the same metabolic pathway in S. aureus. Therefore, we hypothesize that these enzymes are the surrogate markers of Gcp and monitoring Gcp's biomarkers will provide a powerful approach to high-throughput screen inhibitors against Gcp. The objective of this proposal is to develop a whole cell-based high throughput assay using these elevated proteins as Gcp's surrogate biomarkers. In specific aim 1, we will construct bioluminescent reporter systems using Gcp's surrogate markers in S. aureus. In specific aim 2, we will perform high-throughput screening of novel chemical leads against this essential putative glycoprotease using the bioluminescent reporter systems. In specific aim 3, we will validate lead compounds to determine their mode of action, specificity, and selectivity. Successful completion of these studies will identify potential inhibitors against this novel, unique antibacterial target, Gcp, as well as provide a novel strategy for high-throughput screening of compounds against other functional unknown targets. Therefore, the proposed studies will provide a novel strategy for high-throughput screening of compounds against novel drug target that will be particularly important to therapeutic interventions for infections and medical practice to fight the emerging antibiotic-resistant S. aureus.

5F32AI092967-02,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Shigella sp. cause 550 million cases of diarrhea or dysentery and 1.1 million deaths annually worldwide. S. flexneri are intracytoplasmic gram negative bacteria which cause disease by invasion and spread through the colonic mucosa. Survival and spread of S. flexneri are mediated by bacterial manipulation of the host cytoskeleton. In the host cell cytoplasm, bacteria initiate nucleation and polymerization of actin filaments at one pole, forming a propulsive actin tail. The bacterial outer membrane protein IcsA is required for actin tail assembly in conjunction with host factors including actin nucleator Arp 2/3, actin nucleation promoting factor N-WASP, and Toca-1. In resting cells, N-WASP is maintained in an autoinhibited conformation and is activated by Cdc42 in conjunction with Toca-1. Activation of N-WASP during S. flexneri actin tail assembly is independent of Cdc42, and we have recently shown that N-WASP activation requires Toca-1. Our studies indicate that Toca-1 plays a role in relieving autoinhibition of N-WASP during actin tail formation. Once activated, N-WASP associated with S. flexneri does not require the presence of Toca-1 for ongoing actin polymerization. N-WASP associated with S. flexneri shows shifted migration on SDS-PAGE compared to N-WASP from cell lysate, suggesting that a covalent modification has been induced by S. flexneri. The goals of my research are to: I) Characterize the modification made to N-WASP by S. flexneri and determine the effect of this modification on N-WASP conformation and actin polymerization, II) Determine the effect of the modification to N-WASP on cell motility and invasion and III) Identify the bacterial factor responsible for making this modification to N-WASP. Understanding mechanisms by which S. flexneri modulates the host cytoskeleton will generate insights into the mechanisms of bacterial manipulation of the host cytoskeleton relevant to Shigella pathogenesis and perhaps to the pathogenesis of other organisms as well. Moreover, because N-WASP activity is highly regulated by the cell, the results of the proposed studies are likely to lead to insights into the fundamental mechanisms of cellular modulation and control of actin polymerization.

5R01AI042797-15,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Pathogenic Yersinia species use a virulence plasmid encoded type III secretion system to transport effector proteins (Yops) via a needle structure into the cytoplasm of immune cells, thereby preventing phagocytic clearance of the invading pathogen. Yersinia type III secretion machines are constructed from 26 Ysc proteins, forming a needle-like structure and creating a conduit through which effectors are injected into host cells. Type III machines assume rotational symmetry and several of their components share significant structural homology with the basal body of flagella and with type III machines of other bacteria. Assembly of type III machines requires the secretion of early substrates, namely YscF, which polymerizes into the hollow needle structure, as well as YscP and YopR. Once needle formation is completed, middle substrates, known as translocators, are deposited at the needle tip (LcrV) or in the plasma membrane of host cells (YopB and YopD) to generate the translocation pore. Type III machines encounter a drop in perceived calcium levels in the cytosol of host cells, which is thought to impact the structure of the needle and trigger the transport of late substrates, for example YopE effector, a GTPase activating protein (GAP). Our experimental inquiries are concerned with the events that enable Yersinia to select substrates for organized assembly or secretion by type III machines. Using translational hybrids of early, middle and late substrates with reporter proteins that do or do not pass through the secretion machine, we observed that entry into the pathway requires at least two signals. N-terminal signals initiate all substrates into the type III pathway and these are likely decoded by features of mRNAs that encode proteins destined for travel. Secondary signals are positioned downstream and establish order, i.e. they determine the sequence of assembly and transport events. One of these secondary signals, a stem-loop structure in the 3' coding sequence of yopR mRNA, promotes selection of its product as an early substrate, presumably by programming ribosomes for secretion. Switches in substrate recognition occur at the level of each needle complex and are associated with autoproteolytic cleavage of YscU, the switch protein, and its variable interaction with other machine components, including the type III ATPase complex (YscN-YscK-YscL-YscQ) and YscO. Goal of this proposal is to understand the mechanisms whereby type III machines select substrates for ordered secretion reactions. Further, utilization of newly developed microscopy technologies can now reveal the mechanisms whereby Yersinia select primary host cells for type III injection. Detailed appreciation of how bacterial pathogens use type III machines will enable therapeutic intervention and prevention of many different infectious diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Type III machines enable bacterial pathogens to escape from innate immune responses and establish infectious diseases, however knowledge of the mechanisms that enable type III machine assembly and functional transport of its effectors into immune cells is incomplete or lacking. This proposal's goal is to remedy the knowledge gap, revealing molecular mechanisms of assembly, substrate recognition and transport. Such knowledge can then be exploited to search for small molecule inhibitors that block the pathogenesis of microbes that rely on type III secretion systems to establish human infectious diseases.",Yersinia Type III Transport Of Yop Proteins Into Immune Cells,1998,2014,"Schneewind, Olaf ",University of Chicago,Chicago,IL,17,1,377,1553
5R01AI073785-05,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Vibrio cholerae is the causative agent of the severe diarrheal disease, cholera, that is endemic in much of Asia, Africa, and South America. The species is quite diverse, although only strains of the O1 or O139 serogroup cause epidemic disease. However, a significant amount of disease occurs globally in sporadic episodes and is caused by strains belonging to non-O1/non-O139 serogroups. Unlike pathogenic O1 and O139 strains, the vast majority of pathogenic non-O1/non-O139 strains do not carry the well characterized virulence factors for colonization (TCP) and toxin production (CT), and presumably cause disease by an unknown mechanism(s). Whole genome sequencing of a clinically isolated non-O1/non-O139 strain, AM-19226, has revealed the presence of open reading frames (ORFs) having significant similarity to genes encoding a Type Three Secretion System (TTSS). These ORFs appear to be conserved among a subset of non-O1/non-O139 strains, as well as pandemic strains of V. parahaemolyticus. Many pathogenic bacteria use TTSSs to translocate virulence factors into the cytosol of host cells, and we hypothesize that the presence of similar ORFs in V. cholerae represents a newly identified mechanism for host cell interaction and virulence acquired by these strains. Experiments suggest that the TTSS is indeed functional and has a role in pathogenesis. Deletion of a critical component of the TTSS severely attenuates the ability of strain AM-19226 to colonize the infant mouse model. Furthermore, an effector protein (whose secretion is TTSS dependent) has been identified, and it appears to have a role in the reorganization of host cell actin. We propose to use three complimentary in vitro approaches to begin to understand TTSS mediated pathogenesis in V. cholerae. The first approach is to identify additional effector proteins that promote virulence, using complimentary in vitro and in vivo model systems. The second approach is to dissect how effector proteins interact with host cells at the molecular level to cause disease, and the third is to use genomic approaches to begin to understand the regulatory network governing expression of the genes encoding effector proteins and the TTSS structural apparatus. Project Narrative: Today cholera is considered a health threat mainly in developing nations, regions lacking modern sanitation facilities, and in countries experiencing disrupted civil infrastructure due to war or environmental crises. The disease poses a threat to individuals traveling to endemic areas, and the United States CDC considers some strains a Category B level BioTerrorism threat because of the potential for spread via contaminated food or water. While O1 and O139 epidemic causing strains are well studied, this proposal seeks to understand the virulence mechanisms employed by strains of other serogroups that represent an emerging threat.",Pathogenic Mechanisms Of Non-01/non-0139 V.

Our long-term goal is to understand how pathogens breach the immune defenses at the human maternal-fetal interface, causing maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. We have focused on the human intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes (NIAID Category B Priority Pathogen), which causes pregnancy complications including spontaneous abortion, preterm labor, and neonatal disease. We have developed a novel pregnant guinea pig model of listeriosis that replicates human disease, as the placental architecture of guinea pigs closely resembles humans. We have examined the kinetics of placental infection in this model and found that the placenta is relatively protected from colonization. Our preliminary studies in primary human placental organ cultures corroborate these findings: we have evidence that L. monocytogenes is subjected to multiple bottlenecks when infecting the placenta. We found that the syncytiotrophoblast, which constitutes most of the placental surface and is bathed in maternal blood, was highly resistant to L. monocytogenes infection. The main portal of entry into the placenta was a small subpopulation of fetally derived cells (extravillous cytotrophoblasts), which anchor the placenta in the decidua, the lining of the pregnant uterus. Extravillous cytotrophoblasts are not readily accessible from the maternal blood stream, which provides a novel explanation why almost all placental pathogens have intracellular life cycles: they have to reach the decidua inside of maternal cells to spread to the placenta. We also have evidence that cytotrophoblasts are able to inhibit listerial growth and therefore most likely represent the next bottleneck L. monocytogenes has to overcome. We hypothesize that the placenta has evolved multiple mechanisms to resist infection. We propose to use primary human placental cell and organ cultures to characterize how L. monocytogenes breaches the maternal-fetal barrier and how cytotrophoblasts restrict listerial growth. We will test the importance of our findings in vivo in the pregnant guinea pig model of listeriosis. The specific aims are: (1) To determine the mechanisms utilized by L. monocytogenes to breach the maternal-fetal barrier. (2) To characterize infection of isolated primary placental cells with L. monocytogenes. (3) To characterize the transcriptional response of extravillous cytotrophoblasts to infection with L. monocytogenes.

5R01DE018142-05,National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research,97,"Botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT/A), a potent paralytic, is a widely used treatment for the masseter muscles. Clinical reports suggest that some effects of BoNT/A treatment (atrophy, reduced electrical activity) are unusually long-lasting in jaw muscles, but the reasons for this are not clear. Possible explanations are reduction in the number of motor units or a poor response of the satellite cell population, but as yet no animal studies have been performed to study the biology of jaw muscles after toxin treatment. In clinical usage, bite force recovers more rapidly than the masseter, but the mechanism for this is unknown. Additionally, one benefit claimed for BoNT/A but unproven is that the jaw will be unloaded after muscle paralysis. If so, then disuse loss of bone should result, but this too is undemonstrated. The proposed research is a systematic examination of the effects of BoNT/A on the masseter muscle and the mandible, using two accepted animal models of human masticatory function, rabbit and pig. Specific Aim 1 will use electromyography and motion analysis to clarify whether compensatory patterns of muscle usage account for the early return of bite force and masticatory ability. Specific Aim 2 will assess the possible unloading of the injection side mandible by strain gage recording and microCT examination of bony architecture. Masseter paralysis is hypothesized to be followed rapidly by loss of bone mass in unloaded regions. Specific Aim 3 will investigate whether BoNT/A paralysis causes reorganization of motor units within the masseter and will employ neurotracing and nerve stimulation techniques. The immediate response to the toxin is expected to be expansion of normally highly restricted motor unit territories. The possibility of motor neuron loss will also be investigated. Specific Aim 4 will establish the course of muscle degeneration and repair to explore why atrophy is long-lasting in the masseter. The activity of the satellite cell population will be described through markers of replication and cell death and by tracking changes in myosin heavy chain composition. In summary, this project addresses the biology underlying a common clinical treatment. It will provide new information on how the muscles and their nerves are affected, how jaw biomechanics are altered, and the extent of neuroplasticity of the jaw motor system. The results will provide an informed background for patient treatment and for interpreting outcomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Botulinum neurotoxin type A, better known under the commercial name of Botox, paralyzes muscles for extended periods of time, during which the muscles atrophy and the nerves reorganize.

These enteropathogens include  Shigella (including S. dysenteriae 1, a bioterror threat agent), enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) (the major  cause of traveler's diarrhea) and the emerging pathogens shiga toxin producing E. coli (STEC) (main cause  of hemolytic uremic syndrome, HUS) and enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) (recently recognized as an  important agent of pediatric diarrheal disease in the U.S.A). These enteropathogens are all Category B risk  agents of biodefense concern. A vaccine with broad coverage against this group would be beneficial to  multiple segments of the US population, including: 1) adult and child travelers who visit less developed  countries where these infections are hyperendemic; 2) children in certain areas high risk areas of the US; 3)  and for mass immunization in the face of deliberate bioterror spread most of these pathogens. Immunization  by the mucosal route is an effective method for induction of mucosal and systemic immune responses,  believed to be important in protection against these enteropathogens. Studies during the first MARGE  funding cycle revealed the ability of our live attenuated S. dysenteriae 1 vaccine strain expressing Stx1 B to  induce high titer Stx1 neutralizing antibodies in an animal model, in addition to S. dysenteriae 1 LPS specific  antibodies that are critical for protection against S dysenteriae 1 disease. The elicitation of antitoxin that  neutralizes Stx1 suggests the potential to confer protection against other Shiga toxin expressing pathogens  such as STEC. In this application we propose to extend the spectrum of coverage of our multivalent live  vector enteric vaccine by expressing protective antigens from STEC and EAEC. In a rational step-wise  manner, Shiga toxin B subunits from Stx1 and Stx2, a chimeric toxoid Stx2A1B, and the protective AAF/II  fimbrial antigen from EAEC will be engineered in attenuated derivatives of S. dysenteriae 1, and S. flexneri  serotypes 3a and 6 using a novel ssb-stabilized plasmid system, Optimal live vector-antigen configurations  will be evaluated for protection against STEC infection in a rabbit model or inhibition of cell binding and  biofilm formation by EAEC.

1R03AI097160-01A1,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Anesthetic administration is associated with a significantly increased risk of infection in hospital patients undergoing surgery. While several studies have reported linkages between commonly used anesthetics and decreased immune cell function, little is currently known regarding the molecular mechanisms by which drugs that target the nervous system influence host immune responses. An improved understanding of pathways of communication between the nervous and immune systems would clarify how specific anesthetics place individuals at greater risk for microbial infection. The facultative intracellular bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) has served for decades as a powerful model system for deciphering host responses to microbial infection, and the organism continues to serve as tool for elucidating new paradigms of innate and adaptive immunity. Based on the well-established mouse model of Lm infection, experiments outlined within this proposal will use Lm to elucidate the mechanisms by which commonly used surgical anesthetics, such as propofol, dramatically increase host susceptibility to microbial infection. Preliminary data indicates that intravenous administration of anesthetics to mice prior to Lm infection increased bacterial burdens in target organs by more than 10,000-fold in comparison to none drug-treated animals. Propofol, the most commonly used anesthetic in human surgeries, was found to reduce the clearance of bacteria from mouse target organs and to alter host innate immune signaling. The working hypothesis of this proposal is that propofol and possibly other anesthetic agents increase host susceptibility to microbial infection by enhancing bacterial translocation across host barriers while also impeding the recruitment of innate immune effector cells to sites of bacterial infection. Experiments in Aim 1 will examine the impact of anesthetic exposure on multiple facets of host immunity to Lm infection, including cytokine and chemokine signaling and monocyte recruitment to sites of bacterial infection. Aim 2 experiments will determine if propofol exposure has broad effects towards increasing host susceptibility to other microbial pathogens, specifically bacteria that occupy different intracellular and extracellular replication niches within the host. The outcome of these pilot studies will be a deeper understanding of how anesthetic agents suppress host immunity, and the data generated will form the basis for future collaborative projects designed to decipher the pathways that link the central nervous system with host immune function. This novel area of research has the potential to ultimately reduce the frequency and severity of post-surgical infections via the recognition of host immune responses negatively impacted by anesthetic exposure and by recognition of the types of infections for which anesthesia increases host susceptibility.&#9;           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Anesthetic administration is associated with significantly increased rates of infection in hospital patients undergoing surgery.

1R43ES022335-01,National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences,25,"The botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs; A-G), secreted by the anaerobic bacterium Clostridium botulinum, are highly lethal microbial proteins with an extremely low half-lethal dose of only 1-3 ng/kg in humans. In other words, one hundredth of a milligram (10 &#191;g) of the toxin could be extremely fatal to an adult; lower doses can result in partial muscle paralysis. Of the seven serotypes (A-G), only types A, B, E, and F are known to be pathogenic in humans. Owing to their high toxicity and to the ease of their production and potential dissemination into air, water, and food supply, the BoNTs are considered among the preeminent bioterrorism threats. As such, the NIAID and CDC have categorized them as Class A threat agents. The benchmark BoNT assay is based on an in vivo mouse lethality assay which can detect the BoNTs at very low levels (10 pg/mL). However, besides being viewed as inhumane and costly to run, the assay results are not available for 2-4 days. This is clearly untenable in a potential bioterrorism situation because, in order to implement suitable therapeutic and prophylactic measures in the event of an intentional release, it is critical that rapid and early diagnosis of neurotoxin intoxication in humans be possible. More pertinently, the assay is more suited for detecting environmental contamination of the toxin than for human biomonitoring. Routine laboratory diagnosis of botulinum intoxication is based on the detection of the neurotoxin in the patient. In vitro diagnostic immunoassays, such as ELISA, enzyme-linked coagulation assay, and IPCR (immunoPCR) methods have been developed for this. However, nearly all such methods are confounded by one or the other of the following requirements: 1) expensive and/or sensitive reagents (antibodies); that require stringent storage (e.g., refrigeration) and delicate assay conditions; 2) protracted assay time; 3) limited sensitiviy of detection; 4) bulky detection equipment (e.g., fluorescence or luminescence plate reader); and/or 5) trained personnel to execute assays. Assays that monitor functional proteolytic activity of the neurotoxins have also been developed, many of which are limited by similar constraints. Consequently, the utility of these for point-of-care diagnosis of BoNT intoxication in humans is limited. This Phase I proposal describes the development of highly robust, short peptide molecules with exquisite affinity for the BoNTs that can serve as antibody replacements in field- deployable diagnostics. The novel discovery approach will find broad impact for designing short peptide affinity reagents to multiple other proteinaceous biothreat agents, including shiga and shiga-like toxins, Staphylococcus and Clostridium enterotoxins, abrin, and ricin. Long term, we envisage the incorporation of short, high-affinity peptides into a highly-sensitive, label-free, multiplexed electrical detection platform, premised on silicon nanowire field-effect transistors, suitable for the generation of low cost, low power, easy-to- use handheld devices for rapid monitoring and detection of toxins produced by pathogenic organisms in humans.

Such a capability will enable prompt treatment and/or preventative strategies to be instituted expeditiously for maximum public health benefit.

4R37AI039031-17,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Inflammatory monocytes are essential for Innate immune defense against bacterial, fungal, protozoal and viral pathogens. To be effective, monocytes must be recruited from the bone marrow to sites of infection. The mechanisms tiiat drive monocyte recruitment, however, are poorly understood and are the focus of our proposed studies. Our laboratory has demonstrated that the CCR2 chemokine receptor and its ligands MCP1 and MCP3 are required for monocyte emigration from the bone marrow during Listeria monocytogenes infection. How infection in the spleen and liver induces monocyte emigration from the bone marrow, however, remains mysterious. The goal ofthe proposed studies is to determine how infections and circulating microbial molecules promote monocyte emigration from the bone marrow into the bloodstream.

These studies will use a recentiy generated MCPl reporter mouse strain and a mouse strain in which MCP1 can be conditionally deleted. Our proposed experiments will determine whether specific deletion of MCPl in these cell populations impairs monocyte trafficking. The second specific aim is to investigate in vivo MCP3 production in bone marrow and peripheral tissues and determine its role in monocyte recruitment. We will generate a conditional MCP3 knockout/reporter mouse strain to determine which cells in bone marrow and peripheraltissuesorchestrate monocyte migration by expressing MCP3.

The research of the effects of chronic exposure to iAs has commonly focused on its carcinogenic potency. However, epidemiologic studies indicate that iAs exerts other adverse effects that do not involve cancer. Several studies in arseniasis-endemic areas of Taiwan, Bangladesh, and Mexico have linked chronic exposures to high or moderate levels of iAs in drinking water to an increased risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). Although results of epidemiologic studies in low-exposure areas or occupational settings have been inconclusive, laboratory research shows that exposures to iAs can produce symptoms that are consistent with T2D. In our preliminary studies, mice chronically exposed to iAs in drinking water developed impaired glucose tolerance. The major fraction of arsenic retained in tissues of these mice, including liver, pancreas, adipose and skeletal muscle tissues, was represented by methylated arsenicals, the products of the methylation of iAs by arsenic (3+ oxidation state) methyltransferase (AS3MT). Our in vitro studies showed that methylated trivalent arsenicals are more potent than iAs as inhibitors of insulin signaling and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in cultured adipocytes. Notably, concentrations of arsenicals that inhibit glucose uptake by adipocytes and arsenic concentrations in tissues of mice that developed impaired glucose tolerance after exposure to iAs in drinking water are similar to arsenic concentrations in livers of residents in the arseniasis areas of Bangladesh. These results suggest that the formation of methylated trivalent arsenicals in the course of iAs metabolism may be a determining factor for development of T2D in individuals exposed to iAs in drinking water and that insulin-activated signal transduction pathway is the key target for these arsenicals. Based on these findings, we propose a translational research project that will examine diabetogenic effects of iAs in cultured cells, laboratory mice, and in humans. The main goals of this project are (i) to further characterize the association between iAs exposure and T2D, (ii) to identify molecular mechanisms for the diabetogenic effects of iAs exposure, (iii) to evaluate the roles specific metabolites of iAs play in these effects, and (iv) to characterize AS3MT polymorphisms that are associated with the increased production of these metabolites.

5U54AI057168-09,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Hypothesis: Leptin is an important regulator of the intestinal inflammatory response to infection, and does so  through its effects on either hematopoietic or non-hematopoietic cells of the gut.  Leptin and leptin receptor are expressed in the intestinal epithelium and in infiltrating mononuclear cells in  the lamina propria. Leptin controls expression of epithelial sodium/glucose and peptide transporters,  regulates apoptosis, and induces intestinal inflammation via T lymphocytes. We and others have observed  that mice deficient in leptin (ob/ob) or functional leptin receptor (db/db) have altered susceptibility to  amebiasis and Clostridium difficile, as well as experimentally-induced inflammatory bowel disease. These  results suggest that leptin may have broad regulatory roles in enteric infection and inflammation. Intriguingly,  a common (present in one half of the CephUtah population analyzed by HapMap) single amino acid  polymorphismm in the leptin receptor (that alters its affinity for leptin) is associated with resistance in children  to amebiasis, and in adults to amebic liver abscess. We propose to study the mechanisms by which leptin  and its receptor regulate intestinal defense against infection in mice and in humans. First we will test how  general the observation is of the link of leptin to intestinal infection and inflammation. With collaborating  investigators within MARGE we will determine if ob/ob (leptin deficient) and db/db (leptin receptor deficient)  mice have increased susceptibility to infection and inflammation due to Giardia lamblia, Cryptospordium  pan/urn, enteroaggregative E. coli and C. difficile. We will then determine the contribution to infection and  inflammation of leptin and leptin receptor in intestinal epithelium vs. bone marrow-derived cells for a single  infectious agent, and its dependency upon STATS signaling.

An inverse relationship exists between expression levels of the secreted cysteine protease, SpeB, and severity of disease [1-3]. The so-called stand-alone regulator Rgg (also known as RopB) is required, but is not sufficient, for expression of SpeB. An unknown growth-phase-dependent factor is additionally required, but has remained elusive [4-6]. Our preliminary data demonstrate that the unknown factor is a bacterially-produced pheromone with properties consistent with a small peptide.  Additionally, analysis predicts that Rgg is a peptide-binding transcription factor with structural homology to PlcR and PrgX of other quorum sensing systems. The overall hypothesis to be tested is that a pheromone modulates the activity of Rgg for the purpose of controlling speB transcription. This is a departure from the paradigm that the Rgg-dependent pathway responds to environmental changes; instead, we provide compelling evidence that GAS produces its own impetus to induce speB. Our preliminary results demonstrate that Rgg paralogs found in GAS are indeed responsive to small peptide pheromones, providing a convincing precedent for our hypothesis and are the first examples that Rgg proteins are quorum sensing effectors. The goal of our research will be to define the signaling pheromone(s) present in culture supernatants and characterize the mechanism for its production and recognition by GAS. Genetic disruption of these systems will be tested for their contributions in localized and invasive infection models.

5R01AI076457-04,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"ABSTRACT The factors essential to induction of a protective immune response to bacterial infections are incompletely understood. In the case of Listeria monocytogenes (LM) infection, a category B Priority Pathogen, CD8 T cells are important in effecting sterilizing immunity. LM interfaces at multiple levels with vaccinology as well as the Biodefense initiative due to the significant potential of LM as a vaccine candidate but also as an agent for intentional contamination and generation of highly virulent recombinant strains. Our work has begun to examine the parameters required for effective immunization with killed or mutant LM as potential vaccine vehicles. Specifically, immunization with heat killed LM (HKL) or irradiated LM (IRL) induced distinct patterns of T cell activation characterized by much more robust CD8 T cell memory induction following vaccination with IRL. However, IRL immunization did not induce the level of T cell activation and memory induction obtained with live LM infection. Thus, this is an excellent system for delineation of the mechanisms involved in promotion of distinct degrees of CD8 T cell activation generated by distinct forms of the same pathogen. Based on our preliminary data, the newly proposed studies focus on integrating the anatomy of effective CD8 T cell immune response initiation and memory T cell reactivation with the costimulatory and genetic programming necessary to drive a protective immune response. The hypothesis that responses induced by live infection versus immunization with attenuated vaccines share common essential components to generate protective memory will be tested in three aims: Specific Aim 1. To determine the role of costimulation and CD4 T cell help in priming and protective recall responses following LM infection or vaccination. Specific Aim 2.

Determining the trigger is limited, however, to known causes of anaphylaxis. Therefore, identification of novel causative agents will provide an important step forward by reducing risk of disease and facilitating new, specific treatment approaches. The overarching hypothesis for this proposal is that IgE antibodies to carbohydrates are a major factor in anaphylaxis that currently appears to be idiopathic. We have recently identified and described a carbohydrate, alpha-gal, as a novel food allergen. Patients who have IgE antibodies to alpha-gal report delayed anaphylaxis or urticaria occurring 3-6 hours after eating beef, pork or lamb. The significance of investigating these reactions comes not only from the obvious importance of understanding a novel life threatening form of food allergy, but also because of the possibility of defining a totally new mechanism for reactions related to an important food substance. Our plan of research will investigate the relationship of IgE antibodies to alpha-gal with anaphylaxis and determine whether these antibodies are specific for the carbohydrate alpha-gal. A delay of 3-6 hours is most unusual in patients with classical food allergy and warrants investigation of the mechanism(s) involved. Using histamine release and basophil activation studies, we will determine whether IgE to alpha-gal can be functionally activated in these cells. Following the completion of the mechanistic studies, we will perform double-blind, placebo controlled food challenges to further understand the delayed appearance of clinical symptoms after eating mammalian meat. Most patients who have IgE to alpha-gal tolerated mammalian meat for many years prior to the onset of symptoms. Interestingly, greater than 90% of patients in our cohort who have IgE to alpha-gal report being bitten by large numbers of adult or larval ticks ('seed ticks') in the weeks or months prior to developing symptoms. Using dendritic cell (DC) and T cell co-culture, we will test the hypothesis that a specific receptor, that of the type II C-type lectin receptor, is critical to the initiation of a TH2 response to the tick antigen. Our current work has shown that IgE to the carbohydrate alpha-gal is present in a cohort of patients who report delayed anaphylaxis and allergic reactions after eating mammalian meat. We believe that IgE to alpha-gal and other carbohydrates represents a novel cause of food allergy. The specific aims outlined in this proposal are designed to establish the specificity of this carbohydrate-directed IgE (Specific Aim #1), elucidate the functional role of this IgE in food allergy (Specific Aim #2) and elucidate the mechanism for induction of TH2 responses which govern IgE antibody production to this moiety (Specific Aim #3). Anaphylaxis, or shock, is a severe allergic reaction that can progress quickly and may be fatal if appropriate medical action is not taken. We have identified a group of patients in the Southeastern U.S. who develop delayed anaphylaxis 3-6 hours after eating beef, pork or lamb and appear to be allergic to a sugar on red meat. Because of the delay, their symptoms would normally be regarded as 'spontaneous' or 'of unknown cause' but understanding why the delay occurs and why adult patients in the Southeast are suddenly becoming allergic to red meat may provide real insight into the factors that control anaphylaxis and food allergy.",IgE To Carbohydrates Causes Delayed Anaphylaxis,2010,2015,"Commins, Scott Palmer",University of Virginia,Charlottesville,VA,55,1,1,4882

Highly sensitive and specific in vitro methods that are efficient and easy to use to identify relevant food, drug, and/or aero allergens are lacking. Our group has recently developed comprehensive flow cytometry-based protocols for the analysis of surface markers in basophil populations in small amounts of human whole blood. We propose to use the basophils contained in whole blood to assess the presence of drug, aero, and/or food allergy. The assay could potentially have a long term, powerful impact to diagnose and follow subjects with food, drug, and/or aeroallergen allergy.  Our approach will include using small amounts of whole blood samples from well characterized controls and from drug, aeroallergen, and food allergic subjects who are well characterized and who we have already been challenged with drug, aeroallergen and/or food in the Stanford Hospitals and Clinics to document their allergen reactivity. We hypothesize that our innovative exploratory whole blood assay in which basophils are characterized by measuring their expression of extracellular antigens, like CD203c and CD63, represents a potentially better approach for the assessment and clinical monitoring of drug, aeroallergen and food allergy. Specifically, our overall aim includes: to determine whether the presence of an allergy can be revealed by our novel assay using small amounts of whole blood to measure basophil activation stimulated by ex vivo challenge with purified candidate allergens for 20 minutes.

Typhi), the cause of typhoid fever in humans, continues to be a very significant health problem. It is estimated that there are 16,000,000 cases of typhoid fever every year, resulting in 600,000 deaths. Although most of the cases occur in developing countries, outbreaks occasionally occur in the United States. Unlike other Salmonella enterica serovars, which can infect a variety of hosts, S. Typhi is an exclusive human pathogen. The molecular bases for the host adaptation and unique pathogenicity of these bacteria are poorly understood. However, it is believed that a combination of genome degradation and acquisition of new genetic information has conferred on S. Typhi its unique pathogenic properties. Work in our laboratory has recently focused on a pathogenicity islet that is unique to S. Typhi. We have discovered that this region of the chromosome encodes a Cytolethal Distending Toxin, and a Pertussis-like toxin. Remarkably, these toxins are only synthesized when S. Typhi reaches an intracellular location and are exported outside the cell by a unique transport mechanism to be subsequently delivered to target cells by novel paracrine and autocrine pathways. Furthermore, we have found that these toxins share a common unique secretion mechanism for export from the bacterial cytoplasm. In this research project, we intend to characterize this unique toxin delivery pathway and their unique secretion mechanism. We also would like to define their contribution to virulence in the context of S. Typhi pathogenesis and its interaction with host cells. These studies will provide insight into unique and important mechanisms of pathogenicity of S. Typhi, a surprisingly under study but very important human pathogen.

The long- term objectives of this project are to understand the pathogenesis of disease due to this organism. Previous work on this project has resulted in the discovery of a 35 kb pathogenicity island called the Locus of Enterocyte Effacement (LEE) that is responsible for the attaching and effacing (AE) histopathology on intestinal epithelial cells that is the hallmark of EPEC infections. The LEE island encodes the epithelial cell adhesin named intimin, a type III protein secretion system, and several effector proteins that are translocated into epithelial cells to mediate the AE lesion. Typical EPEC strains possess the LEE plus the EAF plasmid that encodes a type IV pilus (BFP) that contributes to epithelial cell adherence and a positive regulator of EPEC virulence factors called Per. Typical EPEC strains are an important cause of infant diarrhea in developing countries but are infrequent causes of disease in the U.S. Atypical EPEC strains contain the LEE but lack the EAF plasmid. In contrast to typical EPEC strains, atypical EPEC appear to cause outbreaks and sporadic disease in adults in industrialized countries such as the U.S., Finland, and Japan. Recent studies of atypical EPEC in children with diarrhea in the U.S. suggest that the incidence of infections with this pathogen may equal or exceed that of Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, or E. coil O157:H7.  The proposed research goals for the next period of support include continued characterization of pathogenic mechanisms of typical EPEC strains, particularly genes encoded outside the LEE, and a new focus on potential pathogenic mechanisms of atypical EPEC.

PCB concentrations are measured through repeated air sampling inside and outside of homes and local schools. Blood samples are collected annually and assayed for PCB congeners. These data are compared to a rural site to characterize high and low exposure residential cohorts. The urban site (East Chicago, IN) has a legacy of PCB contamination from intense past industrial activity whereas the rural site (Columbus Junction, IA) is without local sources of PCBs. The project will continue four original aims and pursue two new aims: Aim 1. Establish a residential cohort in East Chicago and a rural residential cohort in Columbus Junction; Aim 2. Measure emissions and exposures of atmospheric PCBs at homes and schools in these communities; Aim 3. Gather demographic, residential, occupational, activity and dietary information by questionnaire; Aim 4.

2R56AI067699-07A1,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"The central objective of this proposal is to identify the design principles by which gene clusters encoding complex molecular machines are organized and regulated. As a model system, we will study the type III secretion system (T3SS) encoded in Salmonella Pathogenicity Island 1 (SPI-1). The T3SS is a molecular machine that acts a syringe to inject proteins into host cells. The T3SS requires the expression of ~18 proteins at the correct ratios to properly assemble and function. Little is known as to how changes in the relative expression levels, the order of expression, and expression noise impact this process. We propose to study SPI-1 by rebuilding it from the bottom-up, using biophysical models and well-characterized genetic parts. This process, known as refactoring, replaces all of the regulation with synthetic variants and eliminates unknown and poorly characterized regulation. The refactored SPI-1 is controlled by synthetic genetic circuits that implement the dynamics of gene expression. In Aim 1, the refactored system will be used as a platform to determine how gene order and translational coupling impact the robustness of the cluster to perturbations in expression levels. In Aim 2, the impact of different regulatory programs on the proper assembly and function of the T3SS will be determined. Synthetic genetic circuits will be constructed that implement different feed forward and feedback loops that are predicted by mathematical models to affect the noise and dynamics of gene expression. This enables the testing of hypotheses that controlling the temporal order and intrinsic noise of expression is important for the assembly of macromolecular complexes.

Recently, the CDC and colleagues reported that MRSA are the most significant causes of serious infections and infectious disease deaths in the United States. A major factor involved in the lethality of MRSA and MSSA are secreted toxins, known as super antigens. The lethality associated with these super antigens has been appreciated for decades, as the U.S. military stockpiled large amounts of staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) under its old bioweapons program that was terminated in 1969. The mechanism of action of the toxins is well known - they act extracellularly by binding to the T cell receptor on T cells and stimulating massive release of inflammatory cytokines. We have engineered soluble T cell receptors for high-affinity binding to super antigens to prevent toxin-associated lethality. The objective of this proposal is to build on the success of work completed in Phase I where treatment with the novel therapeutic (soluble, high-affinity T cell receptor, called IMV-01) was able to neutralize SEB secreted from MRSA in an intrapulmonary rabbit model. The hypotheses of the Phase II work are that yields of the therapeutics can be improved, that IMV-01 and two soluble T cell receptor leads (IMV-02 and IMV-03) already engineered against the other clinically important super antigens (SEC & TSST-1) can be co-administered as a cocktail to neutralize these toxins, and prevent lethality due to pneumonia caused by MRSA. The Specific Aims are: 1) To determine the best conditions for optimizing the yield and purity of the V?-TCRs IMV-01, IMV-02 and IMV-03; 2) To determine the effective dose and timing of IMV-01, IMV-02 or IMV-03 individually to neutralize their respective toxins produced by MRSA strains in an intrapulmonary rabbit model in the presence or absence of vancomycin; and 3) To determine the efficacy of using IMV-01, IMV-02 and IMV- 03 as a cocktail to protect rabbits from death due to intrapulmonary challenge with three different MRSA strains secreting either SEB + SEC, SEB + TSST-1 or SEC + TSST-1, in the presence or absence of vancomycin.

Heralded as the stomach flu, retirement community outbreaks are pervasive and can result in 1-2% mortality rates in the elderly. Based on capsid sequences norovirus are divided into 5 genogroups. Genogroup I (GI) and II (GII) account for almost all human infections. Each genogroup is further divided into genotypes. The GII.4 genotype is the causative agent of 70-80% of all norovirus outbreaks worldwide. The norovirus major capsid protein forms an icosohedral shell, contains major antigenic determinants and interacts with histoblood group antigen (HBGA) carbohydrates, putative receptors for entry. This study investigates the molecular mechanisms governing norovirus capsid evolution, structure and HBGA recognition as a function of immune driven antigenic drift and deceptive imprinting. We identify the mechanisms by which replacement strains evolve over time, recognize new HBGA carbohydrate binding targets, and escape from highly penetrent host susceptibility alleles and protective herd immunity. While defining the relationships between mutation, antigenic variation, immunogenicity, deceptive imprinting, structure and HGBA binding, our interdisciplinary team simultaneously develops a robust GII.4 challenge model in swine and characterizes human monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to GI and GII strains, providing key reagents for advancing the field.

It is well known that certain viral infections can facilitate secondary bacterial infections. However, the role that bacteria play in facilitating other bacterial infections is not well studied. We have determined that Salmonella encodes a LuxR homolog named SdiA that can detect the signaling molecules of other pathogenic bacteria in the host. To date, we have determined that Salmonella can detect Aeromonas hydrophila in turtles and Yersinia enterocolitica in mice and pigs. The ability of Salmonella to detect the signaling molecules of Yersinia in pigs led to a large increase in Salmonella shedding. In a separate study it was recently observed that swine infected with Yersinia enterocolitica are at increased risk to be colonized with Salmonella enterica. Given that Salmonella is one of the world's most significant pathogens, it is important to determine the parameters that lead to transmission of this organism. In this work, the extent to which a Yersinia infection increases the ability of Salmonella to colonize a host and be shed from that host will be determined. We will test the hypotheses that the infectious dose for Salmonella, the amount of Salmonella shed, and the persistence of Salmonella shedding are altered in a manner dependent upon the ability of Salmonella to detect the AHLs synthesized by Yersinia. The role of individual sdiA regulon members in each of these phenotypes will be determined. Additionally, array-based transposon screening will be used to identify novel Salmonella genes required to take advantage of coinfections. These genes will be parsed into sdiA- dependent and -independent groups, with the sdiA-dependent group being further categorized as to whether they are new members of the sdiA regulon or genes that act synergistically with sdiA.

In contrast, how abnormal forms of the prion protein (PrP) kill nerve cells is still a mystery. There is evidence that the neurotoxicity of prions lies in their ability to alter or subvert a normal, physiological function of PrPC, the cellular form of PrP, but the details of this process are obscure. Tg(?CR) mice, which express a mutant PrP deleted for residues 105-125, provide powerful insights into prion related pathogenic mechanisms. These animals spontaneously develop a severe neurodegenerative illness that is reversed in a dose-dependent fashion by co-expression of wild-type PrP. We have been interested in elucidating the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the powerful toxicity of PrP?CR. We have recently discovered that the ?CR deletion acts as a dominant, gain-of-function mutation that strongly activates an ion channel activity that is intrinsic to, or is indirectly induced by, PrP. Moreover, we have found that disease-associated point mutations in the central region of PrP have a similar effect, suggesting that some familial prion diseases are due to excitotoxic activation of ion channels. In this application, we propose to critically test an ion channel hypothesis of prion diseases. First, we will survey all known human mutations in the central region of PrP for their effect on ion channel activity in vitro. We will then undertake characterization of the biophysical properties of the channels induced by PrP molecules carrying point and deletion mutations in the central region. Finally, we will determine if excitotoxic activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors plays a role in the neuronal death and neuropathology induced by mutant PrP molecules and infectious PrPSc. The pathogenic mechanisms elucidated in this project are likely to have wide applicability, since abnormal activation of ion channels is a well established paradigm in a number of other neurodegenerative diseases and animal models. Moreover, identification of specific ion channel targets for PrP-mediated toxicity would represent the first step in development of an entirely new class of anti-prion drugs that inhibit cellular neurotoxic pathways, rather than PrPSc propagation.

However, currently, there is no effective, specific therapy for AIDS- associated cryptosporidiosis. The long term goal of this project is to develop therapeutics for cryptosporidiosis in AIDS patients by targeting enzymes that synthesize O-glycans that are integral to the ability of the parasite to attach to and invade intestinal epithelial cells. Our previous and preliminary studies strongly suggest that O- glycans play a significant role in mediating infection and inducing immune responses and imply that the enzymes (UDP-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine: polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyl transferases or ppGalNAc-Ts) which synthesize them may serve as targets for intervention for cryptosporidiosis in the immunocompromised, particularly AIDS patients. However, very little, if anything is known about these enzymes in Crypto. Our central hypothesis is that ppGalNAc-Ts that catalyze the synthesis of O-glycans on key mucin-type glycoproteins are essential for Crypto infection. The specific aim is to elucidate the functional role of ppGalNAc-Ts in Crypto infection using inhibitor identified by high throughput screening (HTS) of small molecule libraries in collaboration with National Small Molecule Screening and Medicinal Chemistry (NSRB) Core at the New the England Regional Center of Excellence for Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Diseases (NERCE-BEID). The most potent inhibitors of enzyme activity will be screened for their ability to specifically block synthesis of Crypto O-glycans.

These studies will establish the role of O-glycans and the enzymes that catalyze their synthesis in Crypto-host cell interactions and significantly advance the field.

In preliminary studies, we show that the cytokine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) has important non redundant activity in vivo in influencing DC and DC- epithelial cell communication, and governs the character and outcome of the host response to infection with C. rodentium. This led to our hypothesis that GM-CSF has novel activities on DC and epithelial cells in the infected intestinal mucosa that go beyond its previously recognized functions, and determine the outcome of enteric infection. Therefore, an overarching, but not exclusive, goal of the proposed studies includes defining mechanisms by which GM-CSF governs DC and epithelial cell innate responses to enteric pathogens. We will use gene targeted mouse models with in vivo and ex-vivo approaches to address three Specific Aims. Aim 1 will determine mechanisms by which GM-CSF mediates host innate protection to a model A/E pathogen in vivo. Aim 2 will characterize the pathways by which GM-CSF activates production of CCL22, an epithelial cell-produced mediator that is important for GM-CSF-induced DC recruitment and mucosal localization. Aim 3 will determine mechanisms by which DC, epithelial cells and GM-CSF orchestrate host innate immunity and mucosal protection to small intestinal infection in vivo. We will benefit immensely from our collaborations and close interactions with Drs. Eckmann, Raz and Cheroutre by combining our model systems for studies downstream of DC activation, which define mechanisms that link innate and acquired immunity. Our studies require extensive use of the Mouse Model Core, the Histopathology Core (Core B) for tissue processing and immunohistochemistry, and the Imaging and Cell Sorting Core (Core C) for state of the art studies using confocal spectral deconvolution microscopy and live imaging 2-photon microscopy. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Intestinal infections result in extensive morbidity and millions of deaths worldwide each year. Among enteric infections, human A/E pathogens [EPEC and EHEC (the hamburger bacillus)] and Rotavirus (-800,000 deaths per year) rank among the most frequent causes of dian'heal illness and death. We will determine how the host's innate immune system helps to defend against those infections. We anticipate new infonnation obtained will lead to important and novel approaches for preventing and treating intestinal infections and new insights into the causation of post infectious inflammatory diseases in the intestinal tract.",Regulation Of Innate Immunity To Enteric Infection,,,"Kagnoff, Martin Frederick",University of California San Diego,La Jolla,CA,6,1,-1,501
2P42ES010349-11,National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences,25,"PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):  The carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic mechanisms of As are incompletely understood, but an emerging body of evidence suggests that As exposure leads to epigenetic dysregulation. In 4 independent studies in our Bangladesh cohort we have demonstrated that chronic As exposure is associated with increased global DNA methylation, contingent on adequate folate status. We hypothesize that the mechanism underlying this relates to As-induced alterations in histone modifications. Two potential mechanisms include a) in vitro, As induces G9a mRNA and protein expression; G9a is a central player in epigenetic regulation, and b) As is a very potent inhibitor of pyruvate dehydrogenase, an enzyme that catalyzes the final step in Acetyl CoA biosynthesis; inhibition of Acetyl CoA biosynthesis may decrease histone acetylation leading to chromatin  condensation and increased DNA methylation.  Folate is a key regulator of one-carbon metabolism mediated methylation reactions, including methylation of DNA and histones. A large randomized trial is currently underway in Bangladesh to evaluate the effects of folic acid (FA) supplementation on As methylation. We propose a cross-disciplinary collaboration that will take advantage of a unique repository of samples collected from this trial to carry out a set of aims related to nutrition/environment interactions. In these aims, we will characterize the influence of As exposure on histone modifications, relate changes in histone modifications to changes in DNA methylation, and characterize the impact of FA supplementation on these marks. Finally, using the Intinium Human Methylation450 array, we will identify a set of genes that are differentially methylated by As exposure and determine gene-specific histone modifications at these loci. Collectively, these aims will begin to elucidate the molecular events that underlie the effects of As and folate on DNA methylation. The implications of identifying an influence of FA supplementation on histone modifications are considerable, as this represents a simple, low-cost, low-risk intervention as a potential therapeutic approach to reverse As-induced epigenetic  dysregulation.",Project 3: Impact Of Nutrition On Arsenic-Induced Epignetic Dysregulation,,,"Graziano, Joseph H",Columbia University Health Sciences,New York,NY,37,1,-1,-1
5R01AI052148-09,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Bacteria of the genus Yersinia are responsible for a variety of human diseases. Y. pestis causes the infamous disease Plague, which has regained prominence in public awareness due to its potential use as an agent of bioterrorism. In contrast, Y. pseudotuberculosis and Y. enterocolitica cause primarily gastrointestinal disease. However, despite the differences in disease symptoms, these three pathogenic Yersinia species are closely related, and share several common virulence determinants. Yersinia studies have provided fundamental insights into bacterial pathogenesis, including the first example of the widespread type three secretion system (T3SS). A critical component of all T3SSs is a specialized outer membrane pore-forming protein known as a secretin. However, secretin production can cause bacterial cell envelope stress. This is lethal to Y. enterocolitica unless a critical stress response known as the phage-shock-protein (Psp) system is functional. As a result, the Psp system of Y. enterocolitica is essential for its virulence. Our studies on the Psp system to date have identified its core components and begun to define their roles. We will base our future work on the hypotheses that regulation of the Y. enterocolitica Psp system is mediated by complex and dynamic protein- protein interactions, and that the activated system functions to counter problems associated with the cytoplasmic membrane, such as can be caused by a mislocalized secretin. To address these hypotheses we propose to: (1) Test various models of how the PspFABC proteins may constitute a signal transduction system that regulates psp gene expression via dynamic protein-protein interactions; (2) Analyze the regulatory and physiological functions of the PspB and PspC proteins, which play multiple essential roles in the system; (3) Directly analyze the connections between secretin toxicity, secretin mislocalization to the cytoplasmic membrane, and the function of the Psp system in Y. enterocolitica. These studies also have broad significance beyond Y. enterocolitica because secretin-containing systems critical for virulence, and the Psp system, are widespread in medically important bacteria. Therefore, by understanding the Psp system we will gain further insight into the essential ability of bacteria to respond to stressful conditions that occur during host infection. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The bacterium Yersinia enterocolitica causes human gastroenteritis, and is closely related to the causative agent of Plague, Y. pestis. The proposed research will increase our understanding of a stress-response system in Y. enterocolitica that is essential for its ability to cause disease, and is also present in numerous other medically important bacteria. Understanding this stress-response system is vital, because in the long-term it could be a target for the design of new therapeutic strategies against Yersinia species as well as other disease- causing bacteria.",The Psp Response Of Yersinia Enterocolitica,2002,2014,"Darwin, Andrew J.",New York University School of Medicine,New York,NY,37,1,-1,-1
7R01AI089808-03,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"The Apicomplexa comprise a medically important phylum of obligate intracellular parasites, including Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria, Cryptosporidium, which causes gastrointestinal disease, and the category B agent Toxoplasma gondii, which can be pathogenic in immunocompromised hosts and the developing fetus. Drug therapies that effectively treat all stages of some of these parasites are currently lacking and in many cases existing drugs are quickly becoming ineffective due to the emergence of drug-resistant parasite strains. Thus, the discovery of new targets for drug design and the understanding of resistance mechanisms are high priorities in the studies of apicomplexan parasites. Our approach to this challenge has been to isolate and characterize T. gondii mutants that are resistant to specific anti- parasitic drugs. We have recently discovered that disruption of a mitochondrial MutS homologue (MSH), TgMSH-1, directly confers multi-drug resistance in T. gondii. MSHs are critical components of the eukaryotic DNA mismatch repair machinery and are also involved in signaling cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to DNA damaging agents. Interestingly, we have observed that certain anti-parasitic drugs cause disruption in the expression of cell cycle markers in a TgMSH1 dependent manner. Thus, we have identified a novel pathway in T. gondii, that when induced by certain drugs leads to parasite death. It is our hypothesis that that certain drugs affect the mitochondrion of the parasite directly or indirectly and that this effect results in the activation of a signaling pathway, which includes TgMSH1 and results in parasite death. It is our goal to dissect this TgMSH1 dependent death mechanism as to characterize a novel mode of killing apicomplexan parasites. Using a combination of cell biology, biochemistry and genomic approaches we will determine the effect of TgMSH1-dependent drugs on mitochondrial function, identify signaling partners of TgMHS1 and determine the effect of TgMSH1 dependent drugs on cell cycle. The completion of these aims will elucidate the details and mechanisms of an inducible death pathway. This constitutes an innovative approach to the discovery of drug targets in this important pathogen.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Toxoplasma gondii is a common parasitic infection in humans. Drugs against this parasite are limited and can often cause severe side effects. Thus, new drugs against Toxoplasma are critically needed. We have discovered a mechanism by which the parasite can be induced to die.

2R01HL013423-39A1,"National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute",98,"Group A streptococci (GAS) are highly specific human pathogens. Their efficient colonization and dissemination within the host lead to a spectrum of local and invasive infections, as well as infectious sequel, e.g., rheumatic heart disease, streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, and necrotic fasciitis. GAS surface M and M-like proteins are critical virulence factors of these organisms, and function through various mechanisms to allow effective infectivity in the host. One important such mechanism depends on the activation of the host fibrinolytic system by these bacteria, and M (e.g., M1) and M-like (e.g., PAM) proteins are essential for this function in large part through their ability to bind to host human plasminogen (hPg) directly (PAM), or, indirectly (M1), via fibrinogen (Fg)/fibrin (Fn). Through this overal mechanism, M and M-like proteins enhance the activation of Pg to the serine protease, plasmin (Pm), by bacterial or host Pg activators, thus creating a proteolytic bacterial microenvironment employed by GAS to catalyze degradation of fibrin, the extracellular matrix, and/or connective tissue, which then assists the spread of the bacteria. We will employ structural biochemistry, as well as bacterial and mammalian genetics, to understand the in vitro and in vivo mechanistic relationships between GAS proteins that mediate its virulence via the host fibrinolytic system, and their reliance on specific proteins of this system. Specifically, we propose three aims:  1. To study the relationships between structural domains within a M-like protein (PAM, from GAS strain AP53) and an M protein (M1, from GAS strain SF370) in their in vitro functioning using structural biochemical tools. Emphasis will be placed on establishing the correspondence between 1o and 2o structures in these proteins with hPg and/or Fg binding and activation of hPg by bacterial streptokinase (SK) and host activators.  2. To design and study variant AP53 strains with altered expression of PAM and SK in order to change the mechanism of assimilation of Pm on GAS, or to render GAS deficient in its capacity to activate hPg. The virulence of these mutated GAS strains, in a murine invasive skin infection model, will be examined in mice with investigator imposed genetic alterations in the fibrinolytic system.  3. To employ a continual venous catheterization infusion method to administer hPg and mutants of hPg into Pg-/- mice to examine the roles of individual domains of hPg in its activation to Pm in GAS, and the roles of these variant Pgs in promoting AP53 virulence.  The overall goal of this work is to mechanistically assess interactions of the bacteria and the host in activation of the fibrinolytic system, and their relationships to GAS pathogenicity. This will allow the establishment of new paradigms for treatment of diseases associated with these infections.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Group A streptococcal (GAS) infections affect >700M people annually worldwide, with ~18M of these considered severe, and another ~600K of invasive types with a fatality rate of ~30%. There are more than 200 strains of GAS that have been identified. Among the important GAS virulence mechanisms is their ability to subvert the host fibrinolytic system to benefit the dissemination of the bacteria by dissolving the fibrin matrix that encapsulates the bacteria. Also, activation of the fibrinolytic system potentially results in a cascade of matrix metalloproteinase activations, thus assisting bacterial metastasis into deep tissues, causing life-threatening infections. We will study the mechanisms by which this occurs to potentially allow new strategies to be used to attenuate this group of morbid and oftentimes fatal diseases.",Plasminogen And Plasmin:  Structure And Function,1975,2015,"Castellino, Francis J",University of Notre Dame,Notre Dame,IN,18,1,1405,-1
4R00ES018885-03,National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences,25,"Recent studies demonstrate that nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) plays a critical cytoprotective role in countering oxidative and electrophilic cellular stresses. Nrf2 is activated by a variety of chemicals, including environmental contaminants such as arsenic, cadmium, nickel, cigarette smoke, and diesel exhaust, as well as industrial byproducts, such as tetrafluoroethylcysteine. In addition, several widely used food preservatives also strongly activate Nrf2. Thus, Nrf2 activators are widely disseminated in the environment and in our food. Several papers have recently been published describing the suppressive effects of Nrf2 in innate immunity. In addition, the development of lupus-like pathology in Nrf2-null mice suggests that Nrf2 also plays an important role in adaptive immunity, but no studies examining the role of Nrf2 in lymphocytes have been published to date. Our preliminary data demonstrate that activated Nrf2 inhibits IFN gamma production in activated T cells. Because IFN gamma is a key activator of macrophages and T cells, IFN gamma is considered a vital cytokine for cell-mediated adaptive immune responses (such as a response to a bacterial pathogen). The purpose of the studies proposed in this application is to determine the mechanism by which Nrf2 inhibits IFN gamma production in T cells. This will be accomplished by 1) determining the mechanism by which activation of Nrf2 inhibits IFN gamma transcription 2) determining the mechanism by which tBHQ, a Nrf2 activator, impairs immune responses in vivo and 3) determining the effect of polymorphisms and other variations in the human Keap1 gene (Nrf2 repressor) on T cell function. Because numerous environmental contaminants, industrial byproducts, and commonly used synthetic food preservatives have been shown to activate Nrf2, the effects of Nrf2 activation on different organ systems needs to be fully characterized. This is particularly pertinent for the immune system in which the effects of Nrf2 on adaptive immunity are largely uncharacterized. Moreover, the long-term and/or cumulative exposure of numerous Nrf2 activators should also be considered. The overall purpose of these studies is to determine the mechanism by which Nrf2 impairs T cell function in order to better predict the effects of acute and long-term exposure to Nrf2 activators on the immune system in humans.",Role Of Nrf2 In Immunotoxicity By Food Additives And Environmental Contaminants,2012,2014,"Rockwell, Cheryl Elizabeth",Michigan State University,East Lansing,MI,27,1,111,4857

A significant effort has been made to understand the pathogenesis of this intracellular pathogen and the host factors that mediate host defense. Clinical and experimental evidence have unequivocally demonstrated that CD4+ T cells and IFN3 are critical for preventing systemic disease by non-typhoidal Salmonella. IFN3 likely exerts diverse functions in resistance to this intracellular bacterium, including the activation of the antimicrobial arsenal of macrophages. Recent studies have indicated that IFN3 synergizes with Salmonella ligands to enhance the transcription of iNOS. The resultant high NO synthesis mediates most of the profound and long-lasting anti-Salmonella activity of IFN3-primed macrophages. The molecular mechanism(s) by which IFN3- activated NO synthesis enhances the anti-Salmonella activity of macrophages remains, however, largely unknown. We have generated biochemical and genetic evidence in support of a model in which C203 of the SsrB response regulator that mediates global Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 (SPI2) transcription is an important target of reactive nitrogen species (RNS). The goal of this application is to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying the RNS-mediated repression of SPI2 transcription. It is hypothesized that NO congeners repress SPI2 transcription by S-nitrosylating (-SNO) C203 of the dimerization domain of the SsrB response regulator. Specifically, we propose to 1) determine the RNS-mediated modifications that inactivate SsrB regulatory functions; 2) examine SPI2 function in the context of Salmonella antinitrosative defenses; 3) select for ssrB variant alleles that render SsrB signaling insensitive to RNS; and 4) characterize SsrB residues critical for dimerization.

5R01HD061930-03,National Institute of Child Health and Human Development,23,"There is now strong data supporting our early hypothesis that the reduced incidence of enteric diseases in breastfeeding infants is due, in part, to protection by human milk glycans. Glycans, including glycoproteins, glycolipids, mucins, and glycosaminoglycans, contain complex oligosaccharide structures attached to proteins, lipids, and other molecular backbones. These complex carbohydrate moieties are synthesized by the many glycosyltransferases in the mammary gland; those glycans with homology to cell surface glycoconjugate pathogen receptors may inhibit pathogen binding, thereby protecting the nursing infant. Rotavirus and HIV infections in infants are introduced primarily through oral inoculation, and we discovered that these pathogenic viruses are strongly inhibited by specific high molecular weight human milk glycans in vitro. A subset of the human milk glycosaminoglycans, a chondroitin sulfate, and a component of the human milk sulfated glycosphingolipid fraction each strongly inhibit HIV in solid phase assays and in human leukocytes. A human milk glycoprotein, lactadherin (46 kDa), strongly inhibits rotavirus infection of MA 104 cells, and this molecule accounts for all of the inhibitory activity of human milk against rotaviruses in vitro. This proposal focuses on characterizing these actively antiviral glycans, using state-of-the-art instrumental analytical techniques that have recently become available and can provide detailed understanding of the molecular structure of complex glycan moieties. The molecular mechanisms will be studied to include the inhibition of multiple strains of the pathogens by the whole molecules. This will be followed by research to identify the smallest active moieties of the active molecules, and confirming their mechanism of pathogen inhibition.

5R01AI087747-03,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"The human bacterial pathogen group A Streptococcus (GAS) causes a broad spectrum of diseases, including pharyngitis, impetigo, and necrotizing fasciitis. The ability of GAS to cause such disease diversity is in part due to the coordinated expression of specific subsets of virulence factors. Small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) represent a poorly understood area of regulation in GAS and related pathogens. The goal of the proposed research is to characterize the mechanism of action of the virulence-regulating GAS sRNA FASX as a means to identify new targets for manipulation by novel antimicrobial agents. This research is of interest to the infectious diseases community as a consequence of the following observations. First, preliminary data indicates that FASX regulates GAS virulence. Second, the growth-phase-dependent transcription of FASX is consistent with a role in the transition of GAS between phases of infection. Third, the mechanism by which FASX, or indeed any GAS sRNA, regulates expression is unknown. Fourth, while sRNA-mediated regulation has been well-studied in pathogens that encode a homologue of the RNA-binding protein Hfq, little is known in those that lack an Hfq homologue (e.g. pathogens of the genera Streptococcus, Enterococcus, and Mycobacterium). We will achieve our goal by testing the following hypotheses: (i) FASX is a major regulator of GAS virulence factors. To identify the breath of FASX-mediated regulation in GAS we will use two-dimensional liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis to compare the proteomes of a clinical GAS isolate with its isogenic fasX mutant derivative. Proteomes will be compared in vitro and ex vivo, with ex vivo conditions being growth in human plasma (an invasive infection model) and human saliva (a pharyngeal infection model). (ii) FASX binds mRNAs and/or proteins to regulate virulence factor production. We have fused a streptomycin-binding RNA aptamer to FASX that enables the hybrid RNA to be retained within a streptomycin affinity matrix. We will isolate GAS mRNAs and/or proteins that interact with our FASX hybrid by performing pull-down assays. The identity of FASX-binding mRNAs and/or proteins will be determined through use of a custom microarray or by mass spec analysis, respectively, and confirmed using in vitro binding assays. (iii) Specific nucleotides within FASX are required for activity. To facilitate investigation of FASX regulatory targets and mechanism/s of action we will perform site-directed mutagenesis on fasX. FASX nucleotides will be scored as having no role, a moderate role, or a major role in activity based upon the ability of mutant fasX alleles to restore streptokinase activity to fasX mutant strain 2221FASX. Candidate FASX:mRNA interactions will be analyzed bioinformatically to highlight regions of complementary base-pairing. Putative base-pairing will be tested in vivo by fusing those mRNA regions predicted to hybridize with FASX to a lacZ reporter gene, and measuring 2-gal activity in the presence and absence of FASX.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Each year in the U.S. there are ~30 million cases of GAS pharyngitis.

5R01AI080671-04,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNT) are the etiological agents responsible for botulism, a disease characterized by peripheral neuromuscular blockade and a characteristic flaccid paralysis of humans. With the current warfare and terrorist activities a vastly enhanced defense against potential bioterrorist weapons is of high priority. BoNTs are potentially significant bioterrorism agents due to their relative ease of production, extreme potency and duration of paralytic activity. Countermeasures are needed to counteract the pathophysiology of BoNTs. In this context, the development of inhibitors of BoNTs would be a important breakthrough for the control of human botulism, and importantly, future terrorist threats. To date there are no current interventions that can reverse the effects of intoxication after the toxin has reached its target inside the cell. As such the overarching goal of our proposal is to uncover molecules that can act within an intoxicated cell to provide symptomatic relief to BoNT/A. There are seven serologically distinct serotypes of BoNT, however, we will only focused on BoNT/A as it exhibits the most sustained intoxication and therefore represents the greatest threat of any of the BoNTs. Working within this framework we have taken a two-pronged approach to define such molecules. The first is based on small non-peptidic molecules that can inhibit the intracellular agent, which causes botulinum neurotoxicity, a protease. For this initiative we will prepare mechanism-based inhibitors as well as try to enhance the potency of our previous lead compounds that have confirmed anti-botulinum properties within an animal assay. Our second initiative relates to the discovery of molecules that when administered will promote acetylcholine release and ones that will promote both acetylcholine release/acetylcholinesterase inhibition, in other words poly-functional intervention. In general we know relatively little about truly effective ways to counter toxin action at the 11th hour, and thus total reliance on any particular intervention is likely to be less than satisfactory. Furthermore, there is a vast difference in the time course of action of current potential antagonist and the toxin.

3R01DK061417-10S1,National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,24,"The intestinal epithelium mediates the absorption of life-sustaining nutrients while protecting against the large and diverse population of bacteria that colonize this surface. While, classically, the gut epithelium was thought to manage these tasks primarily by functioning as a passive, albeit highly selective, barrier, research over the last dozen years has demonstrated that, in fact, the gut epithelium plays a very active role in protecting the host from both the commensal and potentially pathogenic bacteria that can colonize this surface. Consequently, understanding the interactions between bacteria, epithelial cells, and immune cells is important to understanding bacterial pathogenesis in the gut, systemic infection by food-borne pathogens, and chronic inflammatory diseases of the intestine in which there is a seemingly inappropriate immune response directed at the commensal enteric microflora. Our in vitro modeling of bacterial epithelial-interactions performed under this proposal revealed that ligation of toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) by bacterial flagellin, the primary structural component of flagella, is a dominant means of activating innate immune signaling in intestinal epithelial cells. Flagellin is released by a number of pathogens and commensal microbes but TLR5 expression is polarized to the basolateral surface of the epithelium thus minimizing activation of pro-inflammatory signaling by flagellin released from commensal bacteria. Conversely, flagellated pathogens that can breech the epithelium or alter vesicular trafficking in epithelial cells activates TLR5-signaling in model epithelium. Such TLR5 signaling utilizes the NF-?B, MAPK and JaK-STAT signal transduction pathways result in a transient burst of gene expression seemingly designed to directly repel bacteria, recruit/activate immune cells, and prevent apoptosis. Such induction of gene expression can be envisaged to protect the host from pathogens but may contribute to the inflammatory sequellae associated with many enteric infections. Furthermore, that some pathogens such as Salmonella typhimurium have a specific mechanism that mediates release of flagellin monomers upon sensing of epithelial cells suggest that some pathogens might deliberately trigger TLR5 activation to aid in their dissemination. The in vivo studies performed to date are consistent with both of these possibilities. However, such studies have been far too limited in scope to provide a reasonable sense of the importance of the flagellin-TLR5 interaction in vivo let alone elucidate the mechanisms by which flagellin-induced signaling might affect the outcomes of host-bacteria interactions in health and disease. Thus, to fill this gap of knowledge, we outline a series of experiments to determine the mechanisms by which innate immune responses to flagellin affect the outcomes of host-bacterial interactions in vivo. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Salmonella remain amongst the most prolific and ubiquitous microbial causes of disease in both developed and developing countries. Human disease caused by Salmonella can be divided into 2 primary categories: 1) gut-restricted self-limiting gastroenteritis and Typhoid fever. Our research indicates that the interaction of the Salmonella protein flagellin with a host protein toll-like receptor 5 plays a key role in both disease processes. Thus, we propose to understand the role of the interaction in mouse models of disease.",Flagellin-Induced Gut Epithelial Chemokine Secretion,2002,2013,"Gewirtz, Andrew T",Georgia State University,Atlanta,GA,13,1,1426,3949
5R01AI056404-10,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"This application is for the renewal of the R01 AI056404-01 entitled Biochemical Characterization of Yersinia Effector YopJ that was funded from 9/30/03   1/31/08 and currently has less than a year of funding remaining. The bacterial effector YopJ inhibits MAPK and NFkB signaling pathways by preventing activation of MKKs and IKKb. As described in our Progress Report, we discovered that the bacterial effector YopJ is an acetyltransferase that modifies serine and threonine residues on the activation loop of MKKs, thereby, directly competing with and preventing activation of these kinases by phosphorylation. The overall goal of this grant is to elucidate the biochemical mechanism for the pathogenic effector expressed by Yersinia, YopJ that uses the newly discovered posttranslational modification of serine/threonine acetylation to modify proteins and to explore the possibility that this is a regulatory mechanism used by eukaryotes. We predict this activity is an evolutionarily conserved regulatory mechanism. Support for this claim comes from the discovery of the enzymatic properties of four other Yersinia effectors: YopH, a tyrosine phosphatase; YopE, a GAP; YpkA, a serine kinase; YopT, papain-like protease. Bacterial pathogens, as with viral pathogen's, usurp critical activities from their hosts and modified them to suit their own needs. In the case of Yersinia pestis, these virulence factors promote the pathogens proliferation at the deadly expense of the host. Clearly these effectors are important to study because all of them have had a profound impact on our way of thinking about eukaryotic signaling. Herein, we describe the Specific Aims that we will use to study this newly discovered posttranslational modification on serine and threonine residues. In these Aims we will use a yeast system that we established over the last funding period to analyze how YopJ interacts with MKKs and its mechanism of inhibition. These studies will provide insight into, not only the inhibitory activity of YopJ, but also the mechanisms that regulate MKK activation. We will also investigate the enzymatic mechanism used by the family of YopJ proteins to acetylate their substrates using kinetic studies. Finally, we will develop tools to study this newly discovered posttranslational modification and its role in eukaryotic signaling, including the discovery of eukaryotic enzymes that maybe involved in acteylation of serine and threonine residues and the possible reversal of this posttranslational modification.Yersinia pestis is the infectious agent that caused the Black Death in the Middle Ages, and Y. pseudotuberculosis and Y. enterocolitica (two closely related food borne pathogens) are causal agents of gastrointestinal disorders. One of the bacterial effectors produced by Yersinia, YopJ, is a 32kD protein that possesses the remarkable capacity to block multiple signaling pathways including all of the MAPK signaling pathways and the NFkB pathways, resulting in inhibition of the innate immune response and promotion of cell death in host cells. This application is for the Renewal of the R01 AI056404-01 grant where we discovered that YopJ utilizes a new type of posttranslational modification to inhibit signaling. YopJ is a serine and threonine acetyltransferase that modifies serine and threonine residues on the activation loop of MKKs, thereby, directly competing with and preventing phosphorylation by upstream kinases. The three Specific Aims proposed for the renewal of this grant are designed to use genetics and biochemistry to study this novel inhibitory mechanism and to investigate its possible use in eukaryotic signaling pathways.",Biochemical Characterization Of Yersinia Effector YopJ,2003,2013,"Orth, Kim ",Ut Southwestern Medical Center,Dallas,TX,51,1,-1,4899
1R15AI101977-01,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Vibrio cholerae Cytolysin (VCC) is a potent pore-forming toxin (PFT) that attacks human cells, although the specific targets of the toxin and role in pathogenesis are unknown. Understanding how pathogenic virulence factors recognize host membranes is an important first step towards developing therapies to block their action. This knowledge may also benefit the development of drugs that target diseased cells, such as cancer or virally infected cells. The long-term goal is to elucidate how pore-forming toxins recognize, assemble on, and disrupt cellular membranes from a structural and mechanistic perspective. The overall objective of this application, which is the next step towards obtaining this goal, is t understand how VCC targets motifs on cell membranes, including carbohydrate and cholesterol molecules. The VCC toxin contains two structural domains with folds similar to sugar-binding lectin proteins. Similar carbohydrate-binding domains are found on a variety of VCC toxin homologs with important human health implications, including toxins produced by Vibrio vulnificus, a cause of deadly food poisoning and sepsis. The central hypothesis of this project is that VCC recognizes membranes in a specific and reversible manner. This involves binding sites on the toxin molecule that increase the local concentration of toxin on the surface of the membrane. The rationale for the proposed work is that structural and functional characterization of VCC binding motifs will provide a clear understanding of the contribution that recognition sites  make towards the picomolar cytolytic activity of the toxin. In order to accomplish this goal, three  specific aims will be pursued: 1) Identify the carbohydrate ligands that VCC accessory domains target on cell membranes; 2) Structurally characterize interactions between VCC accessory domains and their respective ligands to understand the mechanism of ligand selectivity; and 3) Investigate the mechanism by which VCC recognizes cholesterol in eukaryotic membranes. Under the first aim, a combination of glycan screening and biophysical characterization will be used to identify and quantify carbohydrate ligands recog nized by VCC. Under the second aim, high-resolution structural analysis by X-ray crystallography will be used to understand the nature of ligand selectivity. Under the third aim, putative cholesterol binding-sites will be ana lyzed fo their contribution towards the recognition of susceptible cell membranes by VCC. The approach is in novative because it combines a comprehensive structural analysis with new screening technologies to answer fundamental questions about biological function. The proposed research is significant, because it will illuminate how this potent channel-forming toxin utilizes receptorsto assemble on cell membranes with high-affinity. This information will inform efforts to target toxins and drugs to specific cell membranes in order to treat infectious diseases and cancer.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because PFTs, such as VCC, are involved in the process of pathogen colonization and host damage. Understanding how toxins attack cells is essential for developing strategies to combat infectious disease.

5R01AI053669-10,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Project Summary/Abstract Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) is a model intracellular bacterial pathogen that causes serious foodborne illness in pregnant women, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals. Lm uses flagellar (swimming) motility to survive in extracellular environmental niches and aid in the invasion of host cells. During intracellular infection, Lm uses actin-based motility to move within the cytosol and spread from cell-to-cell. Reciprocal expression of flagellar and actin-based motility in response to environmental cues is critical to extracellular survival and intracellular pathogenesis of Lm. ActA is a surface protein that mediates actin- based motility, while PrfA (a DNA binding transcriptional activator) and the 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) of actA transcripts function to achieve high-level compartment-specific expression of ActA in the cytosol. In contrast, flagellar motility is repressed in the intracellular environment and expressed during extracellular growth in response to temperature via a regulatory cascade involving MogR (a DNA binding transcriptional repressor), DegU (a response regulator), and GmaR (an anti-repressor for MogR). The focus of this proposal is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms governing the reciprocal regulation of flagellar and actin-based motility in response to temperature and the intracellular environment. In Aim I, the precise contribution of the PrfA-regulated promoter and 5' UTR of actA for compartment-specific expression in the cytosol will be determined. This will be accomplished using actA-gfp reporter fusions in wild-type and mutant strains defective for progression through specific stages of intracellular infection. Quantitative fluorescence and time- lapse video microscopy will be used to define the level and kinetics of expression within individual bacterial cells. In Aim II, specific accessory factors that govern DegU-mediated transcriptional activation of gmaR in response to low temperature will be identified using DNA affinity purification and random transposon mutagenesis. Accessory factor mutant strains will be evaluated for GmaR expression and flagellar motility. The protein/DNA interactions controlling temperature-dependent activation of gmaR will be determined by co-affinity purification and gel mobility shift analysis. In Aim III, we will define the precise structural and mechanistic features that mediate anti-repression via direct GmaR:MogR interaction. Co-affinity purification analysis of MogR truncation proteins with full-length GmaR and evaluation of GmaR truncation proteins for complementation of flagellar motility will be performed. In Aim IV, insight into host-derived signals that are sensed to regulate expression of ActA will be determined by fractionation and purification of serum-derived components that activate actA-gfp fusion constructs. The precise step in the flagellar expression cascade that is inhibited during intracellular infection at low temperature will be determined by characterizing production and function of DegU, accessory factors, and GmaR during intracellular infection. Project Narrative Listeria monocytogenes is a bacterial pathogen that grows inside of human cells and causes serious foodborne illness. Persistence in food processing environments and infection of human cells is facilitated by the ability of bacteria to become motile in response to sensing environmental signals such as extracellular temperature and the intracellular environment. The proposed studies will determine the molecular mechanisms that L. monocytogenes uses to regulate motility in response to environmental cues, thus providing valuable insight into fundamental mechanisms of bacterial pathogenesis.",Temporal Requirements For Intracellular Pathogenesis,2002,2013,"Higgins, Darren E",Harvard Medical School,Boston,MA,26,1,-1,-1

Typhi disease, but also against paratyphoid B fever. The overall goal of this application is to study the  immunological mechanisms that could mediate this cross-protection. The proposed studies will focus on  investigating whether the array of cell-mediated immunity (CMI) and Ab responses elicited by immunization  of subjects with the licensed Ty21 a typhoid vaccine, as well as novel attenuated S. Typhi vaccine  candidates, which are likely to be involved in protection, cross-react with S. Paratyphi A and B antigens.  Specifically, we propose to address the following Specific Aims: Aim 1. Test the hypothesis that a defined  set of CMI responses in circulation play a key role in cross-protection between S. Typhi strain Ty21a and S.  Paratyphi B infection in humans. To this end, we will use cells from subjects immunized with Ty21a to  evaluate whether there is cross-reactivity between CMI responses (e.g., cytokine production, proliferative  responses, cytotoxic activity) to S. Typhi, S. Paratyphi A and S. Paratyphi B. We hypothesize that crossreactivity  will be chiefly observed between S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi B, with minor, if any, cross-reactivity  with S. Paratyphi A antigens, Aim 2. Evaluate the hypothesis that the CMI responses observed in Ty21a  vaccinees that show cross-reactivity between S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi B antigens (Aim 1) are also elicited  by oral immunization of subjects with novel attenuated S. Typhi candidate vaccine strains CVD 908-htrA and  CVD 909. These studies will assess the likelihood that immunization with these novel attenuated S. Typhi  candidate vaccine strains will result in a broad-spectrum S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi B (and perhaps S.

1R21AI101504-01,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"A major challenge in development of therapies for neurodegenerative diseases, including botulism, is the low efficiency and low specificity of existing treatments for targeting the therapeutic agents selectively to nerve cells without involvement of secondary sites of action. We have already demonstrated that we can specifically deliver a prototype cargo GFP into neuronal cells in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo, and w are now poised to translate this prototype cargo-delivery vehicle into a medically relevant inhibitory cargo-delivery vehicle(s) against botulism. We propose herein two antitoxin approaches toward combating paralysis from botulism, both based on our BoNT/A-HC platform. To demonstrate feasibility and versatility of our BoNT/A-HC-based platform for therapeutic biomolecule cargos targeted for neuronal-specific delivery, we propose to exchange the GFP cargo in our prototype GFP-BoNT/A-HC construct with two different types of cargo moieties, which will comprise the two aims of this proposal: Aim 1. Peptide/protein-based inhibitory cargo-delivery vehicles, and Aim 2. Biotin-streptavidin-linked inhibitory cargos-delivery vehicles. The proposed studies will be conducted in 3 phases for each construct of each aim: Phase I (R21 component, years 1-2) - Construction, purification, characterization and optimization of the BoNT/A-HC-based cargo-delivery vehicles and preliminary testing of the cargo-delivery vehicles for functionality in neuronal-specific cellular uptake in cultured neuronal cells. Phase II (R33 component, years 3-4) - Further optimization of cargo-delivery vehicle for stability, expression yield and intracellular cargo release. Testing the cargo-BoNT/A-HC delivery vehicle for functionality (delivery of cargo, inhibition of BoNT/A-mediated SNAP25 cleavage) in neuronal-specific cellular uptake in cultured neuronal cells; ex vivo in peroneal nerve-EDL muscle preparations; and in vivo after injection in mice. Phase III (R33 component, years 4-5) - Testing the cargo-BoNT/A-HC delivery vehicle for functionality and effectiveness in neuroprotective activity, such as protection from or recovery of neurotransmitter release after BoNT/A challenge, detection of increased expression of toxin-neutralizing scFv or camelid antibodies or SNAPI proteins encoded by DNA vectors.

As wildlife and human exposure occurs largely through fish, 44 states have issued fish consumption advisories regarding Hg contamination including 21 statewide advisories for freshwater and 12 for coastal waters. More than 90% of fish and shellfish consumed by humans come from marine systems but research on Hg fate in marine ecosystems remains limited. Humans and wildlife also have elevated exposures to Hg via fish from reservoirs that are considered Hg hotspots. Project 7 studies mechanisms driving site-to site variation in bioavailability, bioaccumulation, and trophic transfer of Hg in aquatic food webs across a gradient from forested to industrialized watersheds. In both field and experimental studies we will investigate parallel processes influencing inorganic and MeHg fate in reservoirs and estuaries with a focus on lower trophic levels where Hg enters the food web. We predict that site-to-site variation in Hg bioavailability and bioaccumulation will be based on environmental properties such as physical (surface area, watershed area), chemical (pH, nutrients, organic carbon), ecological (benthic and pelagic feeding), and land use factors (agricultural, forested, industrial). We will use field survey and experimental approaches to identify the mechanisms controlling Hg bioavailability to pelagic and benthic food webs and evaluate their relative importance as conduits of Hg trophic transfer. This proposal has three specific aims. Aim 1 characterizes Hg bioavailability, bioaccumulation, and trophic transfer in the field and tests whether the bioaccumulation and transfer of Hg is enhanced in contaminated sites while at the same time diminished by increasing organic matter in the environment. Aim 2 investigates the strength and consistency of benthic vs. pelagic food webs as conduits of Hg to fish and the degree to which the quantity and quality of organic matter in sediments and water diminish Hg uptake and transfer. Aim 3 investigates the role of specific mechanisms such as somatic growth dilution in controlling bioaccumulation of Hg by individual organisms. Results from all three aims will be synthesized into a mathematical contaminant fate model that will assess the net effect of the multiple ecological and biogeochemical factors influencing Hg bioavailability, bioaccumulation, and trophic transfer.",Project 7: Bioaccumulation And Trophic Transfer Of Mercury In Aquatic Food Webs,,2014,"Chen, Celia Y",Dartmouth College,Hanover,NH,34,1,72,5633

5K22AI085116-02,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"There exists a fundamental gap in understanding how CD8+ T cells, which target intracellular pathogens, protect against pathogens like Yersinia, which exist extracellularly. The candidate's long-term scientific goal is to understand mechanisms used by CD8+ T cells to recognize and eliminate Yersinia and mechanisms used by the bacteria to evade immune recognition and clearance. The objective of proposed research is to determine how T cell- and bacterial-induced apoptosis influences Yersinia infection outcomes. The central hypothesis is that the pro-apoptotic factors expressed by host and pathogen, specifically perforin from CD8+ T cells and YopJ from Yersinia, limit bacterial infection by inducing apoptosis of Yersinia-associated host cells and flagging them for phagocytic removal. Guided by strong preliminary data, two specific aims will test this hypothesis: 1) determine the contribution of perforin to CD8+ T cell-mediated elimination of host cell-associated Yersinia; and 2) determine how modulation of apoptosis by genetic or chemical manipulation influences Yersinia infection. Under the first aim, Yersinia challenge of mice with perforin-sufficient or -deficient antigen-specific CD8+ T cells will address if perforin-mediated apoptosis is required for CD8+ T cell-dependent protection. In the second aim, the consequence of genetic or chemical manipulation of apoptosis in vivo for Yersinia infection will be examined. The approach is innovative, because it manipulates both host and pathogen processes to reveal host-protective actions. The proposed work is significant, because it will advance understanding of host responses to Yersinia and suggest ways to improve current vaccines to maximally stimulate Yersinia-specific protective immunity.

5P42ES004940-23,National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences,25,"Chronic exposure to arsenic in drinking water has been linked recently to cardiovascular disease. The heart and vasculature are the first organ system to form during development making it highly vulnerable to defects and adult disease due to fetal exposure to toxicants. In this regard, there is increased incidence in first trimester miscarriages, which are likely due to structural heart defects, in communities exposed to high levels of arsenic. Further, populations exposed to arsenic through contaminated drinking water have increased incidences of both heart and vascular diseases. The correct program of gene expression related to cardiovascular development and maintenance is essential and we have initial observations showing disruption by arsenic on key factors in this process. Specifically extracellular matrix (ECM) and TGFbeta2 are down-regulated by arsenic exposure during critical developmental periods for normal heart structure formation. The ECM component hyaluronan and TGFbeta2 are required for epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) to contribute cardiac mesenchyme for heart valve formation and partitioning of the chambers. We will determine in Aim 1 whether arsenic attenuates these critical factors in vitro and in vivo. In Aim 2 we will determine the extent of disruption in valve formation which can lead to valve prolapse and disease later in life. We further show in adult mice that the ECM is disrupted by arsenic ingestion altering the vascular integrity predisposing the animals to vascular disease. Connective tissue disorders have mitral valve prolapse in addition to aortic aneurysisms and ruptures, with the later condition being already linked to arsenic. The ECM contains critical molecular targets for the effects of arsenic on the cardiovascular; however, the mechanisms responsible for these outcomes are not known. Although arsenic may not cause severe enough structural heart defects to abort fetal or neonatal development, subtle alterations may translate into disease predisposition in adults. As disease in adults is speculated to have origins during development, we will determine if fetal-arsenic exposure relates to structural heart valve defects, and vessel pathologies leading to heart disease.",Project 5: As Effects On Cardiovascular Development And Disease,,,"Camenisch, Todd D",University of Arizona,Tucson,AZ,4,1,167,-1
5R01AI077502-09,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Toxoplasma gondii is a protozoan parasite that poses a significant risk to AIDS patients and is listed by NIAID as a Category B Priority Pathogen for biodefense. Fundamental to the pathogenic process is the ability of the parasite to develop into a latent tissue cyst that can re-emerge as a rapidly growing form upon impairment of immunity. Increased understanding of this developmental process will provide new opportunities for therapeutic intervention. The work in our first award period focused on GCN5 histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and led to the discovery that histone acetylation correlates with gene expression pertinent to Toxoplasma development. We have taken genetic approaches to define the roles of two distinct GCN5-family HATs we have characterized in Toxoplasma (TgGCN5-A and -B). We have found that the loss of TgGCN5 impairs the ability of Toxoplasma to up-regulate key developmentally expressed genes. We have also determined that some of the proteins interacting with TgGCN5 in a yeast two-hybrid screen have domains typical of transcriptional regulators; this is significant because the lack of DNA-binding transcription factors detectable in the Toxoplasma genome has hampered efforts to understand how gene expression is regulated. How Toxoplasma regulates transcription to grow effectively during the acute stage, and develop into a latent cyst during stress, represent major gaps in our knowledge that hinder our ability to fight the opportunistic infection. The data generated by the first award allow us to focus this renewal on defining mechanisms of GCN5- mediated gene regulation in the context of parasite development, which underlies pathogenesis. We hypothesize that the TgGCN5 HATs play key roles in Toxoplasma pathogenesis by forming distinct complexes with novel proteins that regulate developmental gene expression. Our specific aims include (1) Determine the roles of TgGCN5 HATs in pathogenesis; (2) Elucidate differences in TgGCN5 complexes during Toxoplasma development; (3) Define the mechanism by which each TgGCN5 is recruited to target gene promoters to coordinate developmental gene expression. The proposed research capitalizes on the novel reagents, techniques, and transgenic parasites that we have developed. The data generated will illuminate the mechanism behind developmental transitions in Toxoplasma that are responsible for disease progression, thus exposing novel points of therapeutic intervention. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Toxoplasma gondii is a protozoan parasite that causes significant disease as an opportunistic infection of AIDS patients. Chronic toxoplasmosis is currently incurable because the parasite is able to develop into cysts that remain latent until immunosuppression. The mechanisms driving the development of these cysts are the focus of our studies, as learning how Toxoplasma develops will identify novel points of therapeutic intervention. We are taking an innovative approach to use transcriptional regulators as a means to elucidate the mechanisms of parasite development.

5R37AI042347-17,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Mobile genetic elements have profoundly influenced the evolution of bacterial pathogens. Many determinants of virulence and antibiotic resistance are borne by mobile elements, such as plasmids and bacteriophages, which are capable of horizontal transmission. During this grant cycle, we studied several aspects of the life cycle of CTXF, a filamentous phage that encodes cholera toxin, the principal virulence factor of the cholera pathogen Vibrio cholerae. We described novel mechanisms that mediate the integration of CTXF into the V. cholerae chromosome and that govern CTXF gene expression. We also expanded the scope of our work to explore several aspects of the molecular biology of SXT, a V. cholerae-derived integrating conjugative element (ICE) that encodes multiple antibiotic resistance genes. In recent years, SXT and closely related elements have become highly prevalent in V. cholerae clinical isolates. Our long-term goal is to decipher the molecular mechanisms that enable the dissemination of CTXF and SXT. We propose to explore 5 aspects of the molecular biology of CTXF and SXT that govern their transmission and evolution. Experiments in Aim I to elucidate mechanisms that control expression of RstR, the CTXF repressor, will reveal how two host factors, LexA and RpoS, contribute to the novel genetic circuitry governing CTXF production. In Aims II-V, we will explore the molecular bases for aspects of the SXT life-cycle that distinguish this mobile element from phages and plasmids. Studying these novel features of SXT will enhance our understanding of ICEs, an extensive and medically important set of mobile elements that have not been subject to intensive study, and will shed light on processes that have contributed to the prevalence and diversity of SXT-related ICEs in the gamma proteobacteria. In particular, we will explore II) steps in SXT conjugation that limit its transfer to new hosts, III) genes required for SXT maintenance in donor cells, IV) mechanisms for preventing redundant transmission of SXT to hosts in which it is already present and V) processes by which new/hybrid SXT-related ICEs are generated. Completion of these studies will enhance our understanding of the mechanisms that control of horizontal gene transfer and yield knowledge of fundamental aspects of prokaryote cell biology and pathogen evolution.

5R44AI081531-04,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) are the most toxic substances known to humans, causing respiratory failure. Because of their lethality and ease of production, the Department of Defense (DoD) designates BoNTs as a category A bioterrorism agent. Developing effective, post-exposure antagonists to BoNT is among DoD's top priorities. Despite their lethality, BoNTs have cosmetic and pharmaceutical applications and are currently FDA-approved for treating glabellar lines (wrinkles), cervical dystonia, chronic migraines, blepharospasm, cranial nerve VII disorders, and cosmoses. BoNTs provide relief of muscle tension by silencing neurons that cause muscle contraction. For many disorders, BoNT-based treatments provide significant and long lasting pain reduction. BoNTs' exquisite specificity for neurons and long time of action make it a lead candidate for treating neurological and muscle disorders where other treatments have failed. Developing new BoNT-based therapies is hindered by the lack of assays to measure BoNT activity. Currently, the only widely accepted method involves injecting BoNT into mice and counting how many mice die after 1+ days. This process is slow, requires special facilities, and is very low-throughput; antagonist screening or developing new BoNT-derived therapeutics is prohibitively expensive and time-consuming. BioSentinel recently developed engineered cell lines that stably express a reporter for the detection of BoNT/A in living cells. These cell lines will become BoCell A, a cell-based assay for the detection of BoNT/A. The overall objectives of this Phase II proposal are to commercialize and validate the BoCell A assay and develop cell-based assays for detecting BoNT/B and E. Because BoNT has three activities-cell receptor binding and uptake, vesicle translocation, and target cleavage-a cell-based assay is required to effectively measure BoNT activity. BioSentinel developed a cell-based assay that measures BoNT activity by using fluorescence emission to monitor BoNT cleavage of SNARE proteins, the target of BoNT. BioSentinel will validate the BoCell A assay for biological relevance and high-throughput applications, and begin working to develop a second-generation BoCell A assay with sensitivity that matches that of the mouse bioassay. In addition, BioSentinel will build upon its Phase I accomplishment of identifying reporters that detect BoNT/B in living cells and engineer cell lines that stably express the reporters. Finally, the BoCell A assay will be engineered for the uptake and detection of BoNT/E. BioSentinel proposes to develop, validate, and commercialize assays that will enable researchers, clinicians, and pharmaceutical companies to rapidly quantify BoNT preparations, perform quality control measures, screen for new BoNT-based therapies, and screen for BoNT antagonists. Because of increased pressure for animal-free, high-throughput assays, a cell-based BoNT detection assay is greatly desired by researchers and industry, and would open a gateway to developing new BoNT-based therapies.",A Cell-Based Assay For Botulinum Neurotoxin Detection And Development,2009,2014,"Tucker, Ward C","Biosentinel, Llc",Del Mar,CA,6,1,-1,3985
5R01AI083162-04,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"The protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii is an important human and veterinary pathogen. In humans, acute disease is caused by rapidly growing 'tachyzoites' while chronic diseases is caused by latent 'bradyzoite' tissue cysts; both stages are essential for disease propagation and causation. Tachyzoites are responsible for congenital birth defects and latent bradyzoites represent a continual threat to immunocompromised (AIDS) patients. The interconversion process between tachyzoites and bradyzoites is central to the parasite's survival and pathogenicity, yet it remains poorly understood. Several lines of evidence have linked chromatin remodeling with parasite development into bradyzoite cysts, but the fundamental units of chromatin - histones - remain to be characterized in this important parasite. Our preliminary results show that T. gondii has a canonical H2A as well as two H2A variants (H2AX and H2AZ). In addition, it has a canonical H2B and H2B variant (H2Bv). The H2A and H2B class of histones and histone variants in T. gondii are unusual in sequence composition and how they interact. Thus a major gap in our knowledge is how T. gondii nucleosomes are structured and post-translationally modified in the different stages of the parasite. In specific aim 1 we will determine the configuration of H2A and H2B histones in T. gondii nucleosomes and will analyze nucleosome composition of active and silent chromatin during bradyzoite development. In specific aim 2 we will identify non-histone proteins associating with T. gondii H2As and H2Bs histones during in both tachyzoites and bradyzoites. Determination of the non-histone proteins that associate with these histone variants is essential to learn more about the function of these histones in parasite physiology, and will illuminate the key proteins regulating the reading and writing of the Toxoplasma histone code. In specific aim 3, we will construct a post-translational modification map of T. gondii H2As and H2Bs histones in the different parasite stages. Given the sequence disparity and unusual variants in the T. gondii histone classes, it is important to identify the post-translational modifications on these histones during tachyzoite and bradyzoite stages. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Toxoplasma gondii has achieved notoriety as a cause of life-threatening opportunistic disease in immunocompromised individuals. In addition, with the growing threat of bioterrorism this parasite is now listed as a Category B pathogen in the NIH/CDC list of priority pathogens.

5R01GM098878-02,National Institute of General Medical Sciences,93,"The phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotranferase system (PTS) is a multicomponent carbohydrate uptake system that is also involved in the regulation of metabolism, chemotaxis, and pathogenicity in bacteria. The PTS drives active transport of sugar by coupling the translocation of the ligand across the membrane with its concomitant covalent modification by phosphorylation to prevent efflux. The PTS has been the subject of extensive study for nearly half a century, but our understanding of the system has remained incomplete due to the lack of any structures for the integral membrane component EIIC responsible for the transport of the sugar across the inner membrane. The EIICs also confer specificity for a particular sugar to the PTS, and assist in the transfer of the phosphate from the cytoplasmic PTS protein EIIB to the sugar. We intend to address this gap in the mechanistic understanding of the PTS by combining structural and functional studies of ChbC, a member of the glucose EIIC superfamily that is specific for the uptake of N.N'- diacetylchitobiose. This sugar is produced by the breakdown of chitin, and as an important nutrient in the life cycle of pathogens such as Vibrio cholerae. To this end, we have solved the structure of a ChbC ortholog from Bacillus cereus (bcChbC), which has led us to propose hypotheses for how the transporter selectively binds sugar, translocates it across the membrane, and assists in coupling phosphorylation to transport. We will use this structure to understand the mechanism of EIIC function with three aims: (1) to determine the structural basis of bcChbC's substrate selectivity with binding and uptake assays, (2) to uncover the mechanism of phosphorylation by solving the structure of an bcChbC in complex with its partner EIIB, bcChbB, and (3) to reconstruct the conformational changes underlying the transport cycle by solving the structure of the outward- facing open state of bcChbC.",Structure And Function Of A Phosphorylation Coupled Saccharide Transporter,2011,2013,"Zhou, Ming ",Columbia University Health Sciences,New York,NY,37,1,-1,5295

Hepatocarcinomas are the third most common cause of cancer death in the world. Hepatitis infections and  dietary aflatoxin are major risk factors contributing to the incidence of this disease. The aflatoxigenic  Aspergillus species, A. parasticus, A. flavus and A. nomius, commonly infect grains and food stuffs where clear  epidemiological data correlate to human disease. Chronic ingestion is a major cause of premature death in  Asia, Africa and Central America. A direct link has been forged between the interaction of the metabolically  activated form of the toxini and DNA, particularly in a &#191;hot spot&#191; in the p53 gene leading to mutation of its  important encoded cell cycle regulating protein. Understanding its biosynthesis will lead to control of this  environmental carcinogen.  The aflatoxins are created by an unusually long and complex biosynthesis. Key molecular rearrangements,  some remarkable mechanistically, are catalyzed by cytochromes P450. The mechanisms of these cleavage and  rearrangement reactions will be studied and modeled by chemical mimetics to understand their underlying  chemistry. The second, and principal, goal is to capitalize upon exciting progress made in the current grant  period to understand the function of non-reducing iterative polyketide synthases central to aflatoxin  biosynthesis and many other fungal natural products. Of the three principal types of PKSs, least is known  about the &#191;programming&#191; of iterative Type I systems; that is, how are starter units recruited and synthesis  begun, how is chain length determined, how is the canonical and intrinsically reactive poly &#946;-keto  intermediate stabilized, how is redox state controlled during chain elongation, and, finally, how are  intramolecular cyclizations controlled to specific ring forms in preference to others. Superimposed on this is  the fundamental question of iterative catalysis, a rare but impressively efficient process in which active sites in  these polydomainal enzymes are used over and over again, accommodating a sequence of growing substrates  yet faithfully executing a synthetic program. We have discovered two previously unrecognized domains in  these domains we now believe are general to this class of enzymes, a &#191;starter unit:acyl-carrier protein  transacylase&#191; (SAT) domain, which might account for the classical observation of a &#191;starter unit effect,&#191; and a  &#191;product template&#191; (PT) domain, which in preliminary results clearly has a role in polyketide stabilization and  product templating.

Moreover, the research will study the mechanism through which LPA2 receptor- mediated signaling events regulate CFTR-dependent electrolyte secretion in cells and fluid secretion in an animal model of diarrhea. Three aims will be studied: Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that LPA2 receptor is primarily expressed on the luminal surface of the gut and is down regulated in certain forms of diarrheal diseases, and to test the hypothesis that activation of LPA2 receptor inhibits compartmentalized cAMP generation at the plasma membrane. Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that LPA can regulate the formation of the LPA2-containing macromolecular complex by further clustering it to microdomain on the plasma membrane and that the process is mediated by NHERF2-dependent protein-protein interactions Aim 3: To test the hypothesis that disruption of the macromolecular complex by silencing NHERF2 alters compartmentalized cAMP levels at the plasma membrane and that in vivo NHERF2 knockout mice generate altered cAMP in response to CTX.

5R01ES017541-04,National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences,25,"Genetic Susceptibility to Cardiovascular Effects of Arsenic Exposure Project summary cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide. Recent experimental studies support the hypothesis that As exposure leads to oxidative stress and vascular inflammation, a central mechanism to the development of atherosclerosis and CVD. Studies of other health effects of As exposure have suggested effect-modification by As methylation capacity and genetic susceptibility. However, epidemiologic studies of genetic susceptibility to the effects of As exposure on CVD risk are lacking. In the year 2000, we established the Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study (HEALS), a prospective cohort study of 11,746 participants (original cohort), in Araihazar, Bangladesh. In 2007, HEALS recruited another 8,288 participants (expansion cohort) to include a total of 20,034 participants. More than 90% of the cohort have exposed to As exposure at low-to-moderate levels (<300 5g/L), providing us with a unique opportunity to assess health effects of As exposure from drinking water at the levels of public health interest. As part of the parent study, cardiovascular outcomes of the cohort participants are being ascertained, and carotid artery intima-medial thickness (IMT) is being measured for 1,160 participants randomly selected from the original cohort. On the basis of these resources, our substantial pilot data, as well as cohort analyses which show a positive association between As exposure and CVD incidence and mortality, we propose a series of analyses to assess the genetic susceptibility to the effects of As exposure on the risk of atherosclerosis and CVD. We will evaluate whether the cardiovascular effects of As exposure differ by polymorphisms in genes related to As methylation (GSTM1, GSTT1, GSTO1, GSTP1, MTHFR, and AS3MT genes) and genes related to oxidative stress (NOS3, SOD2, and CYBA) and inflammation/endothelial dysfunction (TNF, IL6, ICAM1, and VCAM1) using a cross-sectional study of IMT with the subcohort of 1,160 participants, and a case-cohort study of CVD risk with 692 cases and the same subcohort of 1,160 participants from the original cohort. The strongest gene- As interaction will be tested again in a second case-cohort study with 305 cases and another subcohort of 520 participants selected from the expansion cohort. To further characterize the underlying mechanisms by which As exposure causes CVD, we will conduct a cross-sectional study with 300 subjects to evaluate the associations between As exposure and serum/urinary phenotypic markers for oxidative stress and inflammation. The proposed study will provide valuable knowledge about the pathophysiology and mechanism by which As exposure may lead to CVD and may also lead to improved prevention and risk assessment of As exposure.

However, the mechanism by which As causes cancers has not been elucidated. The long-term goal of this study is to determine the mechanism of As carcinogenesis and identify molecular targets for the treatment and prevention of cancers resulting from As exposure.  Accumulating evidence suggests a critical role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in cancer progression. Nevertheless, it has not been determined whether miRNAs causally contribute to chemical carcinogenesis. Our preliminary studies demonstrated that As treatment caused depletion of miR-200b and 200c and induced transformation of human normal bronchial epithelial cells in which p53 expression was knocked down. Re- expressing miR-200b or 200c significantly and greatly reversed transformed phenotypes. We hypothesize that loss of p53 and down-regulation of miR-200b and/or 200c contribute to arsenic lung carcinogenesis. Three specific aims are proposed to test this hypothesis. Specific Aim 1: To determine the roles of miR-200b/200c and their target genes ZEB1 and ZEB2 in As-induced cell transformation and tumorigenesis. We hypothesize that ectopic expression of miR-200b/200c or depletion of ZEB1/ZEB2 inhibits cell transformation by As. Specific Aim 2: To investigate whether whether the ZEB1/ZEB2 heterozygous knockout mice are resistant or less sensitive to As lung carcinogenesis. We hypothesize that ZEB1/ZEB2 heterozygous knockout mice will be resistant or less sensitive to As lung carcinogenesis. Specific Aim 3: To determine the mechanism by which As causes ZEB1 and ZEB2 expression. Based on our preliminary findings, we hypothesize that TGF-beta signaling plays a critical role in the induction of ZEB1/ZEB2 expression by As exposure.

During the initial period of the SCDNS, prenatal exposure to MeHg  and selected nutrients were measured and neurodevelopment of cohort of 229 children was evaluated  through the first 30 months of life. We found no evidence of independent adverse effects of prenatal MeHg  on developmental outcomes within the range of MeHg exposure studied (1-18 ppm in maternal hair). However, there was an adverse effect of prenatal MeHg exposure on psychomotor ability when statistical  models were adjusted for maternal dietary intake and nutritional status. This effect was due to maternal  serum levels of )-3 and )-6 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA). )-3 LCPUFA levels had a  beneficial influence on psychomotor development while both MeHg and )-6 LCPUFA adversely affected  psychomotor development. Thus, LCPUFA might have a direct impact on developmental endpoints and  modify the MeHg effect. It is also likely that other nutritional covariates might further modify the toxicity of  MeHg. Our aim is to extend the SCDNS to pursue an innovate study to test in more depth the parameters  of our recently published novel finding showing an apparent modulation of MeHg neurotoxicity by  LCPUFA. The initial study measured a limited number of candidate nutrients present in fish and enrolled a  cohort based on power estimates from our earlier studies. In retrospect, we underestimated the complexity  of nutrient effects on neurotoxicity and development. Using a larger more powerful cohort (n~1,500) being  recruited by the Seychelles Ministry of Health, we plan to confirm the main effects found to date and test  interactions between MeHg and LCPUFA. Our plan also includes assaying vitamin E and selenium status  in pregnancy as possible modifiers of the combined effects of MeHg and LCPUFA on development. The  new cohort will be assessed for development using measures that showed an association between either  MeHg alone, LCPUFA alone or the combination of both in our initial study. Measures of social  communication and behavior will be added to increase the scope of the  assessment Continuing the SCDNS utilizing a larger cohort and focusing specifically on the role of  LCPUFA in relation to MeHg neurotoxic exposures and child development should allow us to efficiently  pursue the scientific questions raised by our first five years of study. It will also contribute to establishing the  risks and benefits of fish consumption during pregnancy. In addition we will begin to study the broader  question of how diet may interact with MeHg exposure. These results should enable regulators to  promulgate scientifically based advisories concerning safety of consuming fish during pregnancy.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Public Health Significance  Human exposure to MeHg is almost exclusively from fish consumption and all fish  contain some MeHg. Fish also provide other nutrients such as Long chain  Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (LCPUFA) that are essential for brain development and  exert a beneficial influence on child development. Our results to date suggest that the  beneficial influence of LCPUFA on neurodevelopment may modulate adverse effects of  MeHg. The proposed study will determine if other dietary nutrients can reduce the  neurotoxicity of MeHg and increment the effects of LCPUFA. The results should have  immediate and important public health implications not only for agencies that advise the  public about fish consumption, but also for public health policies regarding nutrient intake  during pregnancy.",Factors Modifying The Toxicity Of Methylmercury In A Fish-Eating Population,2000,2014,"Davidson, Philip W",University of Rochester,Rochester,NY,37,1,214,678

Using a novel cell-based Norwalk virus (NV) replication system, we have identified viral proteinase (Pro) and cellular acyl-coenzyme Axholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) as potential therapeutic targets and have furthermore demonstrated that two classes of compounds significantly reduced virus replication, presumably via the inhibition of viral Pro and ACAT, respectively. Since NV Pro and ACAT play a critical role in viral replication, the hypothesis is advanced that agents capable of inhibiting these enzymes selectively are of potential therapeutic value. Thus, the long term goal of this program is the development of novel small molecule therapeutics against human noroviruses by advancing the active compounds through the stage prior to filing an IND application with the FDA. We have established the following specific aims for advancing our hit compounds into a drug candidate for preclinical development.

While many of the components of these complex machines are highly conserved and functionally interchangeable, each bacterium delivers its own unique set of effectors into host cells. A complete understanding of how the bacteria ensure that only small subsets of the thousands of proteins they encode are specifically delivered into host cells remains unclear. My laboratory recently developed a novel yeast-based visualization assay to identify interacting proteins in living cells, the Protein Interaction Platform assay or PIP. Remarkably, we found that one chaperone, Spa15, interacted with 10 effectors, nine of which we subsequently established require Spa15 for their efficient type III secretion. Furthermore, we find that the Spa15 homologs from eight bacterial species are functionally interchangeable with Spa15. All nine proteins recognize a defined chaperone-binding domain sequence. Given the functional interchangeable of these eight chaperones, we hypothesize that they recognize effectors and deliver effectors to the secretion apparatus by conserved mechanisms. The goals of the proposal are to begin to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying these important steps in type III secretion. Specifically we propose to (a) investigate how class IB chaperones differentiate between effectors and housekeeping proteins (Aim 1) and (b) determine how chaperone/effector complexes are recruited to the type III secretion apparatus (Aim 2).

5R01AI077662-04,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Increased parasite burden is a key factor in the severity of clinical toxoplasmosis and thus, pathogenesis in Toxoplasma gondii infections is caused primarily by the growth of the parasite. From recent genetic analysis it has become clear that a shortened tachyzoite cell cycle is a key virulence determinant in Toxoplasma, yet we have few molecular details about how replication is regulated in this parasite. Toxoplasma tachyzoites divide by a novel cycle where the duplication of a complex set of organelles is coordinated with an unusual bimodal S phase and a phylum-specific budding process is synchronized with, and may regulate, aspects of mitosis. The binary division of Toxoplasma tachyzoites undergoing endodyogeny offers advantages for the investigation of the apicomplexan cell cycle, although these studies will apply broadly to the growth of other pathogens in this family, such as Plasmodium, Eimeria, and Cryptosporidium, where our knowledge of parasite cell cycle mechanisms is equally deficient. In this application, we propose a comprehensive study of the mechanisms controlling the replication of virulent Type I-RH tachyzoites. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that at least four checkpoints in G1, early and late S, and mitosis regulate the RH tachyzoite cell cycle through the analysis of a large collection of temperature sensitive (ts) growth mutants (165 total), which we have produced by chemical mutagenesis. In Aim 2, we will examine the hypothesis that known as well as unique apicomplexan proteins are required for tachyzoite checkpoint control through cosmid-based genetic complementation, which will identify the essential genes involved in specific ts-mutants. Finally, in Aim 3, we will define the role of the daughter/mitotic cytoskeletons in regulating checkpoints that control chromosome replication. In preliminary studies, we have established high throughput protocols for producing and analyzing the phenotype of cell cycle mutants and we have demonstrated robust new cosmid-based methods for genetic complementation in this parasite. These studies will provide insight into the mechanisms regulating parasite division and provide new targets upon which to disrupt parasite proliferation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent genetic analysis of parasite virulence confirms that there is an important link between increased parasite burden and disease caused by Toxoplasma gondii. The factors that control the parasite division cycle are not understood, but it is clear that the rate of progression through the parasite cell cycle is critical to parasite numbers in the host. In this proposal, we will investigate the genetic basis for cell cycle control in Toxoplasma gondii. The essential growth factors identified in these studies will be shared by other pathogens in this family, such as Plasmodium, which causes malaria, and will likely represent novel proteins responsible for parasite growth. Therefore, through this investigation of the molecular basis of the parasite cell cycle, new potential drug targets will be identified upon which novel therapies may be developed.",Essential Cell Cycle Mechanisms In Toxoplasma,2009,2014,"White, Michael W",University of South Florida,Tampa,FL,12,1,988,1566
5R01AI096528-02,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium (S. typhimurium) causes gastroenteritis, a diarrheal illness characterized by acute intestinal inflammation. The pathogen triggers inflammation by using its virulence factors to invade the intestinal epithelium and survive in tissue macrophages. Inflammation is accompanied by changes in the luminal environment, which tip the balance in the competition between S. typhimurium and the resident microbiota in favor of the pathogen. The question of which mechanisms are responsible for these changes in the microbiota composition represents a high-impact topic that will be addressed in this application. Our central hypothesis is that inflammation generates a new respiratory electron acceptor, tetrathionate, which promotes a luminal outgrowth of S. typhimurium by enabling the pathogen to utilize compounds that cannot be further broken down by fermentation in the anaerobic environment of the gut. We will test different aspects of our hypothesis by determining whether removal of sulfide can prevent tetrathionate respiration in the gut (Aim 1), the role of energy taxis during growth in the inflamed gut (Aim 2) and whether S. typhimurium utilizes specific nutrients during inflammation (Aim 3). The proposed research will drive knowledge about gastroenteritis to a higher level by providing critical new insights into molecular mechanisms that control the balance between the pathogen, the host and its microbiota (Aims 2 and 3) and by facilitating the development of new intervention strategies through science (Aim 1). The conceptual advances resulting from the proposed work are thus expected to have a strong and sustained influence on the field.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    Non-typhoidal Salmonella serotypes are the single most common cause of death from diarrheal disease associated with viruses, parasites or bacteria and the leading cause of food-borne disease outbreaks in the United States, producing between $0.5 billion to $2.3 billion in annual costs for medical care and lost productivity. The most common human clinical isolates are Salmonella enterica serotypes Typhimurium (S. typhimurium) and Enteritidis (S. Enteritidis).

5P01HD013021-34,National Institute of Child Health and Human Development,23,"Seeinstructions): This project focuses on the role of human milk glycans as pathogen-binding inhibitors that protect against disease caused by two major viral pathogens: the noroviruses (NVs) and the rotaviruses (RVs). In the current grant cycle, we have made significant progress in defining the role of glycans, specifically those identified as histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs), as receptors for NVs. We have described eight receptor binding patterns of NVs according to the ABO, Lewis and secretor types of human HBGAs; the majority of these patterns involve substantial binding to secretor (a1, 2-fucosyl) oligosaccharide or glycoprotein moieties. We have also demonstrated inhibition of major NV strains from binding to their receptors by human milk glycans of secretor mothers (glycans with a1, 2-fucosyloligosaccharide epitopes); these glycans are HBGA analogs, and serve as decoy receptors for various strains of NVs. In this renewal we will test the secretor phenotype as a major biomarker for risk of NV diarrhea in children and the secretor phenotypes of mothers as a biomarker for protection of their breast-fed children against NV disease in our population-based cohorts. We also will examine the variation in risk among secretors with different ABO blood types. Towards development of human milk glycans as potential novel prophylactic or therapeutic agents against NV diarrhea, we will identify and characterize the specific high molecular weight (MW) glycans in human milk that have high affinity/avidity of binding to NVs. For RVs, we will follow the same pathway of investigation as used for NVs: searching for a carbohydrate receptor (fucosyl, sialyl and non-sialyl) for RVs, testing if the carbohydrate epitopes on human milk lactadherin are involved in RV recognition, and examining glycan expression in children and their mothers' milk in associationwith RV infection in children. Finally, we will perform in vitro and pre-clinical studies to design and test synthetic human milk glycan analogs and natural products as potential antivirals against NVs and RVs. RELEVANCE (See instructions): The research proposed in this application is designed to transform our fundamental understanding of human milk glycans and infant glycans in relation to risk of viral causes of diarrhea and to translate our discoveries into new medications, food substances, and diagnostic tools that promote the health and survival of infants and children worldwide.",Viral Gastroenteritis Infection,,,"Jiang, Xi ",Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr,Cincinnati,OH,41,1,-1,1509

In past research, we made significant progress towards this long-term goal and accomplished two short-term goals. (1) We identified key components in the genetic switch that activate aflatoxin gene expression and developed a comprehensive model that predicts the detailed mechanisms by which the switch regulates the timing and level of aflatoxin synthesis. (2) We identified several fungal and plant metabolites that block aflatoxin accumulation and gene expression. In the next phase of this research, we will analyze two key components of the switch mechanism in sufficient detail to identify specific steps that are susceptible to control. Using this information, we will continue to identify and test promising natural plant and fungal compounds that block aflatoxin synthesis. This research approach will allow us to confirm or modify key steps in the regulatory model and will fill a critical knowledge gap in our understanding of aflatoxin synthesis specifically and in control of complex gene clusters in general. This approach will also assist efforts to formulate and apply effective strategies to block aflatoxin synthesis on susceptible crops. Based on our model of the genetic switch, we present two central hypotheses: 1) active CRE1bp complexes recruit proteins necessary for initiation of aflatoxin gene expression (AflR and HAT); 2) the timing and level of aflatoxin gene activation is in part controlled by the initiation and spread of histone H4 acetylation in the aflatoxin gene cluster. To address these hypotheses, we propose to accomplish two Specific Aims. 1. Analyze the role of CRE1bp in aflatoxin gene activation. 2. Analyze the role of histone H4 acetylation in aflatoxin gene activation. As part of the proposed work for each specific aim, we will identify new inhibitors of aflatoxin synthesis and determine the specific mechanisms by which these and previously identified inhibitors block aflatoxin synthesis.

5R01GM043577-24,National Institute of General Medical Sciences,93,"This proposal focuses on how spores are formed by Bacillus subtilis. B. subtilis has become a paradigm for the study of spore formation, and of cell differentiation in prokaryotes, because of the ease of its genetic manipulation. All the key regulators of B. subtilis spore formation are also found in other spore forming species including the pathogens B. anthracis, Clostridium tetani, C. perfringens, C. botulinum and C. difficile, the causes of anthrax, tetanus, gas gangrene, botulism and colitis following antibiotic therapy, respectively. The highly resistant spores are critical to the survival of theses species in nature. Conclusions from a study of B. subtilis will have general validity for these species. Spore formation involves a characteristic division into two different cell types, the mother cell and the prespore. The prespore is engulfed by the mother cell and develops into the mature spore. Spore formation requires the action of four RNA polymerase factors, ?F and then ?G in the prespore and ?E and then ?K in the mother cell. It presents a fundamental problem of developmental biology: how is gene expression coordinated with morphological change? The proposal addresses this problem. When the ?F-directed signal from the prespore to activate ?E in the mother cell is delayed, a novel developmental path is taken, in which two spores are formed within one mother cell. This behavior opens up the proposed study of how chromosome replication and growth are controlled during sporulation. It facilitates a study of how genetically identical organisms in the same population can follow different developmental paths. Translocation of the chromosome into the prespore follows activation of ?F. It is proposed to study how completion of translocation leads to engulfment of the prespore by the mother cell and activation of ?G in the engulfed prespore.

We have solved the crystal structures of TgCDPK1 and CpCDPK1 and have shown the active sites are susceptible to bumped kinase inhibitors (BKI) that do not inhibit mammalian kinases.

These 'needle-like' molecular machines inject bacterial effector proteins directly into host cells for the purpose of destroying an innate immune response and facilitating bacterial replication, dissemination, and disease progression. Effector proteins are unique virulence factors in that they often capture or mimic the properties of host signal transduction molecules. One such target is the evolutionarily conserved Ras-superfamily of GTPases. The present study focuses on a recently identified bacterial type III effector family. The related type III effectors SifA, IpgB, and Map are required for Salmonella, Shigella, and enterohaemorrhagic E. coli pathogenesis, respectively, through their common ability to activate Rho-family GTPase signaling cascades. The studies described here seek to elucidate the host signaling mechanisms of this large bacterial virulence factor family by examining 1) the enzymatic activation of Rho GTPases, 2) type III effector recognition of GTPases at the molecular level, and 3) the effects of effector protein localization within the host cell. By revealing mechanistic details of type III effector family members, these studies will provide new insights into the pathogenic mechanisms o several infectious agents and into the biology of their human host.

Inhibition of the development of cancer by the administration of anticarcinogenic agents may offer practical alternatives for reducing human cancer burden. However, the successful utilization of chemopreventive interventions will require solid mechanistic understanding of the action(s) of these agents. We have identified the Keap1-Nrf2-ARE signaling pathway as a target for chemoprevention. The Nrf2 transcription factor regulates an integrated cell survival response that can be triggered by multiple classes of cancer chemopreventive agents (e.g., dithiolethiones, isothiocyanates, triterpenoids). In this project, we will use both pharmacologic and genetic approaches to further probe the molecular mechanisms of action of these chemopreventive agents, assess their efficacy in animal models with close relevance to human carcinogenesis and use these interventions to validate intermediate biomarkers. With a continuing focus on the roles of infection with hepatitis B virus and co-exposure to the fungal toxin aflatoxin on human risk for hepatocellular carcinoma, we will purse three aims. First, we will utilize advanced methods of isotope-dilution mass spectrometry for the quantitation of aflatoxin biomarkers in liver, blood, urine and feces in order to develop for the first time a comprehensive mass balance for the fate of the ultimate carcinogen, exo-aflatoxin-epoxide, in rats. The predictive value of these biomarkers for individual risk of liver cancer will be assessed. Biomarkers will be quantified longitudinally during a bioassay for protection against hepatocarcinogenesis by the exceptionally potent triterpenoid activator of Nrf2 signaling, CDDO-Im. We will also evaluate the predictive value of monitoring DNA circulating in plasma for mutations in target oncogenes using quantitative short oligonucleotide mass spectrometry. In the second aim, we will evaluate the similarities and distinctions of chemical class, species and genetic activation of Keap1-Nrf2 signaling by comparing the gene expression patterns in rat and mouse liver following treatment with lead compounds of 3 different chemical classes of Nrf2 activators at doses equi-effective for inhibition of aflatoxin-induced preneoplastic lesions and by comparing the gene expression patterns in liver of mice in which either Nrf2 or its repressor Keap1 have been genetically disrupted. The impact of these genetic and pharmacologic interventions on aflatoxin disposition will be determined using the mass spectrometry-based analysis of its biomarkers. Third, we will capitalize on our novel observation that Nrf2 signaling influences tissue regeneration and repair by examining the post initiation effects of triterpenoids during aflatoxin-induced hepatocarcinogenesis in the rat and in a murine model recapitulating major human risk factors for HCC, namely, aflatoxin exposure and infection with HBV.

Associated with that outbreak were large  numbers of hospitalizations and deaths. Based on this potential to cause large-scale epidemics,  Cryptosporidium has been classified as a Class B agent for biodefense. According to the World Health  Organization, diarrheal diseases are the second most common cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide  among children in developing countries and also an important cause of morbidity and mortality in adults,  Parasites are more common agents of persistent and chronic diarrhea, which are increasingly recognized as  major causes of chronic morbidity.

Paradoxically, allowing pathogen persistence may also be beneficial for the host when immune-mediated damage outweigh the immediate risk posed by the infection. Our long-term goals are to identify the immune cells and signals activated during Salmonella infection that controls this balance between immune activation required for pathogen eradication with the associated risk of immune-mediated host injury, and immune suppression at the expense of pathogen persistence. The mouse model of S. typhimurium infection reproduces important features of persistent infection characteristic of human typhoid. Together with the abundance of immunological tools and reagents available only in mice, infection in this species is currently the best-available model for identifying the molecular and cellular signals that control this delicate immunological balance. Using this model, our preliminary studies indicate regulatory T cells (Tregs) that comprise a distinct lineage of CD4+ T cells characterized by Foxp3-expression play critical roles in dictating the balance between immune activation and bacterial persistence. Early after infection, Foxp3+Treg-ablation accelerates the kinetics of bacterial eradication, while augmenting Foxp3+Tregs causes reciprocal increases in pathogen burden. Therefore the overall goals of this application are to define the relative importance and identify the suppressive mechanism utilized by Tregs throughout persistent Salmonella infection. Aim 1 will expand on our preliminary findings that demonstrate drastic changes in Treg suppressive potency for cells isolated at early (day 5) and late (day 37) time points, by defining a comprehensive kinetic analysis for changes in Treg suppressive potency during persistent infection. Our specific goals are to identify when Treg suppressive potency peaks, nadirs, and returns to baseline levels, and the absolute magnitude for these changes. These results will establish the frame-work for complementary experiments that verify the importance of Tregs at these critical time points by quantifying the relative impacts of Treg-ablation. Using recently developed techniques for reconstituting Treg- ablated mice with donor Tregs from mice with targeted defects in defined Treg-associated molecules, Aim 2 will further explore the mechanistic basis for these changes in Treg suppression potency. These include experiments that will identify and dissociate the specific Treg-associated molecules that control host defense from those required for sustaining peripheral immune tolerance, and define Salmonella ligands and the corresponding pattern recognition receptors that dictate these changes in Treg suppression potency through cell-intrinsic stimulation. Together these experiments that utilize cutting edge immunological tools will not only fill important gaps in our current knowledge on the importance and the mechanism whereby Foxp3+Tregs control host defense during Salmonella infection, but also establish important paradigms for how Tregs may regulate immunity during other persistent infections.

To  these ends, we have assembled an international collaborative team to systematically address the etiologies  of a number of acute human illnesses using cutting edge molecular genomic approaches combined with  classical immunological, virologic and epidemiologic methods. In this project, we will focus primarily on three  diseases, encephalitis, respiratory tract infection, and gastroenteritis, which are collectively responsible for  approximately 6,000,000 deaths annually. The most comprehensive analyses fail to identify and etiologic  agent in 70% of encephalitis, -30% of respiratory tract infection and -40% of gastroenteritis. In addition, the  emergence of new infectious agents, many of which manifest the clinical symptoms characteristic of these  diseases, accentuates the critical need to define the complete spectrum of viruses capable of causing these  diseases. In this proposal we present an integrated pipeline for identification of novel viruses,  characterization of these viruses, and definition of their biological relevance. To identify novel viruses, two  complementary genomic methodologies, pan-viral DNA microarrays and mass sequencing, will be applied to  analyze clinical specimens in a highly comprehensive and minimally biased fashion. These methods have  been previously used to identify SARS as a novel coronavirus during the 2003 outbreak, the novel WU  polyomavirus and multiple novel viruses in stool from diarrhea patients. We will determine the genomic  structure and biological relevance of novel viruses using molecular, epidemiological, and  seroepidemiological criteria.

In vitro methods (including fluorescence monitored metal uptake kinetics) will be complemented by an analysis of processes and proteins required for metal binding by manganese metalloenzymes in vivo. This work is fundamental to understanding the role of manganese trafficking in human health and disease. Further, understanding the metal binding mechanism of the ubiquitous antioxidant metalloenzyme MnSOD may contribute new insight into biological defenses against oxidative stress, a key factor in aging and neurodegenerative disorders. This work may also shed light on diseases of metal homeostasis in which metal misincorporation occurs. Roles of manganese in pathogenesis will be explored through the expression and molecular characterization of manganese catalase homologs mined from the genome of a medically important microbial pathogen, the enterohaemorraghic E. coli O157:H7. Further, the role of high-valent manganese complexes in enzyme catalysis will be investigated by applying a combination of advanced spectroscopic methods and rapid kinetics to probe the active site chemistry of oxalate oxidase. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Manganese is an element that plays many essential roles in health and disease. One of the important aims of this proposal is to investigate how living cells specifically deliver manganese to manganese-dependent enzymes so that they can perform their biological functions, providing important new insight into processes underlying aging and neurodegenerative disorders. The role of manganese in the virulence of the foodborne pathogen, E. coli O157:H7, will also be explored, and the mechanisms of manganese catalysis will be investigated in oxalate oxidase, an enzyme that is important in clinical bioanalytical chemistry.",Manganese Redox Biochemistry,1989,2014,"Whittaker, James W",Oregon Health & Science University,Portland,OR,43,1,132,-1
5R01HD061929-04,National Institute of Child Health and Human Development,23,"Human milk contains a remarkable content and structural diversity of oligosaccharides (HMO) that act as a component of the innate immunity by preventing attachment of pathogens to the intestinal lining and by promoting colonization by a healthy microbiota. Despite their recognized importance in neonatal health, research on HMO has been hindered by insufficient quantities to conduct feeding studies. Our long range goal is to understand the mechanisms whereby HMO stimulates neonatal innate and adaptive immunity. We are ideally positioned to undertake these investigations as we have access to large quantities of enzymatically synthesized lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT) and human milk from which to extract HMO. The objective of this application is to determine how HMO, LNnT, polydextrose and galactooligosaccharide (PDX/GOS) influence activation of dendritic cells (DC) and lymphocyte responses to vaccination against rotavirus (RV) and a subsequent RV challenge in the piglet model. Our central hypothesis is that HMO will enhance immune function by two inter-related mechanisms by directly interacting with DCs and, indirectly, by altering the intestinal microbiota. First, we postulate that HMO glycans interact with c-type lectin receptors on DC, which induce in DC activation and activation of B- and T-lymphocytes. Second, we hypothesize that HMO will promote the growth of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, leading to fermentation of oligosaccharides and enhanced mucosal resistance to RV infection. The specific aims will 1) assess the potential for HMO, LNnT and PDX/GOS to be fermented, to stimulate DC activation and to inhibit RV infectivity and binding in vitro, 2) evaluate the prebiotic actions of oligosaccharides on microbial colonization, mucosal immunity and the response RV vaccination in the piglet, and 3) establish how oligosaccharides alone or in combination with vaccination modulate the response to RV infection in the piglet. The rationale for undertaking this research is that no previous studies have systematically investigated how HMO, LNnT and synthetic prebiotics modulate the microbiota and mucosal immunity. The use of relevant preclinical animal model of RV vaccination and challenge that will further our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the disease and demonstrate the potential for HMOs to improve intestinal function, modulate host-microbe interactions and alter mucosal immunity.

5U19AI070235-07,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Allergic disorders are a major global health burden affecting up to 40% of the world population. Common  biologic pathways underlie allergic diseases such as asthma, AD, FA and EE with the epithelium being a  link. Indeed, epithelial cells are increasingly recognized as critical participants in the pathogenesis of allergic  inflammation. As such, studies are needed to further elucidate the epithelial genes and pathways that  contribute to allergic inflammation. This is underscored by the fact that there is currently no asthma therapy  that specifically targets the epithelium. In the last cycle of funding, we utilized a novel unbiased strategy,  which combined expression profiling of nasal epithelial cells from patients with asthma, population  differences in asthma prevalence, and genetic association studies, to identify epithelial genes that  contributed to childhood asthma. We identified several epithelial genes with previously unrecognized roles in  asthma. Further analyses of these genes suggest that some of these genes are specific to one epithelial  surface and are associated with one allergic disease, while others are common to multiple epithelial surfaces  and allergic disorders. Collectively, our data suggest that depending on the target organ/mucosal surface,  there are common and distinct epithelial genes and pathways that contribute to allergic inflammation. The  Identification of the epithelial genes and pathways, which predispose individuals to specific or shared allergic  disorders, will empower the search for novel therapeutics aimed specifically at the epithelial surface, and the  development of treatment strategies that are optimized for allergic disorders alone and/or in combination. In  the prior cycle, we studied children with asthma and/or AR. In this application, we propose to extend our  genetic approach to test the hypothesis that allergy-driven epithelial genes Identified in the prior cycle of  funding (SERPINB3/4, KIF3A, DNAH5, SPRR2B, ADCY2, PDE4B, PLAU, EGFR) will demonstrate unique  and overlapping associations with asthma, atopic dermatitis, and/or food allergy in children and that the  genetic contribution of these genes is modified by epistatic interactions with epithelial genes critical in  maintaining the integrity of the mucosal barrier and/or promoting Th2 responses.",Genetics Of Epithelial Genes In Childhood Asthma,,,"Khurana Hershey, Gurjit K.",Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr,Cincinnati,OH,41,1,-1,-1
5R01AI091536-02,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) causes one of the most common opportunistic infections in patients with AIDS. Disseminated HCMV infection in these patients is usually associated with gastroenteritis, pneumonia, and sight-threatening retinitis. The emergence of drug-resistant HCMV strains to currently available drugs (e.g. ganciclovir) has posed a need to develop new drugs and novel strategies to combat HCMV infections. The objective of this study is to develop Salmonella as a novel class of gene transfer vectors for targeted delivery of anti-HCMV RNase P ribozymes for blocking viral infection. Attenuated strains of Salmonella can function as a carrier system for the delivery of eukaryotic expression vectors and have been shown to deliver therapeutic agents, including nucleic acids-based vaccines and anti-tumor molecules (e.g. small interfering RNAs) for the treatment and prevention of human diseases. We have recently shown that attenuated Salmonella efficiently delivered an anti-HCMV RNase P ribozyme sequence to human cells, leading to substantial ribozyme expression and effective inhibition of viral infection. Furthermore, we have generated novel attenuated Salmonella strains that efficiently delivered RNase P ribozyme sequence for expression in cells. However, little is currently known about the mechanism of how Salmonella achieves efficient gene transfer for delivery of nucleic acids-based agents (e.g. RNase P ribozymes) in human cells. It has not been reported if Salmonella-mediated delivery of RNase P ribozymes is specific and effective in inhibiting viral infection and pathogenesis in animal models. To address these issues, we propose to first study how the generated Salmonella strains achieve efficient gene transfer. We will then investigate whether targeted delivery of RNase P ribozyme by the generated Salmonella abolishes HCMV gene expression and growth in cultured human cells. Using murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection of mice as a model system, we will determine whether the generated Salmonella strains are highly efficient for targeted delivery of RNase P ribozyme in animals and whether the targeted delivery of RNase P ribozymes mediated by Salmonella is highly effective in blocking MCMV infection and pathogenesis in vivo. The potential immune/inflammatory responses and cytotoxicity associated with the generated Salmonella strains will also be investigated. Our research will generate novel Salmonella strains with efficient gene transfer activity that can be used in gene-targeting clinical applications. Furthermore, these results will provide insight into the mechanism of how Salmonella achieves efficient gene delivery in mammalian cells, and will determine whether Salmonella-mediated delivery of RNase P ribozymes is specific and effective in shutting down gene expression in cultured cells and in animals. This study will facilitate the development of Salmonella-mediated delivery of RNase P ribozymes as a novel therapeutic approach for treatment of infections by HCMV and other AIDS-associated viruses.",Bacteria Based Agents For Therapy Of AIDS Associated Infections,2011,2015,"Lu, Sangwei ",University of California Berkeley,Berkeley,CA,6,1,-1,1700

Building upon a background in nutrition and epidemiology, the mentored phase of this award will provide training in 1) study management and oversight, 2) advanced nutritional biochemistry and the mathematical modeling of one-carbon metabolism, and 3) laboratory sciences. The acquired skills will be applied to the current area of research, investigating the influence of nutrients involved in one-carbon metabolism on the methylation of both arsenic (As) and genomic DNA. Specifically, the roles of two nutrients, choline and betaine - i.e. key nutrients involved in methylation pathways - which have not previously been considered in relation to As and DNA methylation, will be examined. Roughly 140 million people in over 70 countries are chronically exposed to As- contaminated drinking water at concentrations far exceeding the World Health Organization standard of 10 &#191;g/L. As is a class I carcinogen known to cause cancers of the skin, bladder, and lung, as well as ischemic heart disease and neurologic impairments. Methylation of ingested inorganic arsenic (InAs) to methylarsonic- (MMA) and dimethylarsinic acids (DMA) relies on nutrient-dependent one carbon metabolism and facilitates urinary As elimination. Methylation of DNA via one-carbon metabolism is an epigenetic modification that plays critical roles in the regulation of gene expression and maintenance of chromosomal stability, and may play a role in the underlying mechanism of As-induced carcinogenesis. In the mentored phase, the influence of choline and betaine on methylation of As and DNA will be investigated in an existing cross-sectional study of 375 Bangladeshi adults exposed to a wide range of As concentrations in drinking water. In the independent phase, the skills acquired during the training will be applied to further investigate the roles of choline and betaine, including their interactions with other nutrients, i.e. folate and creatine, in the methylation of both As and DNA utilizing data and biospecimens from a randomized controlled trial of 600 individuals chronically exposed to As. In addition, mathematical models of one-carbon metabolism will be employed to conduct in silico experiments in conjunction with the clinical trial. These experiments will 1) allow the models to be further validated against the clinical trial data and 2) provide a deeper mechanistic understanding of the results from the trial. At the conclusion of this award, Dr. Hall will have developed into an independent multidisciplinary investigator well positioned to develop additional hypotheses related to the role of nutrient/environment interactions in disease development.",Nutrients Involved 1-Carbon Metabolism And The Methylation Of Arsenic And DNA,2010,2015,"Hall, Megan Nina",Columbia University Health Sciences,New York,NY,37,1,-1,3491

The pathogenesis of Listeriosis and Shigellosis absolutely requires these intracellular bacteria to usurp the host cell's contractile system to form membrane projections, called filopodia. Filopodia push into adjacent cells where they are ingested, allowing efficient cell-to-cell to spread and avoidance of the humoral immune system, as well as many antibiotics. The actin regulatory proteins and pathways that mediate bacteria-induced filopodia formation are poorly understood. We will: Aim I - Explore the relative contribution of known actin-regulatory proteins to Listeria- and Shigella-induced filopodia formation. Immuno-fluorescence and immuno-gold electron microscopy, expression of GFP fusion proteins, RNAi, and knockout cell lines will be combined with freeze fracture electron microscopy, fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching (FRAP), and laser nano-scissors to assess the roles of the actin-regulatory proteins Eps8, VASP , Arp2/3 complex, fascin, and myosin-X in filopodia formation. Aim II - Dissect the signal transduction pathways that initiate Listeria-induced filopodia formation. The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 blocks Listeria-induced filopodia formation, and delivery of PIP3 results in a > 6 x increase in filopodia number without a significant change in Listeria intracellular motility. Using targeted RNAi knockdown, the specific PI3K isotype responsible for initiating filopodia formation will be determined. The role of the downstream affecters Akt, PKC-gamma, Tapp-1 and Plekstrin-2, GAPs, GEFs, and small G-proteins will be examined. Filopodia formation in response to changes in [Ca2+]i is being assessed by Fura-2 and BAPTAM, and we find a > 2x increase in filopodia length following Ca2+ chelation. The effects of polyamine calcium channel agonist and antagonists on Listeria cell-to-cell spread will be explored. These investigations promise to clarify the key regulatory pathways required for Listeria- and Shigella-induced filopodia formation and cell-to-cell spread, critical steps for virulence and new therapeutic approaches. These discoveries can be applied to all forms of cell motility, including tumor metastasis, neurite outgrowth, and platelet spreading.

5P01AI054456-08,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):  The TIM gene family was identified using a congenic mouse model in which polymorphisms in TIM-1  and TIM-3 wre associated with Th1-Th2 differentiation and allergen-induced ainway hyperreactivity (AHR) between BALB/c and congenic HBA mice. The long-term goals of Project 3 are to understand how the Tim genes regulate peripheral tolerance, adaptive immune responses, and allergy. In the previous grant period we showed that TIM-1 is an important costimulatory molecule for T cells, that TIM-1 and TIM-4 modulate T cell responses and the development of tolerance, and that TIM-1 and TIM-4 are receptors for phosphatidylserine (PtdSer), a key molecule for recognition and uptake of apoptotic cells. We have found that TIM-3, expressed on Th1 cells and APC, is also a receptor for PtdSer and that the allelic variants of TIM-3 associated with asthma differ in their recognition of PtdSer. These results together suggest a new paradigm for TIM proteins as PtdSer receptors that by regulating the recognition and clearance of apoptotic cells, can regulate tissue homeostasis, T cell responses and the induction of peripheral tolerance.  In Specific Aim 1 we will determine the mechanisms by which TIM-4 expressed on APC, and TIM-1,  expressed on activated T cells and Th2 cells, regulate oral tolerance and prevent food allergy. We will  examine mechanisms by which TIM-4 blockade inhibits oral tolerance induction. In Specific Aim 2, we will characterize the cell types and APC subset(s) in the lamina propria and mesenteric lymph node that express TIM-4, the conditions that modulate expression of TIM-3 and TIM-4 following exposure to danger signals such as bacterial products that initiate food allergy. We will examine the consequences of T cell interaction with TIM-expressing APC on T cell subset differentiation. In Specific Aim 3 we will investigate the role of TIM-3 polymorphic variants, which we have recently shown differ in recognition of apoptotic cells, in modulation of immune responses in BALB/c and HBA mice, and determine the roles of TIM-1 and TIM-3 in modulating the development of airway hyperreactivity in these strains.  We have developed unique reagents that will enable us to accomplish these goals. We have  generated panels of anti-TIM-1 and TIM-4 mAbs, we have generated TIM-4 and TIM-1 transgenic mice, and TlM-1 deficient mice are now breeding in our colony. Our laboratory has extensive experience in the study of tolerance as a mechanism that protects against Th2-driven immune responses and in the study of dendritic cells (DCs) and antigen-specific CD4+ Tpeg cells. These studies will greatly improve our understanding of immune regulation and lead to new therapies for inflammatory diseases.","TIM-1, TIM-3 And TIM-4: A Gene Family That Regulates Tolerance And Immunity",,,"Dekruyff, Rosemarie H",Children's Hospital Corporation,Boston,MA,26,1,-1,-1
5R01AI083405-03,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"A successful cellular immune response to Toxoplasma gondii and many other intracellular pathogens involves a delicate balance between the actions of IL-12, a pro- inflammatory innate cytokine triggered by the parasite and IL-10, a regulatory cytokine produced by adaptive T cells to prevent immunopathology. The overall goal of this proposal is to explore how IL-12 controls the generation and persistence of parasite- reactive CD8 effector and memory cells required for protective immunity and how IL-10 acts in a novel autocrine fashion to avert tissue damage. Using a new mouse model with T-cell lineage specific interference in IL-10 signaling, we have obtained evidence that IL- 10 activation of a T-cell intrinsic anti-inflammatory response is required to prevent morbidity and mortality during T. gondii infection. We will use this transgenic and other knockout mouse models to elucidate the kinetics, regulation and functional consequences of IL-10 responsiveness during the Th1 response to T. gondii and explore a novel mechanism for how IL-10 cell-autonomously restrains Th1 cytokine responses. We have recently described four subpopulations of CD8 cells induced by immunization with the cps-vaccine strain of T. gondii and have published evidence that IL-12 is critically required for the generation of effector CD8 T cells expressing IFN3, granzyme B and KLRG1. In collaboration with Dr. Hidde Ploegh's laboratory at MIT, we have identified the first Kb-restricted CTL epitope from T. gondii and our collaborators have also developed a cloned mouse line bearing monoclonal naove CD8 T cells reactive to this Kb- restricted T. gondii antigen. Using these new mouse and immunological reagents, we will elucidate the cytokine requirements, lineage relationships and functional significance of the heterogenous CD8 T cell subsets induced by T. gondii vaccination and infection. We will critically assess the costs and benefits of IL-12 signaling on the immediate and recall CD8 protective response to re-infection.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Disease caused by parasitic protozoa and other intracellular microbial agents are major causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Morbidity and mortality may be caused by immunodeficiency leading to tissue destruction by the parasites or these may result from an overzealous or dysregulated immune response. The studies proposed here will provide new insights into how potentially pathogenic Th1 cells are restrained and how protective CD8 T cells are generated and maintained over the long term, specifically with respect to how cytokines control these immune processes.

How the spleen's unique tissue structure and the diverse mixture of resident myeloid and lymphoid cells work together in vivo to combat infection remains poorly understood. We expect the native tissue environment to regulate immune cell function in complex and profound ways and therefore in vivo imaging approaches are a crucial complement biochemical and in vitro studies. Using two-photon microscopy and a robust histological analysis, we propose to investigate early phagocyte clearance mechanisms, analyze the trafficking of splenic phagocytes and the role of chemokine signaling in spleen remodeling, and identify the antigen presenting cells (APCs) and tissue microenvironment involved in presenting bacteria-specific antigen to T cells. Our overall goal is to understand how spleen structure impacts immune function. Our hypothesis is that early host-pathogen interactions in the marginal zone induce bactericidal responses in some cells, while in others, those interactions trigger cell migration to the appropriate tissue microcompartments for antigen presentation. Our studies will use the well characterized Listeria model of bacterial infection, in which splenic infection leads to T cell priming and induces long-lasting immunity. The proposed studies will enhance our fundamental understanding of how the spleen responds to blood-borne bacteria and provide a framework for future studies of other more virulent human pathogens. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The spleen is the largest collection of lymphocytes in the human body and plays an important role in immunity to bacteria.

5F32AI093271-02,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Toxoplasma gondii is an intracellular protozoan parasite that represents a major threat to immunocompromised individuals, including AIDS patients, newborns with a congenital infection, and organ transplant recipients. Toxoplasma is a permanent infection that evades the host immune response because the acute form (tachyzoite) can develop into a latent cyst form (bradyzoite) in response to stress. We wish to address the mechanisms by which Toxoplasma detects cellular stresses and triggers differentiation into the cyst form. A well characterized stress response pathway conserved in eukaryotic cells involves translational control by virtue of the phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor-2 (eIF21). When eIF21 is phosphorylated at its regulatory serine (serine-51), global translation initiation is dampened, decreasing the synthesis of the current proteome so the cell can conserve energy and reprogram gene transcription to remedy the stress. We have demonstrated that the eIF21 homolog in Toxoplasma (TgIF21) is phosphorylated in response to a variety of cellular stresses, including stress conditions that induce cyst formation. Additionally, TgIF21 remains highly phosphorylated in bradyzoite cyst forms that are induced in vitro, and pharmacological inhibition of eIF21 dephosphorylation induced the expression of bradyzoite specific genes and promoted mature cyst formation in vitro. We recently made transgenic parasites that cannot phosphorylate the regulatory serine reside (Ser71) of TgIF21 in a type I (RH) strain. The RH TgIF21-S71A mutant parasites demonstrated that TgIF21 phosphorylation is critical for viability because they are ill-equipped to cope with exposure to the extracellular environment upon lysis of the host cell. Therefore, we hypothesize that TgIF21 kinases are critical for persistence of both acute and chronic infections by allowing Toxoplasma to adapt to environmental stresses. To address this hypothesis, in AIM 1 we will systematically create knockouts for each of the four Toxoplasma eIF21 kinases (TgIF2K-A through D) in a type I background. These novel mutants will allow us to dissect the function of each eIF21 kinase in responding to a diverse set of cellular stresses in tachyzoites, with an eye for future drug targets. In Aim 2, we will create a type II parasite strain that is incapable of TgIF21 phosphorylation by converting the regulatory Ser71 to Ala. The type II TgIF21-S71A will establish the role of stress-induced TgIF21 phosphorylation on Toxoplasma development and cyst latency.",Stress Responses In The AIDS Opportunistic Parasite Toxoplasma Gondii,2011,2013,"Joyce, Brad R",Indiana Univ-Purdue Univ At Indianapolis,Indianapolis,IN,18,1,-1,-1

Invasion of the intestinal mucosa by the infectious amoeba trophozoites depends on a dynamic cytoskeleton that is regulated by Rho family GTPases. The Siderovski lab has recently identified the first functional heterotrimeric G proteins (EhG123) and a regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) domain-containing Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) from the E. histolytica genome. My own preliminary data indicates that EhRGS-RhoGEF binds EhG1 in a nucleotide-dependent manner and accelerates the latter protein's GTPase activity. A heterotrimeric G protein signaling pathway, similar to the G112/13 pathway in mammals, likely regulates Rho GTPase activity and thus intestinal invasion by E. histolytica. Furthermore, G protein signaling pathways frequently provide excellent drug targets.  In Specific Aim 1, the molecular components of this G protein signaling pathway will be determined by identifying a Rho GTPase substrate for EhRGS-RhoGEF. Biochemical and structural mechanisms for their activation wil be elucidated, using nucleotide exchange assays and X-ray crystallography, respectively. Specific Aim 2 will determine roles for EhG1 and EhRGS-RhoGEF in amoebic intestinal invasion and destruction. The proposed experiments will test whether over- or under-expression of either protein alters the ability of trophozoites to cap surface receptors, invade extracelular matrix, kil intestinal epithelial cels, or invade the intestinal walls of infected mice.

He plans a successful career as an independent translational investigator in the multidisciplinary fields of immunology, epidemiology and statistical modeling. His long-term research goal is to identify effective interventions to optimize a population's natural and vaccine-acquired immunity to diarrhea-inducing enteric viruses like rotavirus (RV) and norovirus (NoV) and thereby protect children from diarrhea. ENVIRONMENT: Drs. Reynaldo Martorell and Usha Ramakrishnan, two established, NIH-funded leaders in global nutritional epidemiology will mentor Dr. Leon. BACKGROUND: Newly introduced RV vaccines could have a significant impact on preventing childhood diarrhea, a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. We postulate that child nutrition, with other susceptibility (e.g. maternal influences like breastfeeding) and exposure (e.g. socio-demographic) factors, directly modulate immune-competence, including RV vaccine-acquired immune-competence. Adequate immune-competence, in turn, protects a child from diarrhea. This five-year mentored K01 research proposal will test this model through epidemiologic and statistical modeling approaches to quantify the combined effects of nutrition, immune-competence, and RV vaccination on pediatric diarrhea. SPECIFIC AIMS: 1) To understand how immune-competence and nutrition influence pediatric diarrhea. 2) To identify the mechanisms through which nutrition affects immunecompetence. 3) To quantify the influence of severe malnutrition and immune-competence on RV infection and diarrhea after RV vaccination. TRAINING: Dr. Leon will complement his strong laboratory immunology background with mentored training in epidemiologic and statistical modeling. He will be trained, in Aim 1-2, at Emory University, through coursework and by studying clinical specimens and data from an ongoing cohort study, at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Publica in Mexico, of over 800 Mexican mothers-infant pairs. He will also acquire mentored field experience in the design and execution of prospective cohort studies. He will be trained, in Aim 3, at the Rotavirus Surveillance Vaccine Program in Bolivia, by recruiting and collecting data and specimens from over 200 infants for one year after RV vaccination. RELEVANCE: Models to test the combined effect of these fixed and modifiable risk factors could provide much needed and timely scientific evidence for pediatric diarrhea interventions and global rotavirus vaccination policy.

5U54AI057160-09,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"This is a continuation of RP6 of the prior MRCE program, now presented as RP5 of a PPG (RP4-RP8) to  analyze the mechanisms responsible for the broad spectrum activities of interferons (IFNs) against priority  pathogens. While much is known about IFN signaling, less is known about the IFN-induced effector  mechanisms that control infection. We speculate that direct manipulation of specific IFN effector  mechanisms may provide broad protection without the toxicity associated with IFN administration. Our goal  was two-pronged: (i) to discover novel IFN-induced antiviral molecules, and (ii) to define their importance,  biochemistry, and mechanisms. We identified ISG15 as an IFN-induced anti-viral molecule, proved it's broad  antiviral role, identified host proteins and ISG15 residues essential for its antiviral function, and identified a  novel immune evasion strategy used by several viruses including Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus  to counter ISG15-and ubiquitin-dependent innate immunity. While analyzing ISG15, we continued the  discovery process, identifying the autophagy gene ATG5 as essential for IFNy-induced control of infection  with Listeria monocytogenes (LM), Toxoplasma gondii (TG), and murine norovirus (MNV). We propose to  continue this two two-prong approach to mechanism and discovery through the following Aims:  Aim 1: IFN-induced effector molecule mechanisms: Focus on autophagy.  1a) Assess the generality of the importance of Atg5 and Atg7 in control of infection with priority pathogens.  1b) Determine whether autophagy proteins Atg5 and Atg7 are required for IFNa-mediated inhibition of  viral growth.  1c) Define the mechanisms responsible for the importance of Atg5/7/autophagy in IFN-induced control  of pathogen replication.  1d) Identify signaling mechanisms by which IFNy regulates autophagy.  Aim 2: IFN-induced effector molecule identification.  2a) Define the transcriptional signature of IFNa and IFNy in primary macrophages.  2b) Screen candidate IFN-induced effector molecules for antiviral activities in vivo and in vitro.  2c) Generate and analyze mice lacking candidate antiviral molecules.",Novel Interferon Dependent Innate Antiviral Mechanisms,,,"Virgin, Herbert W",Washington University,Saint Louis,MO,30,1,2,-1

During this critical time, in utero and early postnatal exposure to toxicants has the potential to affect gene expression, altering organ structure and physiological function. However, only limited attention has been paid to the effects of environmentally relevant exposures to toxicants during these critical periods of development. Inorganic arsenic is a ubiquitous environmental toxicant, found in high concentrations throughout the world. Drinking water exposures to high levels of arsenic either in utero or during early childhood development led to an increased risk of dying from lung cancers and chronic lung disease in adults. Our own work in animal models has demonstrated that following in utero and early postnatal exposure to arsenic, airway response to methacholine was increased in a dose dependent manner. This change appears to be permanent and the response is specific for the early developmental exposure. While exposures from ingestion of arsenic can lead to alterations, the inhalation route of exposure is also relevant to the lung. In utero and/or postnatal exposure to cigarette smoke, ambient urban air particles or metals leads to increased airway reactivity, decreased surface to volume ratios in the lung and altered lung function in the offspring. Therefore, we  hypothesize that inhalation of dusts containing arsenic during sensitive developmental times will result in altered pulmonary function and structure in adults. The evaluation of the direct effects of inhaled arsenic and the potential interactions of inhaled arsenic and ingested arsenic will be the emphasis of this project. We will evaluate four aims. The first three Aims will define sensitive exposure times necessary to produce alterations in lung structure and function in the offspring: Aim 1 will examine the effects of inhalation of arsenic and arsenic containing particles to pregnant mice (in utero exposure); Aim 2 will examine the effects of early postnatal exposures to these compounds and Aim 3 will examine the effect of combined in utero and postnatal exposures.

This focus reflects the situational analysis ofthe region suggesting: a) substantial morbidity and mortality from NCCRDs, b) a significant role of environmental and/or occupational exposures in the causation of a large fraction of NCCRDs, and, c) the high potential for successful public health interventions among those NCCRDs in which environmental and occupational exposures play key roles. Our strategies for achieving the goal of region-wide strengthening of research capacity in NCCRDs focus on: a) the long-term, comprehensive training of individuals who will become future leaders of research on NCCRDs in their home countries; b) the building of institutional capacity through a combination of strengthening of mentoring skills of faculty of the lead academic institutions, and development and dissemination of research training materials using state-of-the-art distance learning methodologies; and c) strengthening an alliance of academic institutions with governmental organizations responsible for evidence-based policy implementation. Specific methods to achieve these objectives include: a) fully supporting 12 doctoral students enrolled in 4 South African universities including tuition, stipend, direct support of dissertation research, and a 4-month intensive program of study in translational research at the University of Michigan; b) bringing 10 Southem African research mentors for 4 months to the University of Michigan for an intensive program to increase mentoring and research skills; c) development of distance learning modules as an open access research training resource; and, d) provision of focused short courses in southern Africa.

5R01MD005819-03,National Institute On Minority Health and Health Disparities,-1,"Project Summary The risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a leading cause of death in humans infected with hepatitis virus (HV), is significantly enhanced by dietary exposure to aflatoxin (AF). Also, the carcinogenicity of AF can be promoted with exposure to fumonisin (FB), a common co-contaminant with AF. Importantly, a significant increase in HCC in Texas has been documented in multiple regions of the San Antonio metropolitan area of Bexar County. In a pilot study, we have shown this population is at risk for AF/FB exposure due to the intake of contaminated foods. Thus, innovative strategies for the prevention of HV/AF/FB-induced HCC are high priorities. We have developed a novel approach using a smectite clay (NS) that selectively sorbs AF and FB in the GI tract. In clinical trials in Texas and Ghana, we confirmed the safety and efficacy of NS. In the proposed project, our aims are based on the central hypothesis that intervention with NS will decrease AF/FB exposure in study participants in Bexar County. Our objectives focus on confirming the molecular mechanisms of refined NS and investigating its ability to diminish the incidence of preneoplastic hepatic lesions in a rodent model. Also, biomarkers of toxin exposure will be measured in samples from participants following a 3-month clinical trial. We postulate that this agent will reduce primary exposure to AF/FB and, in turn, reduce the incidence of HCC in vulnerable commumnities in Texas. Between 2002 and 2006, the incidence of HCV infection and HCC in populations in Bexar County was significantly higher compared to other counties in Texas. Therefore, in these populations at risk for HCC, it is desirable to decrease dietary exposure to AF/FB. Mitigating AF/FB exposure using a toxin enterosorbent (i.e., NS clay) represents an innovative, practical, sustainable and environmentally benign approach. Moreover, this strategy is ground-breaking in that a refined smectite clay can be used to decrease the bioavailability of a potent cancer initiator (AF) as well as a potent cancer promoter (FB) by preferentially and tightly sequestering both toxins from the GI tract. The preferred delivery of a therapeutic dose of NS clay may eventually be through its inclusion in common foods such as peanut butter, corn meal, tortillas, or salt (like iodine).",Prevention Of Hepatocellular Carcinoma In Vulnerable Communities In Texas,2010,2014,"Phillips, Timothy ",Texas A&m University,College Station,TX,51,1,-1,3438

The bacterium causes rapid septicemia after consumption of contaminated seafood (especially raw oysters), predominantly in persons with liver dysfunction. Among food-bourne pathogens, V. vulnificus is most notable for its high rates of hospitalization and death. Indeed, V. vulnificus accounts for 1% of deaths from food-bourne illness despite causing only 0.003% of illnesses. Although infections are rare, the number of serious infections has been increasing in recent years, possibly due to global warming that has caused a rise in the number of days amenable to growth of V. vulnificus in coastal waters. Attempts by the FDA to protect consumers by implementation of post-harvest processing mandates met with significant resistance from the shellfish harvesting industry forcing the FDA to review its policies. Thus, the study of V. vulnificus pathogenesis has become a food safety and public policy priority. Recent studies establish that cytotoxicity of V. vulnificus is predominantly associated with a large Multifunctional-Autoprocessing RTX toxin (MARTXVv). In this study, we demonstrate that this toxin is directly linked to pathogenesis by the intragastric route of infection, although its targets in vivo and molecular mechanism of action remain unknown. We propose to study the role of the MARTXVv toxin in pathogenesis using in vivo, cell culture, and biochemical systems.

5R01AI065967-08,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) is the most potent biological toxin known, the cause of the paralytic disease, botulism, and a potential bioterrorist weapon. Passive immunization with antibody therapeutics is considered to be the ideal countermeasure for a BoNT exposure, and the safest of these would be composed of human monoclonal antibodies. An important obstacle to the production of an effective antibody therapeutic strategy for BoNT is that BoNT exists in at least 7 serotypes, and most of the antibodies cloned thus far are not able to bind more than one serotype. In addition, effective neutralization requires that triplet combinations of antibodies be employed, so that neutralization of 3 toxin serotypes would require at least 9 distinct antibodies. This project addresses this problem by exploring a platform for the creation of human monoclonal antibody therapeutics capable of binding and neutralizing three distinct serotypes of BoNT, A, B, and E. The foundation of the plan is a hybridoma method of human antibody cloning that has generated a number of cross-reactive antibodies. This is combined with a novel means of increasing the in vivo potency of BoNT antibodies using a fusion peptide that may increase the rate of clearance of BoNT from the bloodstream. An important aspect of the study is an ultra-high sensitivity ELISA, developed using human monoclonal antibodies, which will allow pharmacokinetic study of low doses of BoNT bound to antibody:fusion peptide complexes in real-world in vivo exposure scenarios.

There is relatively little known about the role ofthe accessory toxins of V. cholerae, and whether these toxins interact with the innate immune system to establish colonization. An adult mouse model of intestinal colonization by V. cholerae has recently been developed, and will be utilized in the proposed study. The MARTX toxin of V. cholerae, known to have actin cross-linking and Rho inactivation domains, is hypothesized to target neutrophils recruited to the site of infection to evade phagocytosis. Specific Aim 1. Demonstrate that the accessory toxins of Vibrio cholerae target neutrophils to establish intestinal colonization in an adult mouse model. Neutrophil replete and neutropenic mice will be inoculated with wild-type V. cholerae and a multi-toxin deficient strain to demonstrate whether the action of neutrophils is important to clearing early infection with V. cholerae, and whether accessory toxins target neutrophils to establish intestinal colonization. Specific Aim 2. Determine which catalytic function of MARTX -- Rho Inactivation or actin cross-linking - is essential for the ability of V. cholerae to promote persistent colonization. The Rho inactivation and actin cross-linking domains of MARTX will be individually mutated on the V. cholerae chromosome to inactive each domain. V. cholerae strains with these mutations will be administered to neutrophil replete and neutropenic mice to determine which domain is essential to the in vivo effects of MARTX. Specific Aim 3.

5R01AI085072-03,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Listeria monocytogenes is a food-borne, intracellular pathogen that causes gastroenteritis, abortions, or meningitis with a high mortality rate. Critical for Listeria virulence is its ability to replicate within mammalian cells and spread from one cell to another through an actin-dependent motility process that allows bacteria to remain within the protective environment of the host cytosol. Cell-cell spread of Listeria occurs in a variety of host cell types, including intestinal epithelial cells (enterocytes). Enterocytes are the first cell type infected by Listeria, and consequently play a key role in the onset of infection. Cell-cell spread is initiated by the bacterial surface protein ActA, which stimulates the formation of F-actin 'comet tails' that propel Listeria through the cytoplasm. Rocketing bacteria then contact the host cell plasma membrane and induce the formation of Listeria-containing protrusions that are engulfed by neighboring cells. ActA-mediated actin polymerization is well understood. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism of protrusion formation in enterocytes or other polarized epithelia. Specifically, it remains unclear whether bacterial proteins exist that function after ActA to directly control protrusion formation.  Importantly, our preliminary data indicate that the secreted Listeria virulence protein InlC is needed for efficient protrusion formation and cell-cell spread in a polarized enterocyte cell line. InlC promotes bacterial protrusion generation by antagonizing the human adaptor protein Tuba. The precise mechanism by which InlC and Tuba control Listeria spreading remains unclear. As Tuba is a scaffolding protein, it likely affects spreading by interacting with one or more human ligands. The long-term goal of our work is to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which InlC promotes spreading of Listeria in polarized epithelial cells. The overall objective of this application is to identify human ligands of Tuba that control protrusion formation by Listeria. In addition, we aim to understand how these Tuba ligands are regulated by InlC. Our central hypothesis is that InlC controls protrusion formation by affecting Tuba and the activity and/or localization of one or more of Tuba's human ligands. The Specific Aims in this application, outlined below, are directed towards understanding how InlC, Tuba, and the ligands N-WASP, Cdc42, and ERM proteins control cell-cell spread.  AIM 1. Determine the role of the Tuba ligands N-WASP and Cdc42 in Listeria protrusion formation, and elucidate how these host proteins are controlled by InlC. AIM 2. Determine if ERM proteins act together with Tuba to control bacterial spreading.  AIM 3. Assess the role of InlC/Tuba interaction in virulence. The above objectives will be addressed through a variety of approaches, including immunofluorescence microscopy, evaluation of ERM protein phosphorylation through Western blotting, RNA interference to investigate the function of Tuba and its ligands in spreading, and virulence studies using mice.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Listeria monocytogenes is a food-borne, intracellular bacterium that causes serious illnesses (listeriosis) leading to meningitis or abortion.

Because of their ability to induce incapacitation at exceedingly low concentrations and to elicit  shock, their ease of production and their exceptional stability, SAgs are classified as Category B biological  weapons. Attempts to reverse the deleterious effects of SAg intoxication by blocking downstream effectors  such as TNF-a have failed owing to the massive levels induced. We prepared peptide mimetics of the  contact domains in the SAg and a novel SAg receptor essential for the induction of Th1 cytokines which  prevent lethal shock in a D-galactosamine (D-GalN)-sensitized mouse model of SEB as well as  incapacitation in pigs.

In Specific  Aim I we will determine whether antagonist peptides protect and rescue mice from LPS/SAg lethal synergy.  Exposure to SAg and gut-derived LPS likely mimics the clinical situation, and the mechanism of SAg-induced  pathology differs from that which occurs with D-GaIN sensitization. In Specific Aim II, we will define the  mechanism of antagonist peptide-mediated protection, show that it is broad-spectrum against SAgs, and  assess whether peptide antagonists impair responses to immune stimulation with antigens or host defenses  against live infection.

Arsenic has been linked to increased risk of infectious disease and, possibly, other manifestations of immune dysfunction but there is uncertainty about the mechanism and full scope of its potential immunotoxicities. Emerging evidence suggests that As may perturb T cell function, including both effector T cells and T regulatory cells (Treg), a subset of T cells identified by our laboratoy and others to play a critical role in suppressing inflammation. Moreover, many immunotoxicants have profound effects when exposure occurs during prenatal development of the immune system. Yet, there are few, if any, studies of the relation of prenatal As exposure with specific measures of immune function. We propose to assess the relation of in utero As exposure (measured via maternal pregnancy urine As) with immune function at birth and age 1 year. The study will build on prospectively collected exposure, biospecimen, and extensive covariate and health data available from an ongoing cohort study of pregnant women and their infants in New Hampshire. Our hypothesis is that there will be a link between in utero As exposure and immune dysfunction, including impaired T cell and Treg function (in cord blood and placenta), which can lead to decreased responses to vaccinations, and possibly, increased infant susceptibility to infection and atopy. To test these hypotheses we will determine whether in utero As exposure is associated with: 1) impaired T cell and Treg function in infant cord blood samples, and 2) decreased immune indicators of placental tolerance. Also, we will 3) conduct exploratory analyses of T cell and Treg function in umbilical cord blood as predictors of enhanced risk of infant infections and atopic disorders as assessed during the 1st year of life, and 4) test the feasibility of determining T cell function, vaccine response and IgE levels in 1 year olds and their relation to As.

Imidazoles, particularly metronidazole, are the single class of drugs used worldwide for treatment. Resistance to metronidazole is a growing concern in multiple protozoa, including Giardia, Trichomonas vaginalis, and E. histolytica. Therefore, the identification of new drugs is a priority. This proposed clinical trial is based on important findings from a U01 grant to identify new drug targets in Class B protozoa. By screening all FDA approved drugs against E. histolytica trophozoites, we found one drug, auranofin, an oral gold-containing compound approved in 1985 to treat rheumatoid arthritis, had an IC50 of 0.5 &#191;M, 10-fold lower than metronidazole (5.2 &#191;M).

It is becoming increasingly appreciated that low and non-cytotoxic concentrations of arsenic can amplify the DNA damaging and carcinogenic potential of other genotoxic agents such as ultraviolet radiation, at least in part, through inhibition of DNA repair processes. The mechanisms by which arsenic inhibits DNA repair target proteins is central to understanding the carcinogenic and co-carcinogenic potential of arsenic and to identify avenues to reverse or prevent the adverse effects of arsenic exposure in human populations. The current project will test the hypothesis that arsenic-generated reactive oxygen and nitrogen species inhibits the activity of zinc finger DNA repair proteins through reaction with redox-sensitive cysteine residues of the zinc finger domains. In Aim 1 we will investigate the impact of arsenic-mediated iNOS and NADPH oxidase (NOX) induction and subsequent nitric oxide and superoxide generation on the activity of two DNA repair proteins (XPA and PARP-1), DNA repair and genotoxicity in keratinocytes. Genetic and pharmacologic disruption of iNOS and NOX will define which pathway(s) are involved in arsenic-mediated inhibition of DNA repair. Aim 2 will investigate the interaction of arsenic-generated reactive oxygen and nitrogen species with the zinc fingers of XPA and PARP-1 and apply analytical techniques to define specific modifications of the zinc finger domain and consequences with regard to zinc binding. Data generated by our laboratories and others indicate selectivity for arsenic binding to zinc finger structures and we find that arsenic- bound, but not zinc bound, zinc finger peptide is highly vulnerable to oxidation We will test whether arsenic binding to a zinc finger translates to targeted oxidative and nitrosative modification and loss of zinc finger protein function. In Aim 3, we will test the iNOS and NOX dependence for the reported synergism between arsenic and ultraviolet radiation in DNA damage and skin tumorigenesis in vivo using genetic models. Thus, this project rigorously tests mechanisms of arsenic inhibition of key DNA repair target proteins using a multi- faceted approach. The outcomes from these studies will improve our understanding of mechanisms underlying arsenic disruption of zinc finger DNA repair protein function and may have significant impact on treatments or preventative interventions for arsenic exposed populations. Additionally, these studies may lead to testable hypotheses regarding potential arsenic targets in cancer and other arsenic-associated diseases.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Arsenic in drinking water exceeds the current EPA maximum contaminant level (MCL) in several areas of the United States, notably the north central region and western states. Given the widespread public exposure to arsenic in municipal and private water supplies, there is interest and concern in observations that arsenic concentrations at or near the MCL greatly enhance the carcinogenic potential of other DNA damaging agents.

5R01HD060338-05,National Institute of Child Health and Human Development,23,"Up to 40% of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV occurs during breastfeeding BF, and two-thirds of BF-associated MTCT occurs among infants after 6 mo of age. Early BF cessation is recommended by WHO as one way to minimize MTCT, but several studies in developing countries have observed high rates of associated gastroenteritis, growth faltering, and mortality. This is not surprising since the 6 to 24 month period of life is a time when growth faltering is prevalent even among BF children of HIV-negative mothers. During this period, mean weight-for-age-Z scores (WAZ) and length-for-age-Z-scores (LAZ) of children living in Africa and Asia plummet to -1.5 to -2.5, followed by little or no recovery thereafter. The resulting underweight and stunting malnutrition underlies 50% and 35%, respectively, of all under-5 mortality, and results in long-term deficits in cognitive development, reduced school performance, and lower adult economic productivity. The 6 to 24 mo period is characterized by the gradual addition or other foods and liquids and with high rates of diarrheal disease. Efforts to enhance growth by improving complementary feeding practices among 6 to 24 mo old children have generally met with modest success: most improve WAZ and LAZ by 0.1 - 0.5 Z scores at 18 - 24 mo. Another literature indicates that provision of water and especially sanitation services, reduces diarrhea and enhances child growth, producing increases in WAZ and LAZ by the same order of magnitude as complementary feeding interventions. Furthermore, the effects on growth are greater than and independent of the effects on diarrhea, suggesting these services reduce subclinical enteric disease, which suppresses growth and is much more prevalent than diarrhea. This study will test the effectiveness of an intervention delivered to 500 HIV-positive mothers and their children from mid-gestation to 24 mos. The intervention will include sanitation services (provision of a latrine), improved hygiene (promotion of hand washing), and improved nutrition (promotion of exclusive BF from birth to 6 mo for all infants; promotion of expressed and heat-treated breast milk (no direct BF) for HIV-exposed infants testing PCR-negative at 6 months and continued BF for exposed infants testing PCR-positive at 6 months; improved feeding practices; and provision of Nutributter, a micronutrient fortified food). All interventions will be delivered by an existing (albeit strengthened) village health worker network in the community. Primary infant outcomes will be: infection-free survival at 24 months among 6-mo PCR- negative infants; hemoglobin at 12 and 18 months; and linear and ponderal growth.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Each year, 200,000 infants are infected with HIV during breastfeeding, so the World Health Organization recommends that HIV-positive mothers stop breastfeeding to reduce this transmission. Unfortunately, not breastfeeding in resource-constrained settings is associated with high rates of diarrhea, poor growth, and death. This study will test provision of a nutrition, sanitation, and hygiene intervention as an approach to minimize HIV-exposure while also promoting growth and health in young children born to HIV-positive mothers in developing countries.",Effect Of A Sanitation & Nutrition Intervention On HIV-Exposed Infant Health,2008,2014,"Humphrey, Jean Hawes",Johns Hopkins University,Baltimore,MD,25,1,97,3850
5R01AI052167-11,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Yersinia enterocolitica is a Gram-negative pathogen responsible for a range of clinical syndromes but is primarily associated with gastrointestinal disorders. A number of important paradigms of pathogenesis have emerged from the studies of Y. enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis. In addition these enteropathogens have served as important models of bacterial invasion, a process primarily encoded by inv. Virulence properties such as invasion can be characterized at the molecular level due to the ease of manipulation of these bacteria in the laboratory and the existence of an excellent murine model of infection for dissecting the host-pathogen interaction. In studies to further our knowledge of inv and its role in virulence we identified a gene, rovA, that regulates expression of inv both in the laboratory and during infection. Subsequent studies demonstrated that RovA acts as a DNA binding protein and promotes inv expression by displacing a repressor complex from the inv promoter. The rovA mutant was less virulent than either the wild type strain or the inv mutant. The rovA virulence defect is characterized by reduced systemic dissemination and an increased LD50 after oral infection. Infection using the i.p. route abrogates the rovA defect, suggesting RovA is required for events occurring either in/from the intestine/colon or in the Peyer's patch. Because the rovA mutant virulence defect was more significant than that of an inv mutant alone, this suggested RovA regulates additional virulence determinants. However, RovA did not appear to regulate the expression of previously identified virulence determinants. Using whole genome microarray analysis we identified 64 genes potentially regulated by RovA, suggesting the regulon may be quite large. The long-term goals are (i) to understand how these genes are regulated by RovA and how that is coordinated with expression of other virulence factors, and (ii) to determine which RovA regulated genes (rrg) contribute to virulence. Specifically we propose the following: (Aim 1) What is the role of the RovA regulon during infection? Recently our understanding of how enteric pathogens interact with the intestinal mucosa and spread systemically has changed significantly but questions still remain. In addition, questions regarding how these bacteria spread from host-to-host are more tractable. Given the known virulence defects of the rovA mutant, we hypothesize that the RovA regulon will play a role in these host-pathogen interactions and feel that a more detailed understanding of both wild type and the rovA mutant with respect to these aspects of infection is warranted. (Aim 2) Which rrgs are important for virulence and how do they contribute to individual RovA-associated phenotypes? (Aim 3) Are all rrgs regulated in the same way as inv? By knowing when and where these gene products are expressed combined with information regarding the phenotype of mutations in these genes we may be able to gain a better understanding of their function.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Gastrointestinal disease is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in infants and of morbidity in adults. Our long-range goal is to gain a full understanding of the Yersinia enterocolitica virulence factors and their contribution to the disease process at the molecular level. This will expand our understanding and ability to intervene therapeutically not only with Yersinia but with many other gastrointestinal pathogens as well.",ROVA REGULON AND VIRULENCE OF YERSINIA ENTEROCOLITICA,2002,2013,"Miller, Virginia L",Univ of North Carolina Chapel Hill,Chapel Hill,NC,38,1,-1,2
5R01AI083252-03,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Bacterial toxins are the causative agents for a variety of human diseases. However, the molecular basis of infection, in many cases, remains enigmatic. Cholera toxin (CT) produced by Vibrio cholerae is the virulence factor responsible for massive secretory diarrhea. As this disease remains a global health issue, elucidating its basic mechanism of action is paramount. To intoxicate cells, CT is transported from the cell surface to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In this compartment, the toxic CTA1 fragment of CT disguises as a misfolded protein and hijacks the cellular machinery that normally moves misfolded proteins from the ER into the cytosol for degradation by the proteasome. Upon reaching the cytosol, CTA1 however escapes proteasomal destruction and triggers a signaling cascade that leads to pathologic water secretion (i.e. diarrhea), which can lead to death in severe cases. How CTA1 is transferred from the ER into the cytosol, a decisive intoxication step, remains poorly understood. In this application, we intend to address this question by using a combination of biochemical and cell biological approaches. Historically, studies on pathogen-host cell interactions have expounded on basic cellular processes. Moreover, these findings often led to the identification of key molecular targets amenable for therapeutic intervention. Thus we anticipate that our findings are likely to reveal novel mechanisms of protein transport across biological membranes and to identify new cellular factors that may serve as viable therapeutic targets. In addition, as other toxins such as ricin and shiga toxin also undergo ER-to-cytosol transport to induce cytotoxicity, our results should provide insights into their mechanism of action as well.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cholera toxin (CT) causes pathologic water secretion (i.e. diarrhea) in animals, which can lead to death in severe cases. A decisive step in the toxin-dependent infection process is transport of the toxin across the membrane of a sub-cellular compartment known as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). However, the molecular details by which CT penetrate the ER membrane is not clear.

5R01AI079154-04,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"The expression of Attaching and Effacing Escherichia coli (AEEC) virulence factors is a tightly regulated process, and, in some cases, the identification of these factors has been difficult because they are either repressed in vitro or the conditions of expression are unknown. While it is evident that expression of certain virulence factors is strictly associated with human disease, the additional factors present in AEEC strains that are linked to their pathogenic process remain unclear. Lack of a full understanding of how the genes encoding these additional virulence factors are controlled is important, because, without this knowledge, we are unlikely to understand the overall pathogenic properties of AEEC strains. Thus, our objective is to determine how the Long Polar (LP) fimbriae in AEEC strains contribute to pathogenesis and to use these fimbrial-encoding genes as markers to detect virulent strains. The central hypothesis is that, in addition to the already characterized colonization factors (e.g., intimin-mediated adhesion), AEEC strains possess a highly regulated LP fimbriae, that plays a role in the colonization process, and although the genes encoding these fimbriae are widely distributed in pathogenic E. coli strains, some LP fimbriae types are found exclusively in specific AEEC strains. We will test this hypothesis through three specific aims, which are to: 1) Define whether Ler and H-NS act as a selective silencing/anti-silencing defense system that controls LP fimbriae expression in AEEC strains; 2) Identify the regulatory protein(s) controlling LP fimbriae expression in atypical EPEC and determine in a rabbit model the function of LP fimbriae during colonization; and 3) Characterize the distribution of the LP fimbrial gene clusters among AEEC strains and determine whether certain LP fimbrial subunit types are reliable markers of different pathogenic AEEC strains. To accomplish our aims, we will fully characterize the functions of Ler, H-NS, and atypical enteropathogenic E. coli-encoded regulators under in vitro and in vivo (infant rabbit colonization model) conditions and perform a detailed study of prevalence of the lpf genes in specific subsets of pathogenic AEEC strains. Our research work is innovative because it capitalizes on our findings regarding novel colonization factors in AEEC strains and their potential application in therapeutics and diagnostics. The results from studies of the regulatory networks controlling LP fimbriae expression have significance, because we will be able to identify fundamental differences to explain the tissue tropism of different AEEC strains and to determine whether silencing of LP fimbriae is an example of a defense system that AEEC strains have against horizontally acquired genes. In addition, the use of the rabbit model will give us new insight into the pathogenesis and colonization properties of AEEC strains. An understanding of the mechanisms underlying AEEC colonization to the gastrointestinal tract will not only further our knowledge of the pathogenesis of these organisms but also provide opportunities for reducing infection rates and improving treatment options against these biological agents classified as category B pathogens due to their potential use as a food safety threat.",Long Polar Fimbriae Of Attaching And Effacing Escherichia Coli,2009,2014,"Torres, Alfredo G",University of Texas Medical Br Galveston,Galveston,TX,51,1,-1,3933
5K23AI083883-04,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Food allergy affects as many as 6% of young children and 3-4% of adults.(1,2) Peanut allergy is the leading cause of food-induced anaphylaxis treated in hospital emergency departments in the United States (3) and peanut and tree nut allergies account for approximately 80% of fatal and near-fatal anaphylactic reactions.(4-6) While the majority of children outgrow their allergy to milk, egg, wheat, and soy, allergies to peanut, tree nuts, fish and shellfish are often life-long. Currently, there are no treatments that can cure or provide long-term remission from food allergy.  Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has been used to treat various diseases for thousands of years. Chinese herbal medicine, particularly in the form of formulas that are composed of several herbs, is one of the major components in the practice of TCM. The Food Allergy Herbal Formula (FAHF-2) is a 9 herb formula (7-14) that has been demonstrated to be safe and effective in a murine model of peanut allergy.(15,16) Furthermore, FAHF-2 appears to be safe and well-tolerated in food-allergic patients. This protection from anaphylaxis in the murine model is associated with decreased IgE, increased lgG2a, decreased peripheral basophils, and decreased cell surface expression of FceRI on mast cells and basophils. Thus, we hypothesize that FAHF-2 is a safe and effective herbal therapy for food allergy and this protection is associated with suppression of food specific IgE while increasing food-specific IgG (and lgG4), decreased IgE epitope diversity, and suppression of basophil numbers and function. These aims will be investigated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, using standard protocols, including double-blind, placebo-controlled oral food challenges, to evaluate clinical outcomes including long- term efficacy. RELEVANCE (See instructions): The goal of this study will be to validate the clinical efficacy of Chinese herbal medicine in food allergies and to elucidate the mechanisms of action of this herbal formula.

This application is for a K01 Mentored Career Development Award combines formal education, structured mentorship and training with a detailed research plan that will allow Dr. Kile to become an independent investigator who specializes in perinatal environmental epidemiology capable of investigating epigenetic-environmental interactions associated with prenatal exposure to environmental chemicals.        Epidemiological and experimental studies suggest that the intrauterine environment may represent a biologically sensitive window for chemicals that may impair growth and organ development that result in adverse health outcomes later in life. While the mechanisms behind these relationships are unclear, it has been hypothesized that epigenetic dysregulation is involved. Prospective longitudinal birth cohorts in exposed populations are the optimal design to study the effects of in utero chemical exposures and epigenetic- environmental interactions that could lead to life-long phenotypic changes. For this award, Dr. Kile will use data collected from 3 prospective longitudinal birth cohorts that were specifically designed to evaluate the effects of prenatal metal exposure on perinatal and pediatric health outcomes to 1) examine the association between prenatal arsenic exposure, a common environmental pollutant, and fetal growth; 2) investigate the interaction between arsenic and DNA methylation of endothelial nitric oxide gene (eNOS) and the insulin-like growth factor gene (Igf2) which are well characterized and involved in fetal growth and development using umbilical cord leukocytes and umbilical vein endothelials cells; and 3) explore the association between Igf2 gene DNA methylation and fetal growth.        Dr. Kile is well positioned to carry out the proposed studies because of her prior research experience in molecular environmental epidemiology and the unique resources available through her mentorship team including access to 3 large established prospective longitudinal birth cohorts that will provide the necessary exposure assessment data, genetic material, newborn measurements and covariate data during this award period; access to state-of-the-art molecular biological laboratories; and, advanced coursework in perinatal epidemiology and epigenetics.

Although HAART therapy has improved survival, the deficits continue to be presented in these patients. Moreover, many amongst the AIDS population do not take HAART and toxoplasmic encephalitis is manifestation of their HIV infection. Understanding of host immune mechanisms responsible for protection against this parasite in immunocompetent individuals is essential for the development of immunotherapeutic agents for immunocompromised hosts like those suffering from AIDS. In addition to their protective role during acute infection, innate immune factors like DC and NK cells are important for optimal induction of CD8+ T cell immunity against infection. Role of CD8+ T cell immunity in long-term protection against T.gondii infection is well documented. Preliminary studies from my laboratory have demonstrated that oral Toxoplasma challenge results in strong dendritic cell (DC) response in the gut, which may be a key for launching a primary CD8+ T cell response against the parasite, in this tissue. Understanding the development of CD8+ T cell immunity during natural (per-oral) route of infection is the main focus of this proposal. The proposal comprises of three specific aims. In the first specific aim the induction of different subsets of DC in response to oral T.gondii infection and their cytokine (IL-12, IL-15 and IFN) production will be assayed. The role of DC as major IL-15 producers ( a cytokine essential for maintenance memory CD8+ T cells) during T.gondii infection will be evaluated. Finally the experiments will be performed to determine the DC subset involved in the priming of CD8+ T cell response against parasite. Recent studies from our laboratory have shown that NK-DC interaction via NKG2D molecule is essential for priming of robust CD8+ T cell immunity against T.gondii. In the second specific aim DC population responsible for the NK-DC interaction will be identified and signaling events following this NKG2D mediated event analyzed. The role of NKG2D on the CD8+ T cell immunity during secondary or long-term infection will be assayed. In the third specific aim importance of IL-7 and IL-15 in the generation and maintenance of CD8+ T cell effector memory (TEM) and central memory (TCM) will be studied. The mechanism by which CD4+ T cells control the long-term maintenance of CD8+ T cell response against the parasite will be analyzed. Finally the strategies, which can lead to the development and long-term survival of immune, CD8+ T cells in an immunocompromised situation will be evaluated.

1R15AI094437-01A1,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Human infection with influenza virus poses a significant annual global health threat, especially when they are complicated by secondary bacterial infections. During the recent H1N1 pandemic, S. pyogenes has caused about 1/3 of the deaths associated with bacterial secondary infections; however, relatively little is known about influenza-S. pyogenes superinfections. Influenza infection induces thrombosis, which results in fibrinogen/fibrin (Fb) and fibronectin (Fn) deposition in the respiratory tract. These ae well-known ligands involved in S. pyogenes adherence and aggregation and its ability to resist killing by macrophages. We hypothesize that influenza-induced thrombosis promotes superinfections due, in part, to the binding of Fb and Fn to the surface of the pathogen, which increases bacterial adherence and biofilm formation, and by diminishes immune clearance. To test this hypothesis, we will complete the following specific aims: 1) Delete each of the two Fb/Fn binding proteins (PrtF.2 and M3) of S. pyogenes strain MGAS315 and determine the contribution of each to Fb and Fn binding. 2) Determine if PrtF.2 and M3 proteins influence adherence to epithelial cells infected with influenza, and biofilm formation, in a Fb/Fn-dependent manner. 3) Determine if PrtF.2 and M3-mediated binding of Fb/Fn alters the efficiency of macrophage killing of S. pyogenes either with, or without, antecedent influenza exposure. 4) Determine if PrtF.2 and M3 protein contribute to the excess morbidity and mortality in an established murine model. The project addresses an important public health concern and may lead to new ways to mitigate the excess morality associated with influenza.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Influenza causes an average of 250-500,000 hospitalizations and 36,000 deaths on an annual basis in the U.S. Death is typically due to the development of secondary bacterial complications, which is called excess mortality, or superinfection. During the recent flu pandemic, Streptococcus pyogenes caused about 1/3 of the known cases of superinfection. The factors that make people susceptible to superinfection are poorly understood; however, influenza infection was recently discovered to cause thrombosis resulting the deposition of fibrinogen (Fb) and fibronection (Fn) in the respiratory tract. Fb and Fn binding  to the surface of S. pyogenes via specific receptors enhances pathogen adherence to human tissue and confers resistance to the innate immune system. The project will determine the role of Fb/Fn binding to bacteria as a cause of superinfections.

5R01DK067286-08,National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,24,"The intestinal epithelial monolayer pays a crucial role not only in regulating transcellular and paracellular nutrient absorption, but also by providing an innate barrier against pathogenic and commensal bacteria and microbial and dietary antigens. Breakdown of this protective barrier has been implicated in the pathogenesis of acute illnesses such as bacterial translocation leading to sepsis and multiple organ system failure. It also has been implicated in several chronic diseases having their origins during infancy that manifest in later life. These include atopic disease such eczema, food allergies, celiac enteropathy, type 1 diabetes, asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease. Important inducers of intestinal barrier dysfunctions include proinflammatory cytokines (with IFN-? as a prototypical barrier-damaging cytokine) and infiltrating and translocating neutrophils and their enzymatic products. Chronic and severe neutrophil infiltration, transepithelial migration and enzymatic and oxidative damages of the epithelium and the extracellular matrix, significantly contribute to the impairment of the epithelial barrier. In a number of inflammatory human diseases, including ischemic bowel injury, necrotizing enterocolitis, and idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease, intense neutrophil transepithelial migration is a prevalent feature and correlates with disease pathophysiology. In this proposal, we hypothesize that curcumin improves intestinal barrier through inhibition of IFN-? signaling in the CEC, inhibition of neutrophil recruitment and apical retention, and thorough inhibition of the detrimental effects of neutrophils on the barrier function during transmigration. These effects likely underlie the demonstrated protective effects of curcumin in intestinal inflammation, as demonstrated in animal models of colitis and in the clinical trial with ulcerative colitis patients. We propose to address these newly attributed functions of curcumin in three specific aims tailored to (1) identify the molecular mechanism of the inhibitory effects of curcumin on IFN-? signaling in the colonocytes; (2) identify the molecular mechanisms of inhibitory effects of curcumin on neutrophil chemokinesis and chemotaxis; and (3) to characterize the molecular mechanisms of the protective effects of curcumin on neutrophil-induced epithelial dysfunction. In summary, the proposed project will provide novel information about the mechanisms and molecular targets of curcumin in improving the intestinal barrier function.

Specifically, we aim to detect Entamoeba, Giardia, Cryptosporidium and Cyclospora, parasites, which pose a public health risk via drinking water supply contamination. Diagnosis of all four of these parasites is currently performed by microscopy of stained stool samples, some of which can be confirmed by antigen-detection tests. We propose to implement a chip-scale high-resolution optofluidic microscopy (OFM) system that is capable of color and fluorescence imaging to detect and analyze these parasites in a streamlined and cost- effective manner. Automated microscopic detection of cysts using antigen specific OFM fluorescence detection will not only allow a multiplex, single-step approach for four different pathogens, but will also provide an automated diagnosis, eliminating the need for clinically-trained personnel. It will also scale up the throughput rate and reduce the time and labor required for diagnosis. We will also integrate magnetic sample concentration technology to eliminate the need for centrifuge-based concentration in field analysis. On the reagent front, we propose to develop monoclonal antibodies for direct immunofluorescence that will be generated against whole cysts or recombinant forms of defined cyst-specific antigens. The proposed project will benefit biodefense in two major ways. First, the proposed OFM system and associated antibody implementation will directly benefit current clinical practices by replacing the slide prep and microscopy imaging step with a simple, drop-and-go, low cost and automatable imaging cytometry analysis. Second, the addition of magnetic sample concentration will eliminate the need for a centrifuge and create a technology set that is broadly usable and well suited to address emergency scenarios.

5U01AI082051-04,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) represent one of the most serious bioterror threats to our national security. Secreted by spore forming bacteria Clostridium botulinum, baratii, and butyricium, BoNTs are responsible for the flaccid paralysis associated with botulism. Listed as category A biothreats by the CDC, BoNTs are the most toxic of biological toxins, are easily produced, and may be delivered by various routes including food spiking (solid and liquid) and aerosol dispersion. There are no therapeutics to counter BoNT induced paralysis once the enzyme has entered the neuronal cytosol - at this time the only treatment option is impractical mechanical ventilation in a critical care setting. The long-term objective of this project is to address this public health threat by developing potent small molecule, non-peptidic, inhibitors (SMNPIs) of BoNTs as therapeutics that will serve as both rescue agents and prophylactics. Specific aims 1 - 3 of the proposal focus on translating our lead uM range SMNPIs of BoNT serotype A into low nM range SMNPIs that are effective in an animal model. Specific aim 4 concentrates on identifying and developing SMNPIs of BoNT serotype B that are effective in a neuronal assay, and specific aim 5 covers the identification of SMNPIs of BoNT serotype E. Finally, under specific aim 6, we propose examining all identified and developed SMNPIs for broad spectrum inhibitory activity against more than one BoNT serotype. To achieve the project goals we combine three-dimensional pharmacophore-based methods and synthetic organic chemistry strategies. Specifically, such methods combine X-ray crystallography, in vitro and in vivo biological testing, molecular modeling and 3-D database mining, and organic chemistry to guide SMNPI discovery and optimization (i.e., good in vitro potencies, good ADMET profiles, reduced toxicities, and enhanced in vivo efficacies in an animal model).

1R01AI095255-01A1,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Many pathogens use the intestinal mucosa as the primary site of entry. The intestinal mucosa must induce a rapid and strong immune response to defend against such pathogenic invasion, yet an excessive immune response to commensal flora leads to chronic inflammation like inflammatory bowel disease. While it is evident that mucosal antigen-presenting cells (APCs) play a key role in orchestrating the effector response to pathogens, it is unclear how APCs maintain homeostasis with commensals. At the initiation of an immune response, mucosal APCs sense pathogens by using toll- like receptors (TLRs) that in turn signal through the adapter molecules MyD88 (myeloid differentiation factor 88) or TRIF (Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adapter inducing IFN-&#191;). Most research has focused on the MyD88 pathway because it is used by almost all TLRs and it leads to a robust NF-&#191;B response. However, strong NF-&#191;B activation may also destroy host tissues. By contrast, the TRIF pathway is only induced by TLR4 or TLR3 and supports regulatory responses through induction of IFN&#191;. Therefore, there must be unique roles of TRIF pathway in intestinal immune regulations, but how this pathway contributes to host defense against intestinal bacterial infection has not been studied. Our ultimate goal is to protect the intestinal mucosa from infection and chronic inflammation through the future development of vaccines and immunotherapies. But fundamental research is needed to understand specific aspects of TLR signaling in the intestinal mucosa to achieve this goal. The objective of this application is to understand how APCs regulate intestinal immune responses through TRIF signaling. We wish to test the hypothesis that TRIF signaling in APCs regulates protective immune responses in the intestine. Using Yersinia enterocolitica as a model enteric pathogen, we found that TRIF-deficient mice had a significant defect in macrophage bactericidal activity. They succumb to infection due to systemic Y. enterocolitica dissemination. These findings lead us to examine how TRIF signaling in APCs regulates intestinal immune responses during bacterial infection. Once the mechanism of TRIF-mediated immune defense is elucidated, this signaling can be pharmacologically manipulated leading to innovative approaches in the management of inflammatory and infectious diseases affecting the intestine. Targeting TRIF is advantageous because a clinically tested TLR3 ligand is available.

7R01AI083646-04,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"We will use the power of complete genome sequences and forward genetics to identify novel genes that allow a bacterial pathogen to colonize systemic organs in murine models. Non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) are food-borne bacterial pathogens that cause hundreds of millions of cases of diarrheal disease and hundreds of thousands of deaths due to bacteremia annually worldwide. Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium is an appropriate model to determine the requirements for systemic infection by NTS as this serotype causes more cases of NTS bacteremia, in children under the age of 5 and in HIV infected individuals, than any other serotype. The availability of complete genome sequence information, the ease of genetic manipulation, and the availability of numerous animal models make serot. Typhimurium an excellent model system. We have generated a collection of 1030 targeted deletion strains in serot. Typhimurium (approximately 25% of the genome), developed a novel oligonucleotide microarray to assay this collection of mutants, and begun forward genetic screening of this mutant collection both in vitro and in vivo in murine models of systemic colonization. We wish to complete the development of these tools and progress to more comprehensive studies of a subset of genes involved in systemic colonization a process that occurs during NTS bacteremia caused by this organism. We will approach this goal by: 1. Completion of our deletion library in all non-essential genes in Salmonella Typhimurium, 2. Screening our complete deletion collection in murine models to identify new genes involved in systemic colonization, 3. Confirming each mutant as defective for systemic colonization, 4. Characterizing mutants that are defective for systemic colonization for their ability to associate with, invade, and replicate in cultured macrophages. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Salmonella is a leading cause of food borne illness, causing ~1.4 million cases of diarrheal disease per year and is the single most common cause of death from food-borne illnesses associated with viruses, parasites or bacteria in the US primarily in immunocompromised persons. In young children and HIV-infected individuals, non-typhoidal Salmonellae (NTS) frequently cause systemic infection that is associated with high mortality. The rise of AIDS in many parts of the world, notably in sub- Saharan Africa, has resulted in a dramatic increase in the frequency of NTS-associated systemic infections. The work described in this project will provide novel targets for vaccines and treatments for acute systemic disease that results from Salmonella infection.

Virulent Campylobacter species, Vibrio cholerae, enteropathogenic E.coli (EPEC), enterohemorrhagic E.coli (EHEC) and pathogenic strains of Norwalk virus, the leading bacterial and viral causes of human infectious diarrhea [3], adhere to gut epithelial surfaces through binding to 1(1,2) fucosylated cellular receptors[4][5]. 1(1,2) fucosylated glycans, which are abundant in human breast milk[6][7], have been shown both in vitro and in vivo effectively to prevent binding and infection by these pathogens[4][5]. These molecules therefore represent a new class of agent with potential to prevent infectious diarrhea, a condition that is the cause annually of over 2 million deaths worldwide [8]. However the production of 1(1,2) fucosylated glycans as anti-infective agents in sufficient quantities to impact global diarrhea incidence remains a significant challenge. Chemical syntheses are possible, but are limited by stereo-specificity issues, product impurities, and high overall cost[9][10][11]. In vitro enzymatic syntheses are also possible but are limited by a requirement for expensive nucleotide-sugar precursors. Glycosyn Inc.<s broad goal is to develop ways to manufacture 1(1,2) fucosylated glycans cheaply and in bulk through microbial fermentation, and three classes of potential anti-infective products are envisaged: 1) purified 1(1,2) fucosylated oligosaccharides, 2) yeast strains expressing 1(1,2) fucosylated glycans on their cell surface, and 3) purified 1(1,2) fucosylated glycoproteins. [[[The goal of the studies outlined in this application are to produce in the dairy yeast Kluyveromyces lactis an example of the first of these product classes, namely a purified 1(1,2) fucosylated oligosaccharide, 22-fucosyllactose (22-FL), in sufficient amounts to test this molecule<s efficacy as a single agent in in vitro and in vivo infection models. Glycan synthetic pathways in Kluyveromyces lactis will be engineered through a combination of endogenous gene manipulation and the introduction of heterologous genes encoding desired activities.

A subsequent goal is to increase the yield of 2<-fucolsyllactose recovered from K.lactis to approach levels that will be required for commercialization.

Environmental pathogens such as Escherchia coli, Salmonella, and Shigella, which are transmitted to the food chain from polluted irrigation and fertilization systems, have been shown to possess both of these plasmid-encoded elements. Patients infected with either virulent or antibiotic resistant microorganisms from contaminated food face severely limited treatment options or significantly prolonged therapeutic regimens. My long term objectives are to increase our understanding of conjugative plasmid transfer between environmental pathogens as it relates to the spread of antibiotic resistance genes and virulence factors. Conjugative plasmid transfer is the method by which these elements are spread among pathogenic and non-pathogenic microbial strains. Transfer of the prototypical F (fertility) plasmid and the numerous R (resistance) plasmids is mediated by a plasmid-specific Tral enzyme. We have identified potent (EC50 and Ki values in the nanomolar range) inhibitors of F plasmid transfer and Tral-mediated plasmid cleavage. Because F and R plasmid Tral enzymes share up to 98% sequence identity, I hypothesize that similar small molecules will be effective inhibitors of R plasmid transfer. The specific aims of this proposal are to: first, identify potent inhibitors of the F plasmid Tral enzyme; second, compare the structure of the Tral enzyme from the F plasmid to those of R plasmid Tral enzymes; third, identify inhibitors targeting the R plasmid Tral enzymes. I will use a combination of molecular biology and biochemistry to elucidate the structural basis of Tral inhibition and to identify new inhibitors of Tral enzymes encoded on the both F and R plasmids.

In recent years it has been demonstrated that this complex system of communication can include not just bacterial produced signals, but also host derived signals to control gene expression of virulence in pathogenic species. This proposal combines the expertise of five laboratories to develop compounds that compromise bacterial quorum sensing. By targeting quorum sensing we decrease the possibility of the development of resistance as it is not an essential biological process and thus negative selective pressure will be minor. We have identified a promising compound that inhibits the virulence of enterohemorrhagic E. coli and Salmonella species causing numerous food poisoning syndromes, as well as Francisella tularensis, the causative agent of tularemia by interfering with quorum sensing. These three diverse organisms, and potentially many others, can all be targeted by a single compound due to the presence of a widely conserved membrane bound receptor protein. Preliminary data suggests that this compound is specific for bacterial systems at concentrations in the picomolar range and has no obvious adverse effects on the host. In addition to the single compound that we have significant preliminary data for a number of alternative distinct compounds have also been identified and may be further developed.

We will determine the genome sequence of 20 EPEC strains recently isolated from children who succumbed to diarrhea, 20 strains from children with non-lethal sypmptomatic infection and 20 strains from asymptomatic control children. We will specifically seek new genetic loci that are associated with symptomatic infection and with lethal outcome. We will determine the host cell targets and mechanisms of action of two proteins, NIeB and NIeE, that are secreted by EPEC and injected into host cells and that have been associated in previous studies with increased virulence in humans. We will also determine the contributions to pathgenesis of novel EPEC genetic loci associated with virulence identified by the above genomic sequencing. And we will determine the target and mechanism of action of a protein known as ShET2 that is produced and secreted by both EPEC and Shigella, associated with increased virulence in human EPEC infection, and has been proposed but not proven to be injected into host cells.

5R01AI059176-09,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Toxoplasma gondii is an extremely common parasite of animals and humans and an important opportunistic pathogen in immunocompromised patients. Our previous studies indicate that strains of T. gondii from North America and Europe comprise just three highly clonal lineages. More recent studies indicate a very different population structure in South America, consisting of distinct lineages with greater genetic diversity. Increasingly, toxoplasmosis has been recognized as a cause of ocular infection in otherwise healthy individuals from South America, where most common parasite lineages are highly virulent in animal models. However, knowledge about the population structure of T. gondii from much of the world remains unavailable. Our studies indicate that lineages from North America an Europe are related by a recent common ancestry and the inheritance of a monomorphic version of chromosome 1a (Chr1a*). Surprisingly, Chr1a* also recently been spreading into the South, where it may be associated with expansion of a few successful lineages. We will explore the hypothesis that Chr1a* carries particular genes that impart increased fitness, hence leading to clonal expansion of lineages inheriting this chromosome. The spread of clonalilty in T. gondii may also have influenced transmission and pathogenicity, and hence understanding the population structure is of direct importance to human disease. The proposed studies will enlist an international consortium of investigators to define the population structure of T. gondii. We will examine the genetic diversity of T. gondii, map the spread of Chr1a*, and test models for the origin and expansion of clonal lineages. Expected outcomes include: 1) characterize the genetic composition of T. gondii strains using traditional and microarray-based sequencing technologies 2) define the major haplotypes that comprise the global population structure, 3) characterize prototypic isolates for each haplotype, and 4) test isolates in animal models for the traits of transmission and virulence. Classical and molecular genetic methods will also be employed to identify genes that have driven the recent and highly successful expansion of T. gondii isolates in animals and humans around the world.

5R21AI093913-02,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"We have discovered that an Escherichia coli protein named NleB, which is highly conserved and expressed by the attaching/effacing (A/E) bacterial pathogens of significance to human health, is a potent inhibitor of host interferon (IFN) production. IFN was originally discovered as a factor secreted by virally infected cells able to mediate protection of other cells from subsequent viral infection. It has become convincingly clear that type I IFNs are important not only to anti-viral defense but also to host defense against bacterial infection.     Diarrheal disease caused by enteric bacteria is a major endemic health threat and an increasingly frequent source of foodborne illness. Among these enteric pathogens, enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) are frequent causes of infantile diarhea and hemorhagic colitis, respectively. EHEC is especially significant because it is a leading cause of pediatric renal failure.     While it is known that bacterial and viral pathogens have evolved strategies to interfere with mammalian type I IFN signaling, the extent to which bacterial effector proteins translocated by type III secretion systems (T3SS), an important virulence strategy of Gram-negative pathogens, are able to inhibit type I IFN production, has not been observed previously. These studies will elucidate, for the first time, the mechanism by which a T3SS effector inhibits IFN-? production in infected cells.     The specific aims are to: 1) Characterize the host protein(s) to which NleB binds that results in decreased IFN-? production in cells infected by attaching/effacing pathogens. 2) Determine the impact of NleB and infection by attaching/effacing pathogens on the differential activation vs. degradation-associated ubiquitination of TBK1, a host protein kinase essential to activation of type I IFN responses.     The proposed experiments will have a significant positive impact on human health because they will allow us to elucidate a novel mechanism by which enteric pathogens promote their survival by suppressing the host innate immune response. First, determining the host target of and molecular mechanism by which NleB inhibits IFN-? production will provide an important advance in our understanding of T3SS effector targets and mechanisms during infection. Notably, interplay between T3SS effectors and the type I interferon pathway has not been previously reported. Second, elucidating NleB function may suggest novel therapeutic strategies to combat bacterial diarrheal diseases. Additionally, our studies may improve the understanding of and eventually improve the treatment for viral-bacterial co-infections, as NleB-mediated suppression of type I IFN has the potential to exacerbate diarrheal illness mediated by viruses with gastrointestinal tropism.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Escherichia coli causes potentially fatal diarrheal disease and is transmitted to humans via contaminated food and water.

5R21AI097018-02,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Toxoplasma gondii is an important opportunistic infection of AIDS patients. Improved strategies and approaches are urgently needed to more effectively prevent and treat recurrent infections in AIDS. Following primary infection, a chronic life-long T. gondii infection characterized by the presence of persisting cysts containing slowly or nonreplicating bradyzoite parasite forms is established in CNS/brain. Reactivated infection due to cyst rupture during immune suppression causes a difficult to treat and life-threatening Toxoplasmic encephalitis in AIDS. Currently, no vaccine is approved for use in humans to prevent infection and drug treatments for acute infection are suboptimal. Eradicating pre-existing cysts and chronic infection is an excellent approach to control/prevent infection in AIDS. However, no current treatment is effective at eradicating pre-existing cysts and chronic infection. Lack of progress in targeting cyst stages can be attributed to major gaps in our knowledge of parasite biology underlying cyst development and maintenance of chronic infection. Recent progress in understanding the complex host-parasite interaction has revealed that many rhoptry bulb (ROP) proteins appear to be central players in host cell manipulation due to their secretion into the host cell at invasion and their subsequent localization to host cell cytosol/nucleus or their intimate association with the parasitophorous vacuole. Host cell manipulation by these secreted ROP proteins is likely to be critical to the success of parasite biology necessary for acute and chronic infection in vivo. The parasitophorous vacuole appears to be critical for replication of tachyzoites as well as being central to the development of the cyst wall and tissue cyst that characterize chronic infection. We hypothesize that a family of ~ 34 secreted ROP proteins possessing homology to kinases (the ROP kinome) are outstanding candidates as potential targets to disrupt virulence, cyst development, or chronic infection. Here, we propose to delete each predicted gene member of the secreted ROP kinome in type II T. gondii, and to then ascertain any defect in acute virulence, in early cyst development, or in chronic infection. Using a directed functional genetic approach, this work will identify specific members of the secreted ROP kinome that participate in critical functions required for establishing or maintaining chronic infection in vivo. This project will identify and validate specific secreted ROP kinases as key targets for preventing acute or chronic infection. This project will also develop essential tools and methods required for the future undertaking of larger scale higher throughput knockout and functional genomic projects in type II T. gondii.

Although these beneficial effects of zinc were first attributed to  correction of a zinc deficiency in malnourished children, studies have shown beneficial zinc effects  even in children with normal serum zinc levels before study. Studies of enteric pathogens in healthy  experimental animals and cultured cell assays have also shown protective effects of zinc in non-zinc  deficient animals or conditions. In our laboratories we discovered that zinc strongly inhibits the  production of several important virulence factors human enteropathogenic E. coli strains in vitro. We  then extended those observations to rabbit EPEC strains and found similar results. Rabbits are  natural hosts for EPEC infection, so they constitute a good animal model for us to test zinc efficacy in  vivo. Now we also have in vitro data showing that zinc also inhibits virulence in Shiga-toxigenic E.  coli (STEC, also known as enterohemorrhagic E. coli, or EHEC). In human-derived EPEC, rabbit  EPEC, and STEC, zinc decreases the bacterial production of virulence factors, including adhesins,  secreted effector proteins and Shiga toxin (Stx). We propose to further examine the effect of zinc on  A/E E.coli infections both in vitro and in vivo.

Pregnancy is an intricately orchestrated process where expanded tolerance to &#191;non-self&#191; antigens expressed by the developing fetus and host defense against infection are each simultaneously maintained.  Reciprocally, catastrophic complications arise when either host defense or tolerance to the fetus is disrupted. A number of human pathogens that includes Listeria, Plasmodium, E. coli, Group B Streptococcus, Salmonella, Chlamydia and cytomegalovirus each have a defined predisposition for prenatal infection that often results in spontaneous abortion or stillbirth. Therefore, unraveling the immune defects that cause these naturally  occurring &#191;holes&#191; in host defense during pregnancy has direct implications for new therapies aimed at boosting immunity against prenatal infection. We have assembled a novel set of transgenic mouse tools that allow the natural heterogeneity between maternal and fetal antigen to be recapitulated, and the precise identification of maternal immune cells with fetal specificity each during pregnancy. Our overall hypothesis is that the physiological expansion of immune suppressive maternal regulatory T cells (Tregs) required for sustaining tolerance to the developing fetus compromises host defense against pathogens that cause prenatal infection.  This is based on our recently published initial studies establishing susceptibility to prenatal Listeria infection is dictated by expanded maternal Tregs. Therefore, with the newfound heterogeneity and functional specialization among regulatory T cells that use unique cell-intrinsic molecules to mediate context specific immune suppression, our first goals are to identify the maternal Treg intrinsic molecules that compromise host defense and dissociate these from other cell intrinsic molecules required for sustaining fetal tolerance during pregnancy. On the other hand, the immune response to infection also has built in ways to override the impacts of Treg suppression that stimulate immune activation and optimal host defense against infection. During pregnancy however, these transient reductions in maternal Treg suppression also fracture tolerance to the developing that can dictate fetal injury or resorption. Accordingly, our secondary goals are to investigate how  prenatal infection impacts maternal Treg-mediated fetal tolerance. The first two aims will build upon a productive line of investigation illustrated in our recent publications and initial studies using prenatal Listeria infection to dissect the molecular basis for how maternal Tregs cause infection susceptibility, and to identify the Listeria-specific virulence determinants required for overriding maternal Treg suppression. To establish the  broader applicability of these findings, the final aim will investigate if overriding maternal Treg-mediated fetal tolerance also occurs for other pathogens that cause prenatal infection (e.g. Plasmodium, E. coli, Group B Streptococcus, Salmonella, Chlamydia, and cytomegalovirus). The completion of these experiments will unravel how maternal Tregs cause prenatal infection susceptibility, and establish how infection-induced shifts  in Treg-mediated fetal tolerance dictates injury to the developing fetus during prenatal infection.",The Immune Pathogenesis Of Prenatal Listeria Monocytogenes Infection,2012,2017,"Way, Sing Sing ",Cincinnati Childrens Hosp Med Ctr,Cincinnati,OH,41,1,-1,4871

The activation of caspase-1 is controlled by members of the intracellular NOD-like receptor (NLR) family including NLRC4 and NLRP3. Recent work from several laboratories indicate that NLRC4 and NLRP3 regulate caspase-1 activation through the assembly of a molecular platform termed the inflammasome that includes the adaptor ASC and caspase-1. We have obtained evidence that NLRC4 senses bacterial flagellin that is introduced into the host cytosol via membrane pores formed by bacterial type III or IV secretion systems. In contrast, NLRP3 responds to bacterial pore-forming toxins, ATP and particulate matter in macrophages stimulated with microbial molecules or endogenous cytokines.

Initially, the virus was reported to cause morbidity and mortality only in immunocompromised mice while it did not cause any clinical signs of overt diseases in immunocompetent mice. However, we found that MNV infection can induce subtle changes in immune responses even in wild type mice and that MNV infection was associated with an increase in aortic sinus lesion size in Ldlr-/- mice, a commonly used mouse model for atherosclerosis research. We observed that larger aortic sinus lesions in MNV infected mice were associated with increased numbers of macrophages. Others have reported that MNV has a tropism toward macrophages as well as dendritic cells. Our preliminary studies have also found that MNV infection alters the production of several inflammatory cytokines in bone marrow derived macrophages. Thus, we hypothesize that MNV is a potential intercurrent variable in atherosclerosis research partly by influencing macrophage recruitment, cytokine/chemokine profile, and or accumulation in atherosclerotic lesions. To test our hypothesis, we will first determine whether MNV infection exacerbates atherosclerosis in an additional mouse model, ApoE-/- mice. Next, we will investigate whether early exposure (before onset of atherosclerosis) to MNV alters disease phenotype in two commonly used mouse models, Ldlr-/- and ApoE-/-. Finally we will determine how MNV might alter the disease outcome by examining changes in macrophages, important innate immune cells involved in disease initiation and progression.

Our overall  goal is to understand the mechanism of gene regulation by defining the catalytic activity, the RNA specificity and the nutrient-dependent signaling response of CvfA. Our previous studies indicated that CvfA is associated with the glycolytic enzyme, enolase, which may be moonlighting as a nutrient-sensing regulator of CvfA activity. We also showed that in low-carbohydrate media, CvfA down-regulates the expression of the virulence factors M protein, streptokinase and CAMP factor, while up-regulating expression of the secreted protease, SpeB. Preliminary studies show that purified recombinant CvfA protein has endonuclease activity that specifically cleaves the mRNA transcript of M protein, while showing no effects on the mRNA transcript of RecA. Our working hypothesis is that CvfA is a sequence- specific endonuclease that utilizes an RNA-binding KH domain to target mRNA transcripts for cleavage by the histidine-aspartate containing (HD) phosphohydrolase domain resulting in regulation of gene expression through RNA degradation. Our specific aims are to: 1) determine the structure and RNA binding specificity of the KH domain, 2) identify the mRNA substrates of CvfA and define the nutrient dependent regulatory role of CvfA, and 3) determine the metal-dependent catalytic activity and structure of the HD domain. Our approach combines structural studies and functional assays including NMR spectroscopy to study the KH and HD domain structures, catalytic assays to define the mechanism of phosphohydrolase activity, mRNA decay assays to elucidate the nutrient signaling response, mRNA cleavage assays and in vitro selection to define the sequence specificity of CvfA. The impact of our results will lead to new therapeutic strategies against streptococcal infections following three potential approaches: 1) interference with RNA recognition by the KH domain, 2) down regulation of nutrient signaling pathways, and 3) developing inhibitors of phosphohydrolase activity based on lead compounds identified through catalytic assays.

Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is associated with a broad range of human diseases including scarlet fever, impetigo, pharyngitis, necrotizing fasciitis, streptococcal toxic shock syndrome and the post- streptococcal sequelae of rheumatic fever. The growth phase dependent regulation of protein expression allows for adaptation to various host tissues and represents a potential switch in the mode of infection reflected in the change in virulence factor expression.

5K23AI080716-03,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"A number of unique diagnostic and therapeutic advances in the area of human allergic disease are currently on the horizon. Ironically, our understanding the fundamental immune processes governing allergic disease pathology and treatment is still poorly understood. Anti-IgE, oral immunotherapy and CpG-based technologies have emerged as exciting treatment options for asthma, severe allergic rhinitis and food allergy. Preliminary evidence indicates that the immature human dendritic cell may be a critical target for these therapies (as well as classical subcutaneous immunotherapy). However, the mechanisms are not known. Studies have shown that dendritic cells express the high affinity IgE receptor (Fc(RI) and that this receptor correlates with serum IgE levels and allergic status. In addition, recent evidence has shown that the IgE receptor and the toll-like receptor may counter-regulate one another on dendritic cells. While it has long been understood that IgE mediated responses dominate in allergic disease, new evidence indicates that dendritic cells from allergic subjects have impaired toll-like receptor (TLR) mediated responses. These findings have led to the hypothesis that cross-regulatory mechanisms may exist between innate (TLR) and adaptive (IgE) immune receptors and their function on dendritic cells that may contribute to allergic disease manifestations. It has not yet been established whether there is a clinical correlate to the IgE/TLR interactions noted in vitro. For example, are TLR/IgE receptors on dendritic cells from allergic subjects phenotypically and/or functionally different from those of non-allergic individuals? Do dendritic cells obtained from one allergic disease population such as allergic rhinitis function distinctly from dendritic cells obtained from food allergic individuals or asthmatics? Does immunotherapy affect dendritic cell function or IgE/TLR receptor interactions? In this proposal we aim to define and contrast the major IgE and TLR receptor mediated responses in dendritic cells in three distinct disease groups namely; mild-moderate persistent asthma, peanut allergy and moderate-severe allergic rhinitis. We will compare the mechanisms governing dendritic cell function in each of these ailments in an effort to help uncover the pathologic basis of allergic disease. In doing so we aim to identify significant targets for therapy- some of which may already be exploited with classical and experimental versions of allergen immunotherapy. We will dissect the nature of the IgE receptor on human dendritic cells and construct a model for allergen interactions. We will analyze components of dendritic cell signaling events. Finally, we will specifically investigate dendritic cell immune mechanisms that are essential to clinically successful allergen immunotherapy. The goal of this project is to expand our knowledge of human dendritic cell immune function as it relates to allergic disease and mechanisms of allergen immunotherapy.

5U19AI095261-02,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"The primary hypothesis to be tested in this project is when milk allergic individuals undergo oral  immunotherapy (OIT), the induction of milk-specific regulatory T cells will predict those individuals who  achieve the most complete and lasting clinical tolerance. In order to test this hypothesis, we propose to  recruit 60 milk allergic children and adults (>15 years) who are very unlikely to outgrow their milk allergy  without an intervention. These individuals will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either active treatment  with milk OIT or placebo treatment. They will undergo three oral challenges to milk (the placebo group will  have only two challenges) to define their clinical sensitivity before treatment, after reaching maintenance for  about three months, and - if they become less sensitive - again after a three month period of avoidance. In  this way, we expect to define groups who: 1. fail to improve or are unable to reach maintenance; 2. Improve  but relapse after avoidance; 3. Achieve more lasting tolerance. We will compare these clinical outcomes to  changes in the frequency and function of CD4 T cell subsets, including those that produce cytokines (T  effectors), and those that are regulatory - defined by their expression of specific proteins (CD25, FoxP3) and  not others (CD127) - as well as by their functional capacity to suppress other T cells. We will also study  global gene expression changes in T cell subsets during OIT to investigate other potential mechanisms of  OIT. We will attempt to test the hypothesis that an expansion in numbers of a specific T cell subset, such as  the regulatory subset, occurs as a result of incorporating a greater diversity of T cells into that subset and  examine the kinship between different T cell subsets.

5R01AI091957-02,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Iron participates in a wide variety of cellular reactions and is an essential element for nearly all organisms. Iron acquisition is problematic for pathogenic bacteria, which must compete with the host for limited amounts of available iron, and bacteria typically express high affinity transport systems that are specific for their ferric or ferous iron ligands. Feo is the major ferrous iron transport system in prokaryotic organisms. It is widely distributed in eubacteria and in the Archaea, suggesting that it is a very ancient class of iron transporter. Further, the FeoB protein has GTPase and GDI domains similar to eukaryotic G proteins, and Feo may represent a primitive ancestor of modern G proteins. Despite its ubiquitous nature and potential role in bacterial pathogenesis, little is known about its structure, mechanism of transport, and biological role. Thus, it is critical to characterize this protein and its role in ferrous iron transport.  These studies will be done in the pathogen Vibrio cholerae, a major cause of human morbidity and mortality. V. cholerae is an ideal model for these studies as we have the reagents and genetic tools to answer basic questions about Feo. Further, we can extend these studies to include questions about the role of Feo in host colonization and disease, which will lay the groundwork for developing new methods of blocking infection by V. cholerae.  Our first specific aim is to use genetic and biochemical approaches to characterize Feo structure and its mechanism of transport. These studies will help define the essential protein components of the Feo transporter and the critical regions and amino acids within each protein. Based on these results, we will be able to test models for Feo structure and function. Our second specific aim is to characterize the accessory ferrous iron transport protein, VciB. This may provide insight into how Feo obtains its ferrous iron ligand in the periplasm. Third, we will define the mechanism of regulation of expression of the feo operon and determine its pattern of expression when the bacteria are within the host. These data will provide new information about how pathogenic bacteria coordinate the expression of their iron transport genes to allow optimal utilization of available iron sources and will also help define the environmental signals the bacteria encounter in the host.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Obtaining essential iron from the host is a critical step in production of disease by bacterial pathogens. Characterizing the ferrous iron uptake system Feo in Vibrio cholerae will provide important information about an iron transporter found in many bacterial pathogens, and it will further our knowledge of the organism that causes cholera. Because no system comparable to Feo is found in the human, this iron transport system may represent a new class of targets for antimicrobial therapy.",Characterization Of The Ferrous Iron Transporter Feo In Vibrio Cholerae,2010,2015,"Payne, Shelley M.","University of Texas, Austin",Austin,TX,51,1,-1,1534

5P01AG021601-09,National Institute On Aging,109,"Prions are infectious proteins that cause age-dependent neurodegeneration in humans and animals. The accumulation of an alternatively folded isoform of the prion protein (PrPSc) in the brains of humans and animals is the hallmark of the prion disorders that include Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). The prion diseases are invariably fatal and no effective treatment exists. In this application, we propose to continue our studies directed toward devising effective medications for the treatment of CJD. Toward this goal, we want to identify several compounds that either alone or in combination substantially prolong the incubation times in transgenic mice. A model for our proposed research is reflected in our earlier work with bigenic mouse expressing an inducible PrP transgene. These studies showed a substantial prolongation of the incubation time by doxycycline-mediated inhibition of PrPc expression. Toward achieving this goal, we plan to adapt human (Hu) prion protein (PrP) based assays to the High Throughput Screening (HTS) of chemical libraries. Initially, we plan to continue using prion-infected mouse (Mo) neuroblastoma cells designated ScN2a for HTS studies. At the same time, we propose to use uninfected, human (Hu) glioblastoma cells in our HTS search for compounds that decrease HuPrPc levels. In addition, we propose to create cultured cells that propagate either wt Hu or chimeric Hu/Mo CJD prions. These novel cell lines will be used for HTS of chemical libraries. In the proposed studies, both protease-sensitive (s) and resistant (r) PrPSc will be measured in both dividing and non-dividing cells. Potent, non-toxic lead compounds with anti-prion activity will be chemically and computationally optimized by appropriate Structure-Activity-Relationship (SAR) studies. Some computational analyses will focus on the permeability of lead compounds across the bloodbrain- barrier (BBB) and other computational studies on the formation of PrPSc as well as structural models of this protein. Because of problems that plague prion-infected cultured cell assays, we propose to develop additional assays for HTS that include adaptation of an amyloid seeding assay (ASA) using HuPrPSc to seed the polymerization of recombinant (rec) HuPrP as well as a humanized version of a fluorescence polarization (FP) assay that measures the binding of PrP peptides to HuPrPSc. We also propose to use transgenic (Tg) mice expressing either a chimeric Hu/Mo PrP or wt HuPrP that are susceptible to Hu CJD prions.

In addition to the natural routes of  intoxication (food borne botulism, cutaneous botulism, and infant botulism), inhalation botulism has been  proposed as a delivery mechanism for malicious activity. Current vaccines and therapies against botulism  are in limited supply for the general public. There are seven serotypes of BoNTs (termed A-G) based upon  cross sero-protection. As proof of principle, a subunit vaccine was been produced that protected against  intoxication by the seven serotypes of BoNT. This application will continue to develop vaccines and  therapies against botulism and characterize the BoNT dual-receptors on neurons.  The aims of this application are to optimize subunit BoNT vaccines that neutralize the seven serotypes of  BoNT, to characterize a new BoNT serotype, to determine the molecular basis for the neutralization  capacity of BoNT anti-sera, and to use an inhalation mouse BoNT model to test the efficacy of BoNT  vaccines and determine the role of BoNT dual-receptors in inhalation botulism. A high throughput screen will  identify small molecule inhibitors of BoNT entry into neurons, while the molecular and cellular properties of  BoNT binding to their dual-receptors will be determined.

5R01AI024998-18,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Many acute viral infections induce early T cell independent polyclonal B cell activation and production of antigen-specific IgA or IgG prior to the formation of classical T cell dependent B germinal centers. However, the necessary signals for initiation of early T cell independent class switch recombination (CSR) are not known. The objective of this application is to determine the essential pathways that drive T cell independent B cell activation and IgA CSR. We propose to utilize the murine model of rotavirus infection in which Peyer's patch (PP) T cell independent polyclonal B cell activation is induced within 48 hours after viral exposure followed by production of rotavirus- specific IgA. Rotavirus induced B cell activation in vitro requires dendritic cells. Rotavirus antigen is present in PP dendritic cells in vivo and these cells are activated at the time B cell activation occurs, suggesting that dendritic cells are important modulators of the B cell response to rotavirus. Our finding that B cell activation is dependent on the structural integrity of the rotavirus particles suggested the possibility that rotavirus induces dendritic cell responses as a result of pattern recognition. Preliminary experiments demonstrate that lack of MyD88 expression results in an ablation of B cell activation and substantial reduction in intestinal IgA levels. We find that a mutation in the B cell activating factor (BAFF) signaling pathway also results in the ablation of B cell activation, suggesting a potential link between MyD88 and BAFF. Several days following PP B cell activation there is an increase of TGF-&#191; expression and numbers of IgA+ B cells in the PP, suggesting TGF-&#191; also plays an important role in the PP polyclonal response to rotavirus. Therefore, we hypothesize that dendritic cells modulate the production of rapid T cell independent pathogen-specific antibody in the PP through induction of a polyclonal B cell response that results from MyD88, BAFF, and TGF-&#191; signaling independent of an antigen-specific BCR. We will test this hypothesis by using both in vitro and in vivo approaches to pursue the following three aims: Aim 1. Determine whether rotavirus induces dendritic cell MyD88 signaling that drives B cell  responses. Aim 2. Determine whether MyD88 signaling results in BAFF and TGF-ss production. Aim 3. Characterize the polyclonal B cell responses to rotavirus. The studies proposed in this application are of importance in addressing unanswered questions regarding the molecular mechanisms of T cell independent antibody induction in the intestine.

2P42ES010337-11A1,National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences,25,"PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):  Arsenic is one of the world's most ubiquitous environmental toxicants, with humans being exposed from air, food and water. However, elevated arsenic levels in drinking water are the major cause of toxicity, and are a health issue in many of the communities in this country that are in proximity to Superfund sites. Chronic  arsenic toxicity and the health issues linked to exposure have been termed arsenicosis by the World Health Organization, with toxicity being seen from skin manifestations to liver fibrosis and cancer. A prevailing theory in arsenic toxicity is its ability to induce oxidative stress, which then initiates cellular and molecular changes leading to tissue damage. Using new animal models that show sustained elevations in serum  bilirubin, a potent and natural antioxidant, experiments will be conducted in collaboration with our SRP research colleagues to examine the impact of bilirubin induced antioxidant protection on the development of arsenic induced liver fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Steady-state levels of serum bilirubin are maintained by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase IAI (UGT1A1) metabolism. By modifying the expression levels of UGT1A1 in humanized UGT1 mice or through conditional deletion ofthe liver Ugt1 locus, the steady-state levels of serum bilirubin can be reset in both neonatal and adult mice, allowing us to investigate the actions of arsenic in inducing cellular programs responsible for gene expression, fibrosis and HCC. We will characterize the cellular and molecular actions of arsenic in humanized UGT1 (hUGTI) mice where it is shown that oral arsenic intake to neonatal mice dramatically induces intestinal UGT1A1 leading to a reversal in neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. These studies will provide new molecular mechanisms on the potential oxidative actions of acute oral arsenic exposure on induction of the human UGT1A1 gene. We will utilize a new conditional knockout model of the murine Ugtl locus showing elevated bilirubin levels when the Ugt1 locus is deleted in liver, generating UgtlAIHEP mice. In collaborations with Drs. Karin and Seki, antioxidant protection initiated by hUGTI mice expressing the promoter defective UGT1A1*28 allele and UgtIAHEP mice will be used in combination to examine the contribution of elevated serum bilirubin towards preventing genetically induced oxidative damage and arsenic initiated liver fibrosis and cancer.

During the same period, there has been an equally alarming decline in the number of new antibiotics receiving approval for clinical use. One reason underlying both trends is that current genomic and other analyses have produced disappointingly few new single drug targets within bacteria, a situation that calls for renewed efforts to develop novel drug target identification strategies such as rational ways to develop combination therapies. We propose one such method here: to deploy genome-scale in silico models of metabolism and other tools from systems biology to identify synthetic lethal and synthetic sick gene pairs within the metabolic networks of pathogenic Enterobacteria. Model predictions would then be tested experimentally by constructing putative pairs in Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Pairs confirmed to be synthetically lethal in both organisms would then be subjected to virtual and high-throughput screening to identify broad-spectrum two-component formulations which inhibit growth or kill multiple members of Enterobacteria.

This Phase 2 proposal will serve to accomplish the major milestones necessary for commercialization of this therapeutic approach for severe food allergy. In Phase 1, the lead molecule (AraH2)2-Fc?1 (AraH2-G) was constructed and tested as a model for other peanut allergens. In Phase 2, we will define and generate the optimal product for IND-enabling studies and clinical development by accomplishing the following Specific Aims. In Aim 1 we will establish research-level expression systems and characterize several types of the key peanut allergen-Fc?1 proteins. These will include (a) production of classic dimers, beyond (AraH2)2-G; (b) monomeric AraH-G proteins in which a single AraH protein is joined to the Fc?1 dimer; (c) polymeric (AraH2+AraH1)2-G; and (d) double-dimers, in which an AraH dimer is joined to two Fc?1 dimers.

In Aim 2 we will test the hypothesis  that cross-desensitization can be generated for AraH-G proteins. If it does, this strategy could be game changing as it would simplify overall food allergy immunotherapy, speed product commercialization and decrease the cost of the therapy. Aim 3 will define the optimal clinical candidate(s) chimeric peanut-human FcG protein(s) through a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments defining both their safety and efficacy; safety being their inability to act as allerge while efficacy being their ability to induce tolerance to peanut in previously sensitized animals. The exact experiments and the likely lead compound(s) will be greatly impacted if we observe cross-desensitization in Aim 2. Finally, in Aim 4 we will establish stable high-expressing GMP-quality cell lines producing the final clinical candidate(s) identified by accomplishing Specific Aims 1-3. Success in Phase 2 will set the stage for production of material for formal IND-enabling studies and GMP material for a first-in human trial designed to demonstrate the lack of allergenicity of the clinical candidate. If successful with peanut, extending this approach to othe key food antigens will be relatively straightforward.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Therapeutic peanut allergen-Fc-gamma chimeric proteins to treat food allergy Effective treatments to for severe allergic food allergy represent a major unmet  medical need. As opposed to inhalant allergy, standard allergen immunotherapy has proven too dangerous to undertake for food allergy. Severe food allergy affects 2.5% of the US population, an estimated 8 million persons, including 3 million children, resulting in more than 200,000 annual US emergency department visits. Additionally, fear of unsuspected exposures places a large emotional burden on the patient and their family and has had a wide societal impact in schools and other public forums. Peanut is the most prevalent and profound food allergy and thus we have chosen to address peanut both as key food allergen and as a model for other important food allergens. The goal of this proposal is to develop and commercialize a safe and efficient peanut allergen vaccine platform employing of peanut-allergen human Fc?1 fusion proteins capable of being used to induce allergic tolerance to the food allergen.",Therapeutic Peanut Allergen Fc Gamma Chimeric Proteins To Treat Peanut Allergy,2010,2014,"Saxon, Andrew Sigal, Nolan  ","Tunitas Therapeutics, Inc.",San Francisco,CA,6,1,-1,-1
5R01AI072021-05,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Amebiasis ranks second as a protozoan cause of death. Entamoeba histolytica, the etiologic agent, is an intestinal ameba that acquires nutrients by phagocytosis of colonic bacteria, and phagocytosis of host cells by E. histolytica is a prominent feature of invasive amebiasis. Despite its importance, little is known about the mechanism of E. histolytica phagocytosis. Entamoeba histolytica induces host cell apoptosis, resulting in host cell surface changes that engage unknown amebic phagocytosis receptors. In mammals, collectin family members (e.g., mannose binding lectin (MBL)) and the structurally related protein C1q bind to apoptotic cells, and initiate phagocytosis by interaction of their conserved collagenous tails with calreticulin. Calreticulin, which has no transmembrane domain, serves as a bridge between collectins and the macrophage receptor CD91. Preliminary data show that: 1) C1q, MBL, and collectin tails stimulate E. histolytica phagocytosis, 2) C1q and MBL compete for binding to the surface of E. histolytica, 3) calreticulin is present on the amebic surface and re-localizes to the phagocytic cup during interaction with apoptotic cells, 4) human C1q and the collectins MBL and SP-A compete for binding to immobilized amebic calreticulin, and 5) specific E. histolytica surface proteins interact with calreticulin. Therefore, host collectins bound to apoptotic cells and bacteria may stimulate E. histolytica phagocytosis by interaction of their collagenous tail domain with an amebic receptor. Calreticulin is one logical candidate, and, if calreticulin participates in amebic phagocytosis, it is hypothesized to do so by bridging between collectins and a calreticulin receptor on the amebic surface. The specific aims test these hypotheses. In aim 1, purified collectins, C1q, and collagenous collectin tails will be used to test if E. histolytica has a receptor for the collectin tail that mediates engulfment of apoptotic cells. Except for C1q, the collectins also opsonize bacteria in mucosal secretions. Therefore, studies will be performed to test if E. histolytica engulfs apoptotic cells and bacteria via the same mechanism. In aim 2, RNA-mediated interference and an alternative gene silencing method will be used to determine if calreticulin participates in E. histolytica phagocytosis. Recombinant calreticulin will be used for binding studies to determine if E. histolytica has a calreticulin receptor. In aim 3, either a collectin or a calreticulin receptor will be identified. The decision of which to pursue will depend on the results from aims 1 and 2. In either case, cross-linking methods and complementary affinity-based methods will be combined with mass spectrometry to identify interacting amebic surface proteins. Successful completion of the proposed studies will provide a molecular understanding of E. histolytica phagocytosis, and will substantially augment our knowledge of how E. histolytica interacts with the host and with colonic bacteria. Furthermore, new insights into the pathogenesis of amebiasis that result from these studies may suggest novel methods for its treatment and prevention.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Entamoeba histolytica, a single-celled intestinal parasite that causes invasive amebiasis (a disease Characterized by bloody diarrhea and liver abscesses), engulfs killed cells during invasion through host tissues.

5R01AI053724-10,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"The protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica causes an estimated 50 million cases of invasive disease annually. The most common manifestations of amebic infection are colonic disease and liver abscesses. Our goal is to identify novel virulence determinants in E. histolytica with the aim of understanding the molecular basis of amebic pathogenesis. We have previously developed and used microarray technology to identify genes whose expression is restricted to virulent strains and conditions. One such gene, encoding an E. histolytica serine, threonine, isoleucine, rich protein (EhSTIRP) is expressed only in virulent strains and conditions and has very low to no expression in non-virulent strains and conditions. Preliminary data indicate that parasites in which EhSTIRP is downregulated have decreased adhesion and virulence in vitro. Additionally, in EhSTIRP downregulated parasites have reduced expression of cytoskeletal genes. Our hypothesis is that EhSTIRP is a key virulence determinant in E. histolytica with potential roles in parasite adhesion and signaling relevant to amebic pathogenesis. We propose to further characterize the contribution of EhSTIRP to E. histolytica virulence in vitro, determine whether EhSTIRP is necessary for virulence in vivo, identify the localization of EhSTIRP during host invasion, characterize domains of EhSTIRP with relevance to parasite virulence, and identify amebic proteins that interact with EhSTIRP. We will use genetic and biochemical approaches to dissect gene function, live cell imaging to determine EhSTIRP localization during amebic host cell interaction and microarray analysis to define parasite transcriptome changes associated with genetic manipulation of EhSTIRP. These approaches promise to identify the role of EhSTIRP in amebic pathogenesis and dissect the genetic and biochemical network that is associated with EhSTIRP and which regulates virulence in Entamoeba histolytica. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Entamoeba histolytica is an important pathogen and has an impact on human health on a global scale. The main disease manifestations are dysentery and liver abscesses. Although the majority of disease is in developing countries, this parasite can cause infections anywhere that water purification systems get adversely affected. Events such as the Tsunami or upheaval in the political and social infrastructure of a region can allow disease to emerge.

5R01ES020506-02,National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences,25,"Chronic arsenic exposure from drinking water is a serious public health issue in the U.S. and worldwide, as nearly 200 million people worldwide are chronically exposed to this class I human carcinogen. Arsenic increases risk for a wide array of human diseases, including cancers of the skin, bladder, and kidney; however, the mechanisms of arsenic toxicity are unclear. We hypothesize that telomeres may play a critical role in cancer-related arsenic toxicity. Telomeres are central to the regulation of genome stability, and arsenic has detrimental effects on telomeres and telomerase, the primary telomere maintenance enzyme, in a wide variety of experimental settings. In this study, we propose to characterize the relationships among arsenic exposure, various telomere-related traits, and arsenic-related outcomes in a highly feasible and efficient manner, using existing data from a longitudinal cohort study of As exposure in Bangladesh (n=27,000) with ~6-8 years of follow-up data. The proposed study uses a case-cohort design, in which we sample individuals from the cohort study to create three case groups (1,000 incident skin lesion cases, 200 incident non-melanoma skin cancer (MNSC), and 400 deaths) and a single control group (a random sample of 1000 cohort members). Using prospective blood samples, we will measure telomere length, serum markers of telomere dysfunction, and telomerase expression (for a subset with available RNA). Using baseline arsenic exposure data measured in drinking water, urine, and blood, we will assess the effect of arsenic on the measured telomere-related traits among controls and each case group. We will also assess the association between baseline telomere-related traits and our three outcomes of interest. In a second component of this work, we will measure telomere length and telomerase expression in MNSC tissue and adjacent normal tissue obtained from skin biopsies carried out for MNSC cases in this cohort. Telomere-related traits will be compared between normal and cancerous skin and among cancer subtypes, and the association between arsenic exposure and telomere- related traits in skin will be assessed. Finally, we will use existing genome-wide data on germline genetic variants to identify genetic determinants of our telomere-related traits. Several secondary aims will also be addressed. We will (1) determine if telomere-related traits mediate the effect of arsenic on health outcomes, (2) determine if arsenic effects telomere attrition rate, and (3) test telomere-related traits for association with blood levels of antioxidants. This project is a critical step towards understanding the mechanisms of arsenic toxicity in humans. The utility of all telomere-related measures derived from this work will increase as additional follow-up data accumulates in this ongoing cohort study, allowing further study of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and other arsenic-related chronic diseases",A Study Of Telomeres In An Arsenic-Exposed Bangladesh Cohort,2011,2016,"Pierce, Brandon Lee",University of Chicago,Chicago,IL,17,1,377,5322
5R01AI081724-03,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Shigella, a major etiologic agent of diarrhea, dysentery, and mortality worldwide, causes disease by invading and disseminating through the colonic mucosa. Shigella sp. are CDC/NIAID priority pathogens. After inducing their own entry into cells, bacteria move to the cell periphery by actin-based motility. At the cell periphery, they push out against the plasma membrane, forming cell extensions that are engulfed by uninfected adjacent cells, whereupon the cycle of cell-to-cell dissemination is repeated.  Shigella and other intracellular pathogens enhance the process of infection by activating normal host cell signaling pathways. To activate these pathways, these microorganisms secrete into the host cell effector proteins that modulate the activity of specific host proteins. Whereas the molecular signaling events involved in S. flexneri entry into cells have been studied extensively, the signaling events involved in S. flexneri dissemination from one cell into an adjacent cell are poorly understood. In this application, we propose a detailed investigation of the molecular signaling events that occur during S. flexneri intercellular dissemination, using both targeted and genome-wide approaches.  Our preliminary data indicate that the cellular diaphanous formin proteins mDia1 and mDia2, which function in the stress fiber formation pathway, are required for efficient dissemination through cell monolayers. Our data also indicate that the secreted S. flexneri proteins IpgB2, OspE1, and OspE2 are required for this process and that these proteins trigger partially redundant host signaling pathways that likely involve mDia1 and mDia2. In addition, our data indicate that IpgB2/OspE1/OspE2-independent mechanisms also contribute to dissemination. Our targeted approaches will test the hypothesis that IpgB2, OspE1, and OspE2 activate specific steps in the stress fiber formation pathway. Our genome-wide approach will examine the human genome for additional factors involved in intercellular dissemination. Our specific aims are: 1. Characterize the mechanisms of S. flexneri IpgB2 activation of the stress fiber formation pathway; 2. Characterize the roles of secreted S. flexneri effector proteins OspE1 and OspE2 in intercellular dissemination; and, 3. Identify and characterize other host factors required for S. flexneri intercellular spread using a genome- wide human siRNA screen;  Our approaches are designed to generate insights not only into the molecular signaling that is required for intercellular dissemination of S. flexneri, but also into fundamental mechanisms of eukaryotic cellular and intercellular processes.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The human pathogen Shigella is a bacterium that causes diarrhea by infecting cells that line the human intestinal tract and disseminating through intestinal tissue by mechanisms that are poorly understood. The bacterium promotes dissemination by producing molecules that trigger specific responses in the infected cells that enhance the movement of bacteria into adjacent uninfected cells; we propose detailed studies into the molecular signaling involved in the dissemination of Shigella through tissue.

5R01ES017260-04,National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences,25,"The overall goal of this project is to understand the mechanisms by which exposure to arsenic accelerates or aggravates atherosclerosis. Exposure to arsenic-contaminated water is a global problem and results in the manifestation of multiple cardiovascular symptoms including hypertension, stroke, and myocardial infarction. Increased atherosclerosis is likely to be the major underlying cause of the increased risk of cardiovascular disease in an arsenic-exposed population. Accordingly, the intent of this proposal is to understand the mechanism by which arsenic accelerates or exacerbates atherogenesis in a well-controlled animal model. On the basis of supportive preliminary evidence, our central hypothesis is that arsenic promotes atherogenic changes in endothelial cells and in macrophages by inducing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which in turn triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR). To test this hypothesis, we will: (1) delineate the contribution of ER stress and UPR to arsenic-mediated endothelial cell and macrophage activation; (2) examine the progression of atherogenesis in arsenic-exposed mice; and (3) elucidate the role of UPR in exacerbation of atherogenesis by arsenic. To accomplish these aims, we will examine whether exposure to arsenic induces ER stress and triggers UPR in endothelial cells and macrophages. We will identify which aspects of the UPR are triggered by arsenic and whether ER stress contributes to arsenic-induced activation of endothelial cells and foam cell formation. To assess how arsenic affects atherogenesis, we will examine early, intermediate, and advanced lesions for lipid accumulation, cellularity, inflammation, and oxidative stress in apoE-null mice exposed to arsenic. Bone marrow transplants from arsenic-exposed to non-exposed mice will be performed to delineate the specific contribution of macrophages to arsenic toxicity. To identify the in vivo role of UPR in arsenic toxicity, we will examine which components of ER stress and UPR are activated in the lesions of arsenic-exposed animals, and whether inhibition of the adaptive phase of UPR by deleting the ATF3 gene accelerates or treatment with chemical chaperones of protein folding inhibits lesion formation. Results of this project may lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms by which arsenic affects atherogenesis and how they could be therapeutically prevented. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Large sections of human population in the US as well as Asia are exposed to high levels of arsenic in drinking water. Previous epidemiological studies show that people exposed to high levels of arsenic have a higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which arsenic elevates cardiovascular disease risk are not known. This project is designed to mimic human exposures to arsenic in an animal model and test whether exposure to arsenic increases the rate and/or the extent of atherosclerotic lesion formation in atherosclerosis-prone mice. The project seeks to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms by which arsenic increases atherosclerosis; which processes are affected; and which cellular and molecular mechanisms mediate the cardiovascular toxicity of arsenic. Results obtained from this project are likely to provide novel models for testing atherogenic effects of arsenic exposure, in developing a better understanding of how arsenic worsens atherosclerosis and how the atherogenic effects of arsenic could be ameliorated and treated.",Atherogenic Mechanisms Of Arsenic,2009,2014,"Srivastava, Sanjay ",University of Louisville,Louisville,KY,21,1,962,3963
5R01AI083241-02,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"The long-term objective of this research is to understand how the environmental bacterium Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) adapts to life within mammalian cells to become a human pathogen. Lm is a facultative intracellular bacterium that survives as a saprophyte in soil but is capable of transitioning into a pathogen upon entry into a mammalian host. As a pathogen, Lm remains an increasingly important agent of serious food- borne infections and has been responsible for some of the largest food safety recalls in U.S. history. Central to Lm's ability to cause disease is the regulated transport of virulence factors across the bacterial membrane and the rigid cell wall; this critical process has not been well characterized in Gram-positive bacteria. This proposal focuses on molecular and mechanistic analyses of PrsA2, a post-translocation secretion chaperone with peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase activity that is essential for Lm virulence. Lm strains lacking PrsA2 function are severely attenuated in mouse models of infection and exhibit reduced secretion and activity of at least two key Lm virulence gene products, the cholesterol-dependent cytolysin listeriolysin O (LLO) and the broad specificity phospholipase PC-PLC. Both of these gene products contribute to Lm's ability to gain access to the host cell cytosol and to spread of the bacteria into new host cells. Preliminary experiments indicate that PrsA2 directly regulates LLO stability, and that PrsA2 may be required for the secretion and/or activity of additional Lm factors with important roles in bacterial virulence. The experiments outlined within this proposal will define the role of PrsA2 in regulating the activity of Lm secreted proteins used to secure the bacterium's intracellular replication niche. Aim 1 will determine the molecular mechanism by which PrsA2 regulates the secretion and activity of LLO and PC-PLC. Aim 2 will examine a number of potential PrsA2 substrates with roles in bacterial virulence for direct PrsA2 interactions. Experiments will further determine the nature of a suppressor mutation that partially compensates for PrsA2 function. Aim 3 experiments focus on the molecular analysis of PrsA2 functional domains based on structural modeling of PrsA2. The ultimate goal of the specific aims will be to elucidate how PrsA2 modulates the secretion and/or activity of virulence factors to promote bacterial pathogenesis in mammalian hosts.",Post-Translation Regulation Of Listeria Monocytogenes Virulence Factors,2011,2015,"Freitag, Nancy Elizabeth",University of Illinois At Chicago,Chicago,IL,17,1,-1,1462
5U01AI082120-04,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"This proposal brings together investigators from Mayo Clinic, Rutgers University, and Walter Reed Army Institute of Research with expertise in computational and medicinal chemistry, structural biology, biochemistry, molecular biology and immunology to develop broad-spectrum therapy against ribosome inactivating proteins. Our primary goal is to develop second-generation small-molecule inhibitors of Shiga-like toxin 2 (Stx2) and ricin. Both toxins are category B agents that can cause significant morbidity and mortality. Currently, there is no FDA-approved vaccine or therapeutics that can protect against either toxin. Traditional approaches to ricin/Shiga toxin inhibitors use either a brute-force screening method to identify leads or a structure-based method to identify analogs of substrate adenine. The toxin-transport-system-targeting inhibitors with IC5O values of 25-50 ?M identified from the screening method suffer from the challenge in optimizing the leads into nanomolar inhibitors because of the lack of the structural information on the transport system. All adenine-like inhibitors reported to date are either small molecules with submillimolar potencies or oligonucleotides that can neutralize the extracellular toxin to prevent further intoxication but cannot effectively cross the plasma membrane to rescue intoxicated cells. This application innovatively uses the molecular clip approach that identifies small molecules able to lock TyrSo of ricin (or its equivalent Tyryy of Stx2) into the conformation that blocks the function of the protein. Such inhibitors do not have to be adenine-like for direct competition with RNA for binding to the toxin, thereby avoiding the permeability problem of the known ricin/Shiga inhibitors. This novel approach has already culminated in small molecules that inhibited both ricin and Stx2 at a drug concentration of 10 nM and showed ~io% cell protection against ricin and 20% cell protection against Stx2 at a drug concentration of 300 nM. In this context, we propose to optimize our inhibitor leads to improve their affinity for the active site of Stx2/ricin and their cell permeability, measure the potency of the inhibitors in antagonizing Stx2/ricin in cell free and cell based assays and examine the inhibitors in combination with a ricin vaccine under development for synergistic efficacy to prevent or alleviate ricin intoxication. The significant outcomes of this project are (i) small molecules that inhibit both Shiga and ricin at nanomolar drug concentrations in vivo, enabling a therapy effective against multiple toxins; (2) knowledge useful for identification and optimization of other small-molecule inhibitors of toxins that target ribosomes; (3) a proof-of- concept for use of small-molecule inhibitors as adjuncts to immunization to explore the synergy of small-molecule and vaccine therapies. Ultimately the work proposed here will result in the development several highly potent and specific inhibitors of toxin-mediated injury that are potential drug candidates.

Phase 2 (The Sensor): This work, will utilize an ultra sensitive electrochemical sensing platform based on aligned MWCNT for voltammetric analysis of pesticides. We will examine the capability and performance of the carbon nano-array based sensing unit and develop simultaneous and continuous detection of multiple pesticides.

Application of the Project to Product Development and Commercialization: Statement of the problem; our nation's food and water quality is at risk since we cannot afford the man power and time it takes to sample and analyze water using current methods. The risk pesticides pose has been grossly underestimated. A recent study, of the U.S. 2009 Geological survey done by NOAA Fisheries Service and Washington State University, indicates that the combined effect of multiple pesticides is far more dangerous to the health than was estimated by analyzing the results for the effect of each pesticide individually(1). In fact when juvenile salmon were exposed to only two pesticides at once they immediately died. These were common pesticides that were thought to be safe. These pesticides are linked to ADHD in children (2).This lack in capability of providing comprehensive pesticide testing for the health of the public is not limited  to Oregon; it is a national problem.     Solution: A field applicable real-time remote monitoring device to detect pesticides in water and food would allow Food Processors, DEQ, EPA, and NIEH researchers to get enough data on the relationship between environmental and industrial or agricultural factors and specific mechanisms that effect water and food quality, to effect change. Currently there is not enough data to develop comprehensive and effective plans for managing pesticides. Also real-time, sensitive to ppt, measurement is needed for food processors to adjust processes in time to lower the amount of pesticides in food. Dahl Natural, ASU and OSU are partnering to demonstrate feasibility of this technology so that it can be commercialized to provide a solution to this health and environmental threatening problem.     Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: Unique to this solution is the ability of this device to be deployed in an aquatic environment for from one to two years without the need for servicing until the end of that time period. In addition the data can be remotely sent too many different data bases at once. Hence the commercial application and benefits to the NIEH and the public are many and include food processing, waste water monitoring and alarm systems, superfund site monitoring, timely individual wastewater discharge permits issued, establishment of a comprehensive data base for NIEH, DEQ, EPA and University researchers.     The market for pesticide testing is over 1 Billion dollars a year. The low cost of the sensors and dramatic cost saving per     test (from $200 to $600 a day per pesticide for one mean sample to over 50 mean samples per day for as little as $30.00) as well as increase access to internet /intranet accessible data.

Guerrerio, with the necessary knowledge, skills, and experience required to transition to a position as an independent researcher in the field of allergy and immunology. Dr. Guerrerio outlines a five-year plan to investigate the basic mechanism by which TGF-&#191; regulates immunity, and specifically how it participates in the pathogenesis of Th2-mediated disease. This work will be performed under the mentorship of Dr. Harry C Dietz, Victor McKusick Professor of Medicine and Genetics and an investigator in the Howard Hughes Medical Institute at Johns Hopkins University. Dr. Dietz has an impressive track record of mentoring young investigators for successful careers in academic medicine, including those funded under the K award mechanism. Dr. Guerrerio also has the support of a team of extraordinary physician scientists at Johns Hopkins including Dr. Jonathan Powell, Dr. Zhou Zhu, and Dr. Robert Wood. All of these individuals have committed their time, resources, and expertise to facilitate Dr. Guerrerio's career development and research goals. In addition, the candidate will acquire additional skills and training through didactic coursework at the highly regarded Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.       The candidate's past academic experiences underscore her commitment to academic medicine and her desire to acquire rigorous and complete scientific training. She completed the NIH-sponsored Medical Scientist Training Program at Johns Hopkins University and did her graduate work under the mentorship of Dr. Dietz. During graduate school, she performed very basic research in the mechanisms of RNA stability, and discovered a novel mRNA decay pathway, termed nonstop decay, that appears to be a new mechanism to regulate gene expression. Using murine models, she also demonstrated how another RNA surveillance mechanism, nonsense mediated decay, is required for normal lymphocyte development and proper allelic exclusion. She completed both a residency in Pediatrics and a fellowship in Allergy and Immunology at Johns Hopkins University. During fellowship, she became interested in food allergy and mucosal tolerance and has led several studies to investigate the role of human dendritic cells and basophils in the pathogenesis of food allergy. Dr. Guerrerio joined the faculty at Johns Hopkins as an Assistant Professor in July 2009. Her research experiences have afforded her with a unique background in molecular biology, genetics, immunology, and both human and murine models of disease. She is now poised to apply these skills, under the guidance of her mentors, to study the basic immunologic mechanisms that lead to loss of tolerance and development of food allergy.       The research in this proposal will focus on the role of TGF-&#191; in the development of allergic disease. The scientific approach will involve the study of Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS), a newly described autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the TGF-&#191; receptors, as a model system. LDS appears to be the first Mendelian disorder associated with the development of food allergy and eosinophilic esophagitis, and offers an unparalleled opportunity to study the role of TGF-&#191; in the human immune system. Specific Aims include: I): Investigate the signaling alterations in human lymphocytes caused by LDS mutations and how they lead to increased Th2 effector responses II): Define the biochemical and cellular events leading to the increased propensity for Th2-mediated disease in LDS mice, and how this process can be mitigated by pharmacologic inhibition of TGF-&#191; signaling. The scientific training obtained through this grant will lead to publications, data, and experience that will enable the candidate to secure independent NIH funding within the next 3-4 years and establish herself an independent physician scientist.       Food allergy and eosinophilic esophagitis have become increasingly common clinical problems for which there is no known cure. We have recently identified the TGF-&#191; pathway to be specifically involved in the development of these disorders. In this proposal, we will seek to understand the mechanism by which alterations in TGF-&#191; signaling predispose to allergic disease, and how these pathways might be manipulated for therapeutic benefit.",Investigation Of The Role Of TGF Beta  In TH2-Mediated Disease,2011,2015,"Guerrerio, Pamela Ann",Johns Hopkins University,Baltimore,MD,25,1,97,5345
5R01AI084415-03,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"This proposal outlines a comprehensive plan to genetically dissect the fatty acid metabolism of the human pathogen Toxoplasma gondii. T. gondii infection is widespread in the U.S. (22% of the population is chronically infected) and while usually benign can cause life-threatening disease in immunosuppressed individuals (e.g. those with HIV-AIDS, transplant recipients, or hematological malignancies). Congenital transmission of T. gondii is also a major public health concern. Highly virulent parasite strains have been recently identified as the cause of severe and recurring eye infections that ultimately lead to blindness. T. gondii also has the potential to cause significant waterborne outbreaks and has been listed by the CDC as a potential bioterrorism pathogen (appendix B). The currently available treatment has frequent and significant adverse effects and shows no efficacy in chronic infection, thus allowing for recrudescence of the active infection. Thus, new drugs are urgently needed. The discovery of a chloroplast-like organelle in apicomplexan parasites provides several promising parasite-specific target pathways for drug development. Among these pathways is a bacterial type II fatty acid synthesis pathway, and enzymes in this pathway have been the subject of intensive medicinal chemistry efforts to develop drugs against malaria and toxoplasmosis. However, what the precise function of this pathway for T. gondii and related apicomplexan parasites is remains unclear. Furthermore, the parasite genome encodes additional enzyme systems that might supply fatty acids either by synthesis or salvage from the host cell. A detailed understanding of the function and relative importance of these pathways is needed to guide the drug development effort to the most promising targets. In this project we will use genetics and metabolomics to dissect the complex interaction of three individual pathways. Using a novel and highly efficient approach to engineer conditional T. gondii mutants we will rigorously test the importance and function of each individual pathway in vivo. We will determine the impact of the loss of specific pathways on the parasite fatty acid and lipid composition using unbiased metabolomic profiling. To define the interactions between individual pathways and between the parasite and its host cell we conduct metabolic flux studies using stable epitope tracing. Overall we expect the outlined studies to produce a detailed mechanistic understanding of fatty acid synthesis as an important part of parasite metabolism and metabolic host-parasite interaction. Mutant analysis will highlight truly essential components as potential pharmacological targets. We also expect that the genetic and metabolomic tools honed along the way will prove highly useful for the dissection of many facets of parasite biology beyond lipid metabolism.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will use modern genetic and metabolomic approaches to dissect the metabolism of the human pathogen Toxoplasma gondii. The studies will provide important information to guide the development of drug treatments and will lead to a detailed understanding of host-parasite interaction at the metabolic level.",Genetic Dissection Of Parasite Metabolism,2010,2015,"Striepen, Boris ",University of Georgia,Athens,GA,13,1,182,3961
5P20ES018175-03,National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences,25,"Both animal and in vitro studies support an association of low level arsenic exposure with impaired immune  function as reflected in suppression of innate immunity and increased pathogen load. The few epidemiologic  studies of this association are primarily from heavily exposed populations -and often involve small sample  sizes or rely on ecologic exposure measures, and may not be generalizable to other regions of the world.  Arsenic exposure in these heavily exposed populations has been variously associated with an increased risk  of respiratory infection, bronchiectasis, and parasitic infection as well as with changed markers of immune  function including, e.g., cytokine levels (IL-7, IL-2) and T-cell (CD4/CD8) ratios. The overall goal of this study  is to assess the relationship of environmentally relevant levels of arsenic with maternal and infant immune  function among 1,000 women and infants enrolled in an ongoing pregnancy cohort study of reproductive  toxicities of arsenic. This ongoing longitudinal study is being conducted among mother-infant pairs who are  residents of New Hampshire and obtain household water from wells which are a potential source of arsenic  exposure. Specifically, we will expand this ongoing study to test the following new hypotheses: (1) prenatal  and early life arsenic exposure (via water, food) is associated with an increased risk of infection during the  1st year of life; (2) arsenic exposure is associated with an increased risk of infection during pregnancy.  Secondarily, we will assess the relation of pre- and post-natal arsenic exposure with vaccine response at  age one year (antibody titers to tetanus and diphtheria) and whether individual variation in arsenic  metabolism (maternal urinary metabolite profiles and polymorphisms in arsenic metabolism genes) and other  factors (e.g., smoking, folate intake) modify the effects of arsenic on infant or maternal infection. Altered  immune function, particularly in pregnancy and early childhood, can have a profound impact on both  perinatal and subsequent health. To the best of our knowledge, studying immune effects of arsenic in a U.S.  population of mothers and infants with both individual biomarkers of exposure and measures related to likely  susceptibility, has not been done previously.",Project 1: Arsenic And Maternal And Infant Immune Function,2011,2013,"Karagas, Margaret Rita",Dartmouth College,Hanover,NH,34,1,72,5660
5R01AI055472-19,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Salmonellosis continues to be a major worldwide health concern. Essential to the pathogenicity of these bacteria is the coordinated activities of two type III protein secretion systems (TTSS), which direct the translocation into host cells of a battery of bacterial effector proteins that modulate a variety of cellular processes. Work in our laboratory supported by this Grant has focused on the study of the cell biology of the complex functional interface between Salmonella enterica and host cells, and in particular the study of the function of several Salmonella TTSS effector proteins. This research project is aimed at deepening our understanding of the cell biology of the Salmonella/host interactions, and the function of TTSS effector proteins whose role in the infection process is poorly understood. It is hoped that these studies will facilitate the development of novel immunological and pharmacological strategies to prevent diseases caused by all Salmonella enterica serovars. Furthermore, the paradigms of host-pathogen interactions established by these studies may also help the understanding of the pathogenesis of other important pathogens, which have evolved close associations with their hosts.

5R21AI095520-02,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Vibrio cholerae are aquatic bacteria that cause the severe diarrheal disease cholera when ingested by humans in contaminated water. Cholera afflicts an estimated 5 million people annually, causing over 100,000 deaths. Currently the predominant animal models for V. cholerae are infant mice and rabbits. However, these models are expensive, difficult, unpleasant, and do not reproduce true disease states, as they are not natural hosts for V. cholerae. V. cholerae naturally inhabit several aquatic niches, including associations with shellfish, insect egg masses, and plankton. Recently V. cholerae were also found to colonize the intestinal tracts of vertebrate fish. Our central hypothesis is that the zebrafish, Danio rerio, is an ideal natural animal host model for V. cholerae that will make new studies of both pathogenesis and environmental colonization possible. Zebrafish have been utilized extensively in the past 20 years as model organisms for many different biological processes, including infectious disease models. Preliminary data indicate that V. cholerae colonize the zebrafish intestine to very high levels when administered either directly into the digestive tract via gavage or when simply added to water in which zebrafish are incubated. The latter is a much more natural, representative model for colonization than any existing animal model, and we are likely to learn important new information about the colonization process by utilizing zebrafish as an animal model. In addition to colonizing the zebrafish intestine, V. cholerae that have a functional virulence regulatory system also kill zebrafish through an unknown mechanism. Therefore, zebrafish may also be a good model for studying V. cholerae disease processes. The objective of this proposal is to establish zebrafish as a functional natural animal model for V. cholerae. We will determine the sites of V. cholerae colonization of zebrafish. We will establish a timeline for colonization, such that future experiments can utilize the most relevant time points for collecting data. We will determine the infectious dose required for V. cholerae colonization of zebrafish, which is important for the design of future experiments and will illuminate the dynamics of free swimming V. cholerae and fish in the natural environment. Finally, we will determine how secreted factors from V. cholerae cause fish death. Because the major virulence regulon is required for causing zebrafish death, V. cholerae virulence genes must be induced in the presence of zebrafish. Our long term goal is to identify the signals that induce virulence during human infection such that virulence can be disrupted therapeutically. The zebrafish model presents an entirely new opportunity for identifying these signals. Establishment of zebrafish as a natural animal host model should prove extremely useful to V. cholerae researchers studying not only colonization and disease processes but also the environmental lifestyle of V. cholerae, which is very important for understanding the V. cholerae reservoirs that can produce epidemic or pandemic cholera outbreaks. Therefore establishment of this new model should have a broad impact on V. cholerae research worldwide.",Zebrafish As A Natural Host Model For Vibrio Cholerae,2011,2014,"Withey, Jeffrey H",Wayne State University,Detroit,MI,27,1,382,5098
5R01AT004789-04,National Center For Complementary and Alternative Medicine,100,"Some probiotic Lactobacillus strains demonstrated intrinsic adjuvanticity and enhanced antigen-specific immune responses to rotavirus infection and to viral and bacterial vaccines. However, the underlying mechanism of the adjuvant effect is undefined. We hypothesize that these Lactobacillus strains, rich in CpG motifs in the genome, enhance vaccine immunogenicity via immunostimulatory effects on antigen-presenting cells (APCs), which in turn, promote type 1 immune responses. We will use a well-characterized gnotobiotic (Gn) pig model of human rotavirus (HRV) infection and diarrhea to identify the mechanisms of lactobacilli's   immunostimulating effects through studies of innate and adaptive immune responses and their regulation. Our specific aims are to: 1. Determine the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of the live oral attenuated HRV (AttHRV) vaccine with Lactobacillus acidophilus and L. rhamnosus GG as adjuvants in Gn pigs and identify the mechanism of the adjuvant effects. The efficacy of lactobacilli-adjuvanted AttHRV vaccines against rotavirus diarrhea in Gn pigs challenged with a virulent HRV will be evaluated. The mechanism of immunostimulation will be identified by determining the effect of probiotics on dendritic cell (DC) maturation and function, toll-like receptor (TLR)9-expressing APC responses, Th1, Th2, and T regulatory cell and corresponding cytokine responses, and effector and memory B cell responses in intestinal and systemic sites of Gn pigs. A subset of experiments will be performed in an immunoglobulin heavy chain gene knockout (Ig-KO) and CD8+ T cell depleted Gn pig challenge model to clearly identify determinants of protective immunity against rotavirus diarrhea. 2. Evaluate the effects of lactobacilli on the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of the AttHRV vaccine in conventionalized Gn pigs. Use of conventionalized Gn pigs (mimicking formula-fed human infants colonized with commensal microflora) facilitates extrapolating our findings to humans and prevents interference and confounding factors from wild swine rotavirus contaminations. The innovative aspects of this research application include (1) use of probiotics as adjuvants rather than direct modulators of disease; and (2) use of Gn pigs, Ig-KO Gn pigs, and conventionalized Gn pigs to study the efficacy and mechanisms of probiotics' adjuvant effect on rotavirus vaccine and the determinant of protective immunity. Knowledge generated will provide a foundation for the clinical uses of probiotics as adjuvants to enhance protective efficacies of vaccines against rotavirus and other enteric virus induced diseases. Our long term goal is to promote clinical trials using the lactobacilli as rotavirus vaccine adjuvant. Considering the heavy disease burden and huge economic losses due to rotavirus infection worldwide, any improvement in vaccine efficacies will have a major impact on improving human health.      Public Health Relevance: Probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus and L. rhamnosus GG have shown intrinsic adjuvanticity and enhanced virus-specific immune responses to rotavirus natural infections and live oral vaccines; however, mechanisms for the adjuvanticity of probiotics have not been clearly defined. Our study will identify the underlying mechanisms by which probiotics exert the adjuvant effects and this knowledge will facilitate the clinical uses of probiotic adjuvants for vaccines against rotavirus and other enteric virus-induced diseases. Rotavirus gastroenteritis poses a tremendous ongoing disease burden in the US and worldwide, with costs to health care and society exceeding one billion dollars annually in the US and even more immense morbidity and mortality in developing countries; thus, any improvement in vaccine efficacies will have a major impact on improving human health.",Mechanisms Of Immune Modulation By Probiotics,2009,2014,"Yuan, Lijuan ",Virginia Polytechnic Inst and St Univ,Blacksburg,VA,55,1,-1,3946
2R01AI069986-06A1,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"The obligate intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii is a major opportunistic infection of AIDS patients. Toxoplasma also causes devastating disease to fetuses and other immunocompromised patients. While much work has focused on identifying and characterizing Toxoplasma proteins and pathways important for growth and virulence of this intracellular pathogen, less is known about which host cell pathways are rate- limiting for parasite growth. Identification of these host cell processes is important because if we can inhibit  them or the parasite processes dependent on them from functioning then we can block parasite growth and disease. Modulation of host cell transcription is a common mechanism to make the host cell's environment permissive for pathogen growth. During the previous funding period, we demonstrated that Toxoplasma activates a host cell transcription factor named Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1 (HIF-1) and requires HIF-1 for growth. HIF-1 activation is achieved by the parasite decreasing the abundance of the PHD2 protein, which is the key negative regulator of HIF-1. Decreases in PHD2 protein is achieved by the parasite signaling though the Activin Like Kinase (ALK) receptor family. Significantly, inhibition of ALK signaling severely impairs parasite growth. Together these data indicate that ALK/HIF-1 signaling is a key host cell determinant for Toxoplasma gondii growth and represent a novel mechanism by which a microbial pathogen subverts host cell signaling and transcription to establish its replicative niche. In this proposal  we will establish which ALK receptors function during Toxoplasma infection, how PHD2 protein levels are controlled in parasite- infected cells, and define the parasite processes dependent on host ALK/HIF-1 signaling. These studies are likely to provide important information regarding the interaction between Toxoplasma and its host cell.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It is essential to develop new drugs against Toxoplasma gondii, which is a parasite that causes significant disease in AIDS patients as well as cancer patients and fetuses. Because the parasite can only grow inside of a host cell, we focus on and discover host cell pathways that are essential for Toxoplasma to grow. The goal of this proposal is to understand how and why Toxoplasma regulates one of these host cell pathways, which are both key steps towards developing new drugs to treat patients suffering from Toxoplasma infections.",CONTROL OF TOXOPLASMA GONDII GROWTH BY THE HOST CELL TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR HIF1,2006,2016,"Blader, Ira J",University of Oklahoma Hlth Sciences Ctr,Oklahoma City,OK,42,1,-1,1610

While -80% outgrow  their milk allergy by the 6th birthday, 35% will develop other food allergies and about 60% develop  respiratory allergy and asthma. Milk allergy provides an ideal experiment of nature to study immunologic  mechanisms associated with oral tolerance induction to food and allergic disease. It is the most common  food allergy in American children and reflects both the transient form of food allergy that is outgrown,  similar to many other childhood food allergies [e.g. egg, soy, wheat], and the persistent, more severe form,  similar to peanut, nuts and seafood allergies. It can be definitively diagnosed with the blinded food challenge  and the responsible allergens, milk proteins, are well characterized, including their 3-dimensional structures.  Although strict milk avoidance diets have been the standard of care for milk-allergic patients, our recent  data suggest that the majority of children will tolerate heat-denatured products without deleterious effects. In  addition, preliminary studies with oral immunotherapy [OIT] have reported effective desensitization of milkallergic  patients, but whether true tolerance can be induced with this therapy remains to be demonstrated.  In Aim #1 of this project, we will delineate clinical phenotypes of milk-allergic patients based upon their  response to various forms of heat-denatured milk proteins, identify novel biomarkers differentiating the  subgroups, and elucidate immunologic changes that accompany acquisition of tolerance. Furthermore, we  hypothesize that progression toward immunological tolerance will occur more rapidly in children who are  actively ingesting milk protein, and that tolerance will be associated with distinct changes in humoral and  cellular function. In Aim #2 we will determine whether the combination of anti-lgE and milk OIT will induce  clinical tolerance compared to the desensitization seen with OIT alone, and monitor associated  immunologic changes. In conjunction with the other projects in this Center application, successful completion  of these Aims will provide new insight into the immunologic changes associated with the development of oral  tolerance to food, delineate phenotypic and immunologic differences in milk-allergic individuals, and possibly  lead to a new paradigm in the medical management and treatment of milk-allergic individuals.",Immunologic Responses To Cow's Milk Proteins In IgE-Mediated Cow's Milk Allergy,2000,2015,"Sampson, Hugh ",Icahn School of Medicine At Mount Sinai,New York,NY,37,1,-1,1473

The main reservoir for EHEC is cattle herds. EHEC colonization of cattle has been shown to require a functional locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) region, involved in intestinal adhesion, and formation of lesions on enterocytes named attaching and effacing (AE) lesions, as well as a functional SdiA transcription factor. SdiA is a quorum sensing transcription factor that requires its autoinducer, an acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) for proper folding and function. EHEC harbors SdiA, but does not produce an AHL autoinducer, consequently having to sense AHLs produced by other species of bacteria in the environment. These observations, combined with reports showing that AHLs are prominent within cattle rumen, suggest an important role for SdiA- AHL mediated regulation of EHEC genes necessary for colonization of the bovine gastrointestinal (GI) tract. We demonstrated that both synthetic AHLs, as well as AHLs extracted from cattle rumen repress expression of the LEE genes. However, the role of diet in modulating AHL levels within the rumen, and their correlation with EHEC shedding remain poorly understood. Furthermore, the mechanisms by which SdiA regulates transcription are still unknown. Finally, the distribution of an sdiA mutant within the intestinal tract of cattle, as well as a definitive reason underlying its attenuation remains to be established. Accordingly the Specific Aims of this study are: Specific Aim 1: To assess the presence of AHLs in rumen samples from cattle, as well as their correlation with diet and EHEC shedding. Specific Aim 2: Determine the molecular mechanisms of SdiA-dependent gene regulation.

5R01AI082423-04,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Toxoplasma gondii is a widespread protozoan parasite of wild, domestic, and companion animals that also commonly infects humans. Severe infections are normally only found in immunocompromised patients, including HIV infection, cancer chemotherapy, organ transplant, or infants infected in utero. Additionally, emerging studies indicate that severe ocular toxoplasmosis can also occur in healthy adults, and that chronic infection is an underlying risk factor for some forms of psychiatric disease. Toxoplasma isolates differ dramatically in their virulence in animal models and also in human infections. Recent findings reveal that the major virulence determinants of this parasite are secretory proteins derived from the rhoptries (ROPs), which are injected to the host cell at the time of invasion. Many ROPs contain a conserved serine / threonine kinase domain and are predicted to function as kinases, potentially altering host signaling pathways by phosphorylation of specific targets. In preliminary studies, we have developed a systematic gene disruption strategy to target all of the known active ROP kinases in the genome. Disruption of ROP kinases will be used to define their roles during growth in vitro vs. in vivo in the mouse model. Separately, we have designed a single-step insertional strategy to generate conditional expression alleles of essential ROP kinases. Knockdown of individual ROPs will be used to explore the functional pathways controlled by these kinases. We will also employ biochemical assays and mass spectrometry to identify the substrate specificity of ROP kinases, there by providing specific substrates for development of inhibitor assays. Expression of recombinant proteins will be used to develop in vitro activity assays and to screen focused kinase inhibitor libraries to indentify potent inhibitors.

Currently, the only treatment for peanut allergy is a  peanut-free diet and ready access to self-injectable epinephrine. However, accidental ingestions are  common, with up to 50% of food-allergic patients having an allergic reaction over a two-year period. Allergic  reactions to peanut can be severe and life threatening, with peanut and/or tree nut allergies accounting for  the vast majority of fatal food-induced anaphylaxis. Given these facts, the development of effective therapy  for peanut allergy is critical. Over the past several years we have made substantial progress in our  understanding of peanut allergy and potential treatment strategies for peanut and other food allergies.  Recent studies have shown the potential of oral immunotherapy for the treatment of milk, egg and peanut  allergies, but this therapy primarily appears to induce desensitization, and adverse reacfions are common,  unpredictable and somefimes severe. Consequently, more effective therapies are needed.  The goal ofthis applicafion is to expand upon these preliminary studies to determine which treatment  modality is likely to be most effective and potentially applicable to the general population of peanut allergic  patients, and to understand the immunologic mechanisms associated with the development of  desensitization and tolerance induced by these immunotherapeutic modalifies.

5R01AI044170-15,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi causes a severe systemic infection in humans, termed typhoid fever, which is responsible for an estimated 600,000 deaths annually. The pathogenesis of typhoid fever is only poorly understood due to the lack of suitable animal models. S. enterica serotype Typhimurium infection of mice is commonly used as a model to study the pathogenesis of S. Typhi infections in humans. A limitation of this approach is that S. Typhimurium does not cause typhoid fever in humans, but rather causes a localized gastroenteritis resulting in diarrhea. The observation that humans infected with S. Typhi or S. Typhimurium develop different disease syndromes (i.e. typhoid fever vs. gastroenteritis) illustrates that some virulence mechanisms important for the pathogenesis of typhoid fever are only present in S. Typhi. The rationale for the proposed research is that a complete understanding of the pathogenesis of typhoid fever will require studies that focus on eliciting S. Typhi-specific virulence mechanisms. Our long-range goal is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which Salmonella serotypes manipulate host responses during infection. The objectives of this application are to study the mechanism by which the viaB locus, a S. Typhi- specific DNA region, contributes to host pathogen interaction. Our central hypothesis is that TviA, a regulatory protein encoded by the viaB locus, coordinates changes in bacterial gene expression that enable S. Typhi to evade innate immunity, thereby contributing to the development of host responses that distinguish typhoid fever from gastroenteritis. We will test different aspects of our hypothesis and accomplish the objectives of this application by pursuing the following two specific aims: 1. Investigate the mechanisms by which TviA manipulates the interaction of S. Typhi with the innate immune system. 2. Determine the role of the viaB locus in generating disease manifestations that distinguish typhoid fever from infections with non-typhoidal Salmonella serotypes. The proposed studies will take an innovative approach that links clinical observations to molecular virulence mechanisms. By establishing these connections, our studies are expected to demonstrate that TviA- mediated innate immune evasion is a S. Typhi-specific virulence mechanism that can explain several disease manifestations that distinguish typhoid fever from gastroenteritis. This outcome is significant because it will establish a new paradigm in Salmonella pathogenesis, which is expected to have a measurable impact on the field of bacterial pathogenesis.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Typhoid fever is a major human disease syndrome caused by the strictly human adapted Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi.

5R01CA129558-02,National Cancer Institute,99,"Early life arsenic exposure and adult mortality in Region II, Chile Millions of people in the US and worldwide are exposed to high concentrations of arsenic in their drinking water, and the estimated risks of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and other adverse outcomes associated with these exposures is very high. From 1958 to 1970, over 125,000 people in the city of Antofagasta in Region II of Chile experienced a sudden and unusual period of high drinking water arsenic concentrations. This exposure period was highly distinct, with low exposure before the highly contaminated drinking water sources were first used in 1958, and a sudden drop in water arsenic concentrations (from around 870 5g/L to eventually 10 5g/L) when an arsenic removal plant was installed in 1971. As far as we know, a scenario like this, in such a large and uniformly exposed population, has never been reported for any environmental contaminant. Our investigation of this unique population has already been highly productive. For example, we identified major increases in mortality in Antofagasta among people who were young children or in utero during the high exposure period. These increases were found for bladder cancer (standardized mortality ratio [SMR]=21.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 11.6 to 35.7), laryngeal cancer (SMR=10.5; 95% CI, 3.4 to 24.6), lung cancer (SMR=6.8; 95% CI, 5.4 to 8.4), kidney cancer (SMR=3.4; 95% CI, 1.7 to 6.2) and liver cancer (SMR=3.1; 95% CI, 1.8 to 4.9). Non-cancer deaths were increased from bronchiectasis (SMR=25.1; 95% CI, 13.4 to 42.9), acute myocardial infarction (SMR=2.4; 95% CI, 1.9 to 3.0) and chronic renal disease (SMR=2.3; 95% CI, 1.6 to 3.3). Increases were greatest for those born during the high exposure period (with likely in utero exposure) for bladder cancer (SMR=55.9; 95%CI, 25.5 to 106) and bronchiectasis (SMR=46.2; 95%CI, 21.1 to 87.7). This was the first human study to link early life exposure to a common drinking water contaminant to high risks of cancer and non-cancer outcomes in adults. Because of the timing of the high exposure period (1958-1970), our previous studies could only assess the long-term effects of early life exposure in relatively young adults (i.e., those in their 30s and 40s). In this proposal, we seek to extend our investigation to cover ten additional years of mortality data, from 2001-2010. This will allow us to evaluate whether the effects of early life exposure we identified in young adults continue into older age groups. This is important because the baseline risks for most chronic diseases are higher in these older age groups. Because of these higher baseline risks, increases in relative risk due to arsenic in these older groups would cause larger numbers of arsenic-related deaths, and therefore larger increases in the overall burden of disease in exposed populations. Currently, many people in the US use private wells with high concentrations of arsenic, including some as high or higher than they were in Antofagasta. Region II of Chile provides the best population in the world to assess the effects of early life arsenic exposure. The reasons include the fact that this is the driest inhabited place on earth, with only one water source for each town and city and accurate records of arsenic concentrations for the last 50 years or more. The limited number of water sources and availability of good records means that arsenic exposure from the distant past can be assessed with greater accuracy than can be done anywhere else in the world. This accurate data on exposure substantially reduces the exposure assessment problems (i.e., ecologic fallacy) commonly seen in many ecologic studies. Another advantage is that the number of people who were highly exposed in Antofagasta is more than ten times greater than in any other published arsenic study in the world. In this situation, the ecologic study design is ideal, since it allows us to study a variety of different causes of death, in a very large exposed population, with good data on past exposure, good statistical power, and a low probability of major confounding. This mortality study is probably the only opportunity available to see if the already identified major effects of early life exposure to arsenic on multiple causes of death in young adults continues into older age groups. This would have several important public health implications. For example, health care providers in the US and worldwide would need to be more alert to arsenic health effects and exposure, especially in pregnant women, infants, and young children, and should ask all patients from rural areas if they have private wells, and if they have been tested for arsenic. In addition, the current drinking water standard of 10 5g/L might need further examination, since the risk estimates on which this standard is based did not consider the risks associated with early life exposure.","Early-Life Arsenic Exposure And Adult Mortality In Region II, Chile",2011,2014,"Smith, Allan H",University of California Berkeley,Berkeley,CA,6,1,-1,1863
5R01AI089894-04,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"The long-term objective of this work is to identify molecular targets on the surface of enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) that could be used in a vaccine. These organisms are globally the most common bacterial cause of serious diarrheal illness, perennially the most main infection associated with diarrhea in travelers, and an emerging cause of diarrheal illness in the US. Despite the relevance of these organisms to global human health, there is presently no broadly protective ETEC vaccine available.  These studies will use newly available state-of the-art technology platforms designed specifically for this purpose. These will include both DNA (gene) and protein microarrays made available by the NIAID-sponsored Pathogen Functional Genomic Resource Center. Both the gene and protein microarrays encompass known or potential virulence factors from multiple ETEC strains making them extraordinarily useful tools for vaccine discovery. The aims of this project are: Aim 1. Indentify: (a). genes conserved among ETEC strains isolated from cases of severe cholera-like diarrheal illness, (b). virulence factors that are altered in response to infection. Both of sets of studies will use ETEC-specific DNA microarrays made available by the PFGRC. Aim 2. Indentify proteins that are recognized by antibodies following experimental infections in mice or natural infections in humans. These studies will use immuno-proteomic techniques including mass spectrometry and protein microarrays produced by the PFGRC. Aim 3. Finally, this project will test the protective efficacy of proteins identified as being both highly conserved (aim 1) and recognized during infection (aim 2) in a recently developed adult mouse model of ETEC infection. Following purification of the proteins, mice will be immunized and challenged with ETEC to test the ability of the candidate vaccine molecules to prevent infection.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) are responsible for millions of infections and hundreds of thousands of deaths due to diarrhea annually. While these infections predominate in developing countries, and are perennially the major cause of traveler's diarrhea, they are also responsible for numerous recent large-scale outbreaks in the United States. The major long-term goal of this research is to prevent these infections by development of an ETEC vaccine.",Novel Antigen Identification For An Enterotoxigenic E.

Listeria monocytogenes is a highly amenable model intracellular pathogen that induces robust and long-lived  cell mediated immunity. The goal of the previous proposal was to identify L. monocytogenes determinants  that activate a host cytosolic surveillance pathway (CSP) of innate immunity that leads to the expression of  IFNB and co-regulated genes. We hypothesize that this pathway contributes significantly to the potent and  long-lived cell-mediated immunity induced by L. monocytogenes. Using a genetic screen and subsequent  biochemistry, we identified c-di-AMP as the listerial ligand that is secreted through a multidrug efflux pump  and activates the CSP. Thus, c-di-AMP is a newly discovered PAMP. C-di-AMP is also a novel and  conserved small bacterial signaling molecule that appears essential for bacterial growth. We have identified  the di-adenylate cyclase (DacA) and c-di-AMP phosphodiesterase (Pde). In Aim 1, we propose to further  characterize the molecular determinants that lead to expression of c-di-AMP and generate a panel of well-characterized  strains that express either enhanced or diminished levels of c-di-AMP. We will also address  the following questions: What are the bacterial components that regulate c-di-AMP production? Does c-di-  AMP act from the inside and/or the outside of bacteria? What is the physiologic role of c-di-AMP? In Aim 2,  we will use the strains constructed above to determine the role of c-di-AMP during infection of macrophages  and dendritic cells in vitro. We will also evaluate the effects of purified c-di-AMP on dendritic cell activation.  In collaboration with the Vance Lab (Project 3), we will use ENU mutagenesis to identify novel host factors  that control the CSP. In preliminary data, we identified Sting (Stimulator of interferon genes) as a critical  host component necessary for response to L. monocytogenes, M. tuberculosis, and c-di-AMP. In the final  Aim, we will test the hypothesis that c-di-AMP production is essential for the full expression of L.  monocytogenes pathogenesis, and importantly, contributes to the induction of cell-mediated immunity. We  will examine the role of c-di-AMP as an adjuvant.",The Role Of Listeria Cyclic-Di-AMP During Infection And Immunity,,,"Portnoy, Daniel A",University of California Berkeley,Berkeley,CA,6,1,-1,1251

It has high potential to be a widely protective vaccine against a  diverse array of pathogens, but specific glycoforms, notably ones lacking acetate substituents on the amino  groups of the glucosamine monosaccharide are needed to produce optimal immunity. Additionally, active  and passive vaccination strategies targeting PNAG have moved into early clinical development, but the utility  of this antigen as a single component vaccine is likely to be suboptimal, Furthermore, pathogen-derived  PNAG antigen may be suboptimal for synthesizing vaccines that elicit the most effective protective antibody  response. Finally, producing conjugate vaccines using an array of different carrier proteins can be time consuming  and expensive. To address these issues, synthetic oligoglucosamine glycoforms will be produced  that can be easily stored and readily conjugated to a variety of recombinant carrier proteins derived from targeted  pathogens. These vaccines will be evaluated for engendering protection against methicillin-resistant S.  aureus (MRSA), enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) O157 and similar Shiga toxin (STX)-prpducing strains,  and Y. pestis. Moreover, these PNAG-based vaccines will also be evaluated for the ability to prevent mucpsal  colonization as well as pneumonia, two critical interventions that have not yet been tested. PNAG-based  conjugate vaccines will be paired with recombinant proteins specific to each of the pathogens to determine if  additive, synergistic or possibly even inhibitory immune effects can be engendered by multicomponent preparations.  Conjugate vaccines for MRSA will contain synthetic PNAG oligosaccharides plus capsular polysaccharide  types 5 (CP5) and 8 (CP8). Carrier protein antigens will include those that contribute to protective  immunity, such as alpha-hemolysin toxoid (Hla) or clumping factor B (ClfB). Vaccines for EHEC will include  conjugates of synthetic PNAG oligosaccharides and STX. Synthetic PNAG oligoglucosamines conjugated to  LcrV, F1 capsule or a fusion protein of these will be used to target Y. pestis.

5U19AI082655-04,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Shigella is a global infection that is notorious for disseminating rapidly in certain settings. One serotype,  Shigella dysenteriae type 1 (S. dysenteriae 1), can cause devastating pandemics with high case fatality rates  and thus it has been classified as a Category B priority pathogen with high potential to be used as a  biological weapon. There is no available vaccine for Shigella. The development of effective Shigella vaccines  has been hampered by a considerable lack of information of the specific determinants of protective immunity  to Shigella infection. Because of the limitations imposed by the risks associated with performing challenge  studies with wild type S. dysenteriae 1 in clinical trials to advance vaccine development, a non-human  primate model is urgently needed. We have already established a challenge model with wild-type S.  dysenteriae 1 strain 1617 which, to date, exhibited an attack rate of 100% (6 of 6 cynomolgus macaques  challenged with 10e11 cfu intragastrically). Furthermore, we have advanced our understanding of the  immune responses elicited following challenge. In this application we propose to continue these studies by  addressing the following Specific Aims: (1) evaluate the hypothesis that intragastric immunization with novel  attenuated S. dysenteriae 1 mutant strains elicits protection from intragastric challenge with wild type S.  dysenteriae 1; (2) evaluate the hypotheses that a defined set of immune responses observed in circulation in  cynomolgus immunized with attenuated strains of S. dysenteriae 1 and/or challenged with wild type S.  dysenteriae 1 correlate with protection and are representative of those present at effector sites (i.e., mucosal  tissues) and secondary lymphoid organs. These translational studies are central to further our  understanding of the immunological mechanisms that mediate protection to S. dysenteriae 1 and longevity of  the responses to vaccination in humans, (3) To evaluate the effects of immunization of monkeys with  attenuated S. dysenteriae 1 strains on the colonic microbiota in stools of monkeys and the impact of the  existing microbiota on the observed immune responses and protection from challenge. Finally, we will take  advantage of an upcoming trial with the attenuated S. dysenteriae 1 strain CVD 1256 to evaluate the  hypothesis that the immune responses observed systemically and locally in humans are similar to those that  correlate with protection in cynomolgus macaques (Aims 1 and 2).

During the initial granting period we established uniform reproducible technology across 5 sites allowing for the study of sensitization and T-cell activation, and assessment of the development of tolerance. There were several findings that caused us to question some of the previous dogma including the fact that a large cohort of milk and egg allergic children were already sensitized to peanut at an early age, that the GATA-3 transcription factor may play less of a role in allergic sensitization in humans than previously thought and that there was a high likelihood of a non- T cell origin for IL-4 (and consequent IgE) in these patients. The current proposal seeks to continue the  current studies focused on the role of T cells vs. APCs in allergic sensitization and tolerance, as well as expand studies on the role of basophils in this process. In addition, we now plan to specifically explore the expression and regulation of GATA-3 in T and non-T cells, initiate studies attempting to correlate the expression of food allergy as either atopic, i.e. atopic dermatitis, asthma or allergic rhinitis, vs eosinophilic esophagitis using the immunologic parameters previously described, and finally to use a microarray  approach to define novel pathways and markers of atopic disease, disease resolution and tolerance and the distinct expression of disease phenotypes (AD vs EE).

5R01AI079182-04,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Toxoplasma gondii is the causative agent of toxoplasmosis. For most of the estimated 60 million US citizens that have been exposed to the Toxoplasma parasite, most will have very few symptoms because a healthy person's immune system usually keeps the parasite from causing illness. However, pregnant women and individuals who have compromised immune systems are vulnerable to the full spectrum of serious health problems caused by the disease including blindness, encephalitis, mental retardation, and death. Treatment of toxoplasmosis with available therapeutics is not ideal and does not eradicate the parasite from the patient and therefore re-infections may occur. Work Accomplished: We have discovered and seek to improve an entirely new type of drug for prevention and treatment of toxoplasmosis. With IC50 values in the low nanomolar and picomolar range our most active compounds, so-called, ELQs, are far more potent (in vitro) than any drug in clinical use today for treating toxoplasmosis. If these drugs prove to be safe and effective enough to go into actual use, the potential benefit is nothing less than saving lives and sparing many individuals from long-term neurological damage, as well as damage to other organs such as the eyes, liver and spleen, heart and lung. Work Proposed: Specific objectives to be pursued as part of the project plan include: (1) to optimize the chemical structure of the ELQ pharmacophore by continued synthesis and design of analogs, (2) to screen new derivatives for selective potency against T. gondii in vitro and in vivo and in rational combination with standard therapeutics, (3) to monitor the metabolic stability of lead candidate ELQs in vitro in microsomal preparations and to determine pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic parameters in vivo in mice, and (4) to investigate the mechanism underlying the selective and potent antitoxoplasmial effects of ELQs. Taken together, we're excited by the possibilities and the potential for new drug development for treatment of toxoplasmosis in humans. Relevance to NIAID's mission: A primary mission of the NIAID is to conduct and support research that helps to provide protection against emerging and chronic infectious diseases that represent a threat to public health. Bioterrorism represents a new threat to public health and to meet the challenges posed by biodefense, NIAID supports research on countermeasures to infectious agents (including Toxoplasma gondii) that may be weaponized for bioterrorism. The development of therapies to prevent or treat infectious diseases, including diseases that are caused by potential agents of bioterror, is fundamental to the ever-expanding mission served by NIAID. Thus, for a multiplicity of reasons including public health, protection of the unborn child from birth defects, as well as biodefense, the proposed project is entirely relevant to NIAID's mission.

However, the utility of this class of antibiotics in Enterobacteriaceae is compromised by the rapid spread of new (-lactamase resistance mechanisms, enzymes produced by bacteria that hydrolytically inactivate (-lactam antibiotics. In this application we propose to develop a new, first-in-class, highly potent and broad spectrum (-lactamase inhibitor, PZ-7475. This inhibitor rescues the activity of (-lactam antibiotics against strains of Enterobacteriaceae (including Salmonella and Shigella spp.) that express Ambler class A, C and D (- lactamase enzymes. In addition to its excellent safety and physiochemical properties, PZ-7475 has a long plasma half life, uniquely positioning it to be used in combination with ceftriaxone, the once-a-day, workhorse parenteral (-lactam for important Category B bacterial food and water-borne pathogens. During the course of the requested 3-year Grant funding we intend to: (a) advance PZ-7475 in combination with ceftriaxone through the first stages of Preclinical development, particularly concentrating on aspects critical to Category B; (b) identify and advance back-up compounds to PZ-7475 as a contingency; and (c) develop an orally bioavailable beta-lactamase inhibitor through synthesis and testing of analogues of PZ-7475 and ester prodrugs thereof.

It is a staggering problem when one considers the fact that about 40% of the genes in of one of the best-understood organisms, Escherichia coli, are not experimentally defined. The organism colonizes the human intestine shortly after birth and is, along with its close relatives such as Salmonella, Shigella and Yersinia, a pathogen that is a significant source of human disease. Glutathione (GSH) is the predominant redox active thiol in most aerobic organisms where it plays a fundamental role in metabolic, catabolic and redox chemistry. GSH transferases are enzymes that participate in this chemistry by adding GSH to electrophilic acceptors. The E. coli genome harbors genes encoding nine glutathione (GSH) transferase homologues. Amazingly, only one gene has a reasonably well-defined function and it does NOT encode a GSH transferase but rather stringent starvation protein A, SspA, a transcription factor. Under aerobic conditions, GSH is the predominate thiol in E. coli. However it is largely converted to glutathionylspermidine (GspSH) under anaerobic conditions by glutathionylspermidine synthetase/amidase (GSS). The broad, long-term objectives of this project are to understand the GSH/GspSH homeostasis in E. coli and the biological activities and roles of chromosomally encoded GSH transferase homologues in E. coli. Ten interrelated proteins are the subject of this investigation. They include the eight canonical GSH transferase homologues, YliJ, YncG, Gst, YfcF, YfcG, YghU, SspA, and YibF as well as GSS, and the membrane-bound GSH transferase, YecN. The research plan includes three specific aims. The first aim is to understand the mechanism and regulation of GSH/GspSH homeostasis in E. coli. The second aim is to define the biological functions of the eight canonical GSH transferase homologues in E. coli. The third aim is to determine the biological role of the single membrane-bound GSH transferase homologue. These aims will be achieved by a multidisciplinary approach that includes: (i) analysis of genome context; (ii) phenotypic responses to gene knockouts; (iii) response of gene expression to growth conditions and stress; (iv) a search for protein partners; (v) determination of X-ray crystal structures of the proteins; (vi) functional and kinetic characterizations of the proteins.

Aim 1 is designed to develop epigenetic targets as biomarkers of arsenical exposure. Preliminary epigenome-wide scanning studies of urine sediments from individuals with known exposure levels in their  drinking water have identified candidate epigenetic biomarkers are correlated with arsenical exposure level. The utility of these candidate biomarkers will be evaluated using high sensitivity, high resolution technologies in a new cohort population. Aim 2 will determine if arsenicals produce common perturbations to the epigenomic landscape in their distinct epithelial targets. Experimental strategies of arsenical exposure that caused malignant transformation of urothelial cells will be expanded to lung epithelial model systems. Results from these experiments will help determine if there are seminal epigenetic changes that are common to epithelial malignant transformation in general, as well as the epigenetic changes that display tissue-origin specificity. Aim 3 will provide a detailed investigation of the phenotypic consequences of epigenetic gene inactivation of an arsenical target gene, G0S2, which is closely linked to the malignant transformation of urothelial cells.

This translational research proposal tests  the hypothesis that appropriately engineered attenuated strains of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium  and Enteritidis, with attenuating mutations in guaBA (encoding guanine nucleotide biosynthesis enzymes)  and either dpX (encoding ATPase) or dpP (encoding a protease), can play an important role in vaccinating  against these NTS serovars by: 1) allowing safer, high yield preparation of purified O polysaccharide (OPS)  and flagella protein for making conjugate vaccines (dpP and c/pX mutants hyper-express flagella), and 2) by  their use in a heterologous mucosal prime/parenteral boost immunization strategy in which mice given the  attenuated strains of S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis orally are subsequently boosted parenterally with  conjugate vaccines consisting of Salmonella Group B and D OPS covalently linked to Phase 1 flagella  protein of Typhimurium or Enteritidis, respectively. We hypothesize that this strategy will markedly broaden  the immune responses elicited and enhance protection (tested in oral challenge studies in mice) over what  can be achieved with either oral vaccines or conjugates alone. We expect SlgA antibodies and cellmediated  immunity (CMI) stimulated by the live vaccine to synergize with the serum IgG anti-OPS  bactericidal antibodies and anti-flagella antibodies stimulated by the parenteral conjugate vaccines.  Two S.

Since Typhimurium and Enteritidis are the most common NTS serovars associated with invasive and  severe gastrointestinal NTS clinical disease in the USA (and globally), this research can pave the way for  development of a rational, highly effective, broad spectrum vaccine against NTS.

The symptoms of infection vary considerably, ranging from subclinical to severe, although the factors that control these disparate outcomes are poorly understood. One component that likely contributes to disease severity is the genetic makeup of the parasite. However, little is known about the specific parasite genes that are responsible for influencing disease severity. Our previous studies have shown that T. gondii has a highly unusual genetic makeup consisting of three clonal lineages that are wide spread in North America and Europe. These three strain types differ substantially in the immune responses they evoke and the severity of infections that they cause. The proposed studies will investigate the molecular basis of acute virulence in Toxoplasma gondii using forward and reverse genetics to identify genes important for pathogenesis. We will explore the role of secretory kinases, recently implicated as major virulence determinants of T. gondii, and characterize their cellular and biochemical mechanisms of action. Additional genetic crosses between different parasite genotypes will be undertaken to map genes that regulate differences in pathogenesis, including genes that control tissue migration, induction of immune responses, and acute virulence. Finally, we will identify genes that contribute to pathogenesis of newly described T. gondii lineages from other geographic regions.

1R21AI099497-01,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Transcription activation is typically carried out by soluble proteins engaging basal elements of the transcription apparatus - including promoter DNA and RNA polymerase - in the bacterial cytoplasm. In the Gram negative pathogen Vibrio cholerae, virulence gene expression is under control of an unusual set of membrane proteins. We hypothesize that a membrane complex including two activators, ToxR and TcpP, binds to the toxT promoter, recruits RNA polymerase, and activates toxT gene expression leading to activation of ToxT-controlled virulence genes. The mechanism by which membrane proteins can access DNA in the cell and recruit RNA polymerase has not been uncovered with standard genetic and biochemical approaches. Single-molecule imaging methods with nanometer-scale resolution now make it possible to investigate this mechanism in living cells, and these techniques will be applied to the ToxR/TcpP system to test specific hypotheses.

5R01AI042334-13,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Toxoplasma remains an important cause of congenital infection and a common opportunistic infection in patients with primary and acquired defects in T cell function. This parasite can also cause significant disease in immune competent individuals and has been classified as a category B agent of bioterrorism. Consequently, there has been a long standing interest in defining the immune mechanisms that control this organism. Studies using mouse and human cells have led to a model in which the innate immune system directs the development of protective T cells, characterized by the production of IFN-? which limits parasite replication. However, while T cells are required for the long-term control of T. gondii this same response can contribute to immune-pathology. Consequently, there are numerous regulatory networks that limit the pathological response and early studies identified IL-10 as a key cytokine to prevent immune hyper-reactivity. More recently, this laboratory identified a similar role for the heterodimeric cytokine IL-27 in limiting T cell responses during toxoplasmosis and defined a role for IL-27 in inhibiting multiple T helper cell responses during other parasitic infections. Subsequently we also showed that IL-27 induced the production of IL-10. This latter finding has led to competing models for how T cell sources of IL-10 are regulated. In addition, there remains a poor understanding of the cellular sources of IL-27, the stimuli that control its production during infection and whether it is a negative regulator of innate immunity to T. gondii. Moreover, our preliminary data indicate that different components of IL-27 have unique biological functions and this has raised questions about the role of the cytokine sub-units in promoting protective anti-parasite responses versus limiting infection-induced pathology. Based on these findings, complimentary SA have been developed with the overall goal of understanding the role o IL-27 in innate and adaptive responses to T. gondii. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Toxoplasma is a common opportunistic infection in patients with defects in T cell function and can cause significant disease in immune competent individuals. Under certain circumstances the immune response to this microbe can be extremely violent and cause severe tissue damage. The overall goal of this proposal is to understand how the molecule IL-27 prevents the immune system from over reacting to this infection.",Regulation Of The Early Immune Response To Toxoplasma Gondii,1997,2014,"Hunter, Christopher A",University of Pennsylvania,Philadelphia,PA,45,1,210,1557
5U54AI057158-09,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"This application will bring together the expertise of different investigators and incooperate state of the art  platform technologies with the goal to optimize monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to Staphylococcal enterotoxin B  (SEE) for human use. Beyond the immediate benefit of yielding a novel therapeutic reagent, this work will  investigate several hypotheses that pertain to toxin-neutralization and clearance. The underlying working  hypothesis of our proposal is that high affinity anti-SEB mAbs are best suited for therapeutic use because  low amounts of mAb will be sufficient to successfully compete with already bound SEB. We will investigate if  human mAbs differ and are superior in their ability to neutralize toxin, In addition we propose that targeted  engineering of the C-terminal with effects on FcR binding will change toxin clearance in vivo. In the past  funding period 11 mAbs to SEB have been subcloned, characterized and tested in murine animal model for  SEB induced shock. A highly sensitive capture ELISA was developed that will allow us in proposed  experiments to measure SEB toxin in serum of intoxicated mice. In addition the prevalance of SEB producing  S. aureus strains has been established and identified important sequence variabilities in different S. aureus  strains which will be taken into consideration. Three lgG1 candidate mAbs have been selected for targeted  Ab engineering. They recognize epitopes in the C-terminal part of the protein, which is also the predominant  epitope recognized by human B-cells. Protection was documented in animal models and human T-cell  stimulation assays. In addition heavy and light chain variable regions of the mAbs were cloned. In Aim one  we propose to optimize these mAbs by affinity maturation in collaboration with Dr. Scharff. In Aim 2 we  propose to generate new human SEB apecific mAbs one involving a genetically modified mouse that  expresses the human variable region and the other one we will use Drs. Ahmed/Wilson's technique to  directly clone the variable region from patients with primary S. aureus infection. Finally in aim 3 we will  engineer the FC binding portion of the mAbs in collaboration with Dr. Ravetch and test the intriguing  hypothesis that combination of mAbs enhances neutralization and clearance.",Optimization Of MAbs To Staphylococcal Enterotoxin B For Treatment,,,"Fries, Bettina ",Columbia University Health Sciences,New York,NY,37,1,-1,-1
5K08DK090281-02,National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,24,"Children with aganglionic colon present with a constellation of symptoms (e.g., severe constipation, diarrhea, intestinal inflammation) that predispose to sepsis, and can be life-threatening. Surgical correction eradicates these symptoms in most cases. But in up to 30% of cases, surgery fails to cure the disorder, and thereafter, children suffer from chronic enterocolitis that can lead to bacteremia, outright sepsis, and even death. Almost nothing is known about the underlying mechanisms of this postoperative enterocolitis. As a means to pursue mechanistic studies, we created an animal model of postoperative enterocolitis associated with aganglionosis using the Endothelin Receptor B-null mouse with colonic aganglionosis. We developed a novel microsurgical procedure that is essentially identical to the operation performed clinically, and essentially cures aganglionic megacolon in Ednrb-/- mice, just as it does in human patients. We found that a significant proportion of Ednrb- /- mice develop postoperative enterocolitis despite satisfactory surgical outcome, similar to what occurs clinically in human patients. In the course of our studies, we serendipitously discovered a spectrum of striking immune abnormalities in Ednrb-/- mice. These abnormalities occur at or shortly after birth, appear to worsen with age, and include reduced spleen size, reduced absolute numbers of lymphocytes in the spleen, marked reduction in marginal zone B cells and B cell/T cell ratio in the spleen, thymic involution, and bone marrow abnormalities. Upon examination of mice with a genetic lack of entdothelin-3 (ET3; the preferred ligand for the Ednrb receptor), we found very similar immune abnormalities. Our preliminary studies thus far are consistent with the interpretation that ET3 signaling through Ednrb is required for normal development of the immune system, and/or for normal function of the immune system in the adult animal. We therefore propose that 1) ET3/Ednrb signaling is essential for normal development of the immune system; 2) when disrupted, two distinct phenotypic features emerge: colonic aganglionosis, with a marked propensity to develop enterocolities even after successful surgical correction, and an immune system that displays marked structural and functional abnormalities. We suspect that these two phenotypic features are indeed related to one another, and our ultimate goal is to understand and describe in molecular and cellular terms the precise basis of the interrelationships. This K08 application proposes an a detailed, comprehensive training plan that will allow the applicant to pursue immunologic studies related to disrupted ET3/Ednrb signaling. An outstanding team of Mentors will directly oversee the research training and the all aspects of the investigation. The ultimate goal is for the applicant to leverage the data obtained during this proposed investigation into a successful R01 application.

5R01AI075192-05,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Amalgamating the tools of molecular biology, biochemistry, cell biology, genetics, structural biology, and pharmacology, this proposal offers an interdisciplinary dissection of the purine salvage pathway of Cryptosporidium parvum, a protozoan parasite that is an opportunistic pathogen of people with AIDS and an NIAID Biodefense Research Category B Priority Pathogen. C. parvum is the etiologic agent of cryptosporidiosis, a debilitating and potentially fatal disease for which no consistently effective chemotherapies exist, especially for immunocompromised individuals. Thus, more efficacious drugs, particularly those that target unique features in C. parvum, are urgently needed. Among the more striking metabolic discrepancies between C. parvum and its human host are the pathways for purine acquisition. C. parvum, unlike mammals, cannot synthesize purines de novo and is dependent upon a unique purine salvage mechanism to fulfill its nutritional needs. Inhibition of purine salvage, therefore, presents a selective therapeutic paradigm for treating C. parvum infections. In this proposal, we will investigate three imperative components of purine salvage; adenosine kinase (CpAK), adenylate deaminase (CpAMPDA), and guanylate synthetase (CpGMPS). There are two Specific Aims. Multi-component Specific Aim I delineates a detailed biochemical, biological, and functional characterization of all three enzymes and a structural analysis of CpAK. We will clone all three genes and functionally evaluate their gene products through biochemical studies of their encoded products and by rescue or complementation of genetic lesions in other organisms. The expression patterns of the CpAK, CpAMPDA, and CpGMPS genes and the levels and location of the three proteins in intact C. parvum parasites will be ascertained throughout biologically accessible life cycle stages. Finally, structure-function studies based upon a molecular model of CpAK will test the roles of key residues on CpAK that are projected to be involved in the catalytic mechanism, and crystallographic studies on CpAK will be initiated with the ultimate intention of determining its three-dimensional structure. The second Specific Aim has two parts. First, we will perform a structure-activity relationship analysis of CpAK against a battery of available nucleoside analogs. Second, we will optimize and implement a high throughput screen of a structurally diverse chemical repository using an E. coli-based assay with the purpose of discovering novel inhibitors of CpAK that could be potentially used for treating the parasitic disease. The hits from the screen will be further evaluated using target-based and cell-based assays and eventually in a mouse model that mimics the human disease. Overall, the proposed investigations constitute a logical step in the validation of these enzymes as potential therapeutic targets and in the implementation of a rational strategy of drug discovery for treatment of cryptosporidiosis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The overall purpose of this proposal is to investigate components of the purine salvage pathway of Cryptosporidium parvum, a waterborne parasite that causes a devastating opportunistic infection in people with AIDS and is also a Category B priority pathogen of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease because the organism can be maliciously manipulated as a biological weapon. There is currently no vaccine and no consistently effective chemotherapy, so there is an urgent need for new drugs and new drug targets. Because purine salvage is essential for Cryptosporidium parvum and not for humans, our studies address the vital issue of validating new targets and discovering potentially novel drugs.",Purine Salvage Pathway Of Cryptosporidium Parvum,2008,2013,"Ullman, Buddy ",Oregon Health & Science University,Portland,OR,43,1,132,1627
5U01AI077883-05,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"There is a need for systems to rapidly identify markers of protective immunity against a number of category A, B and C agents of high public and international health importance. In addition, there is a need for the development of platforms to rapidly evaluate the breadth and duration of immune responses following vaccination against such pathogens, correlating responses to those found to be protective. Vibrio cholerae is a category B agent, and the cause of cholera, a secretary diarrhea that results in significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. The mediators of protective immunity against cholera are poorly understood, and although a number of cholera vaccines have been developed, each has significant limitations. We propose to use previously created reagents (already-collected clinical specimens and already-produced V. cholerae NAPPA protein microarrays) to perform high throughput proteomics-based screening to identify markers of protective immunity against cholera, and to compare immune responses correlating with protection with those induced following vaccination. To do this, we propose a cooperative research partnership between researchers at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), Harvard Institute of Proteomics (HIP), and International Centre for Diarrheal Disease Research in Dhaka, Bangladesh (ICDDR,B). Specific Aim #1. Use NAPPA to screen serum of household contacts of cholera index patients, stratifying responses by level of protection from cholera.

5R01DK058536-12,National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,24,"Salmonella infect their animal hosts by entering into and traversing the intestinal epithelial barrier. Penetration of the epithelium is primarily achieved by direct invasion of host epithelial cells using a panel of effector molecules secreted through a Type III secretion apparatus. SipC, which forms part of the tip of this apparatus, has long cytoplasmic N- and C-termini, which nucleate the assembly of actin filament networks that are required for bacterial engulfment. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified a number of host proteins that interact selectively with the C-terminus of SipC. These include proteins that regulate actin assembly and dynamics, as well as proteins that mediate vesicular transport. We hypothesize that Salmonella uses SipC to nucleate the assembly of signaling and cytoskeletal machinery at sites of bacterial attachment to coordinate actin remodeling with the delivery of new membrane to form the nascent phagosome. This hypothesis will be explored in Specific Aim 1.  Salmonella infection triggers the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes to the intestine, which have an important role in clearance of the infection. However, Salmonella can also use phagocytes as vehicles for their systemic dissemination, and the success or failure of the host response lies in the balance between these two processes. We are examining the role of Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) in the migration and function of monocytic cells. Using mice that conditionally lack FAK in cells of the myeloid lineage, we found that infiltration of inflammatory macrophages into the Peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes is impaired in the absence of FAK, and that this surprisingly correlates with reduced bacterial colonization of all tissues examined. Conversely, neutrophil infiltration into the same tissues is enhanced, suggesting a differential regulation of macrophage and neutrophil recruitment to infected tissues. We hypothesize that inflammatory macrophages are necessary for bacterial survival in the tissue microenvironment, by providing a protective niche for bacterial replication and dissemination, and that in the absence of this niche bacteria are more efficiently killed by infiltrating neutrophils. This hypothesis will be tested in Specific Aim 2.  Recent evidence indicates the existence of a novel population of lysozyme-expressing dendritic cells unique to the Peyer's patch, that are the first cells targeted by Salmonella upon transiting the intestinal epithelium. However nothing is known about the role of these cells in Salmonella infection. Characterization of these cells forms the basis for Specific Aim 3.  Together, the results of these studies will provide significant new insight into the mechanisms used by Salmonella to infect their animal hosts, and the role of the innate immune response in combating the infection. The molecular details that emerge from these studies may provide new targets for next generation antibiotics or therapies for the prevention of Salmonellosis.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Infection with pathogenic Salmonella strains causes symptoms ranging from gastritis to potentially fatal systemic disease such as Typhoid Fever. The goals of this research are to define the host cell machinery that is subverted by Salmonella to enter the intestinal epithelium and spread systemically, and to characterize the innate immune responses to Salmonella infection.",Mechanisms Of Salmonella Invasion And Transmigration,2000,2014,"Casanova, James E.",University of Virginia,Charlottesville,VA,55,1,1,-1

Despite this burden of disease, the clinical management of diarrhea has remained largely stagnant since the development of oral rehydration therapy over thirty years ago. Multiple small studies have demonstrated the efficacy of probiotic agents, or beneficial bacteria used to colonize the gut, for improving the clinical course of diarrheal illness in children. However limitations of these small studies, done in areas where diarrhea is caused predominantly by viral pathogens in well nourished children, limit the relevance of these studies in areas where diarrhea remains a serious threat to child health. We propose to evaluate the relative efficacy of Lactobacillus GG (LGG) and Bifidobacterium bifidum (Bb), two promising probiotic agents, in a randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trial for the treatment of diarrhea at the community level in Santa Clara, a town in the Peruvian Amazon where chronic malnutrition and childhood diarrhea are highly endemic. Six hundred and fifty children ages 6 months to 6 years will be randomized to 3 groups, which will receive LGG, Bb, or placebo respectively for 5 days with each episode of diarrhea during the surveillance period. Diarrhea stool specimens will be examined for bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogens. Our multiyear study will allow for the evaluation of treatment with these probiotic agents for all causes of diarrhea and on specific prevalent causes of pediatric diarrhea such as rota virus, enterotoxigenic E. coli, Shigella, Giardia and Campylobacter. Episode-specific outcomes such as time to last unformed stool, and subject-specific outcomes, including overall burden of disease, frequency of adverse events, and changes in nutritional status overtime, will be compared between treatment groups. Intensive study of a longitudinal cohort with stringent monitoring of adverse events will allow us to address many unanswered questions, such as the impact of breastfeeding and malnutrition on therapeutic efficacy and strategies for acceptance of the new therapies.

5P01ES006052-19,National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences,25,"It is widely recognized that high levels of consumption of vegetables are associated with lower risks of  developing several types of cancer. Certain cultivars of broccoli contain singularly elevated levels of the  glucosinolate, glucoraphanin (GR), which yields the isothiocyanate sulforaphane upon hydrolysis. Both  sulforaphane and GR (as a broccoli sprout hot water extract) are inhibitors of carcinogenesis in rodents. The  discovery that GR levels are highest in young broccoli plants (3-day-old sprouts) prompted the hypothesis  that sprouts are safe, effective, inexpensive, and practical means to achieve chemoprevention. Initial clinical  studies have characterized the pharmacokinetics of broccoli sprout preparations in humans and have  established the safety of this food under circumstances of normal consumption patterns. Therefore, the goals  of this project are to use chemical biomarkers to assess the efficacy of chemoprevention interventions with  broccoli sprouts in populations in Qidong, China exposed to high levels of food (aflatoxins) and air-borne  toxicants (alkylanilines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons). The specific aims in Project 4 are (1) to  compare, in a short-term cross-over clinical trial, the bioavailablity of sulforaphane from broccoli sprouts in  two forms: enterically generated from glucoraphanin by gut microflora; or pre-released by treatment with  myrosinase from the plant daikon. Urinary excretion of glucoraphanin/sulforaphane metabolites  (dithiocarbamates) will be measured. Aim 2 will determine the pharmacodynamic impact of the broccoli  sprout intervention on phenanthrene metabolism to phenols, tetraols and mercapturic acids using mass  spectrometry. Aim 3 will extend these findings by determining whether a 3-month placebo-controlled,  randomized broccoli sprout intervention modulates biomarker levels in residents of Qidong.

5R21AI092161-02,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"According to the World Health Organization, diarrhea caused by enteric infections affects some four billion individuals annually throughout the world, resulting in an estimated four million to six million deaths, many in children under five years of age. In the United States, diarrhea is the second most common infectious illness, and in some countries diarrheal diseases account for up to one third of all deaths. In many cases, enteric disease is caused by the ingestion of pathogenic bacteria via contaminated food or water. Once ingested by the host, environmental signals in the gut initiate a virulence gene cascade leading to the production of virulence factors. The expression of these virulence factors, many of which are toxins, effector molecules, and colonization factors, results in a wide variety of debilitating and often deadly diarrheal diseases including travelers' diarrhea, dysentery, and cholera. In cholera the primary virulence factors are the toxin- coregulated pilus (TCP), which is required for the organism to colonize the host, and cholera toxin (CT), which is responsible for the pathology of the disease. The expression of both virulence factors is regulated by ToxT, the paramount regulator of virulence gene expression in Vibrio cholerae. ToxT, a member of the AraC/XylS (A/X) superfamily of regulators, of which there are numerous members throughout the bacterial world, is inhibited by fatty acids present in bile. In the structure of ToxT, a palmitoleic acid bridges the regulatory and DNA binding domains of the transcription factor, locking it in an inactive conformation. Two positively charged lysine side chains, one from each domain, play a critical role in fatty acid binding and, thereby, in the mechanism of virulence gene regulation.   The studies proposed in this application will test the hypothesis that many other enteric bacteria use a similar, if not identical, mechanism to regulate pathogenic activity. The approach will utilize secondary structure prediction and homology modeling to identify candidates from the A/X protein superfamily containing positively charged amino acid residues at positions homologous to those found in ToxT. The effect of fatty acids on virulence gene production in the various candidate organisms will be measured utilizing a lacZ fusion system and confirmed using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), an NMR-based ligand binding assay, and site directed mutagenesis. Preliminary analysis has indicated that a number of pathogenic bacteria, including several types of Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, and Yersinia enterocolitica, contain A/X regulators with homologous positively charged residues and ligand binding pockets. The studies proposed here will confirm if these bacteria use a common, fatty acid mediated mechanism to regulate pathogenic activity, thereby laying the groundwork for development of therapeutics that could be broadly applied to treat enteric bacterial infections causing diseases such as travelers' diarrhea, dysentery, and typhoid fever.",Fatty Acid Related Regulation Of Enteric Infectious Disease,2011,2013,"Kull, Fredrick Jon",Dartmouth College,Hanover,NH,34,1,72,5059
1R21AI099850-01,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Cryptosporidium parvum is an AIDS-OI pathogen and Category B agent that can cause severe watery diarrhea in humans and animals. This parasite can cause prolonged, life threatening infection in immunocompromised individuals, and is responsible for a substantial degree of morbidity and mortality in AIDS patients. Also because the infectious oocysts are highly resistant to chemical stresses, C. parvum is a significant water-  and food-borne pathogen and one of the category B agent in the NIH biodefense program. Currently, no drug is FDA-approved to treat cryptosporidiosis in immunocompromised patients, although a single drug (nitazoxanide) is approved for use in immunocompetent patients in the United States. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new anti-Cryptosporidium drugs, particularly new drugs for AIDS patients. Encouraged by the recent development in repurposing of existing drugs for potential new indications, as well as based on our unexpected observations that a marked drug could strongly inhibit the growth of Cryptosporidium in vitro, we plan to extend our discovery by screening all existing drugs for their potential ant-cryptosporidia activities in vitro and in vivo. Briefly, we will take advantage of established models and assays t achieve the following two aims: Aim 1. To identify potential anti-cryptosporidial compounds from known drugs in vitro using our well- developed and improved qRT-PCR assay. Aim 2. To determine anti-cryptosporidial efficacy of select drugs in vivo using acute and chronic mouse models of cryptosporidial infection. The majority of the compounds being screened are currently or previously marketed drugs. The proposed experiments examine the direct effects of drugs on the parasite growth in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, if satisfactory anti-cryptosporidial activitie in vitro and in vivo are observed among any of the FDS-approved drugs, these effective drugs can be rapidly moved to clinical trials and repurposed to become new drugs to treat cryptosporidial infection in humans, thus accelerating the drug discovery and development against Cryptosporidium. Furthermore, the project will nonetheless produce a large amount of data that profiles the activities of nearly all existing and abandoned drugs. The invaluable data can be used to analyze the structure-activity relationship (SAR) against Cryptosporidium to guide future drug development.

Its infection in AIDS patients can be prolonged and deadly, for which no treatment is yet available. This is largely due to the technical  difficulties in manipulating this parasite in laboratory and to the unusual metabolic features that  are still poorly understood. This project takes advantage of an improved drug testing assay to unbiasedly, directly screen all existing drugs on their efficacies on the parasite growth in vitro.  Top positive drugs will be further tested in vivo in a mouse model of chronic cryptosporidiosis. The majority of tested compounds are marked drugs for which toxicity and pharmacokinetics are known. Therefore, if any effective drugs are identified in this study, they can be quickly moved into clinic trials and/or repurposed as new drugs to treat cryptosporidiosis in humans and/or animals.",Evaluation Of Marketed Drugs For Rapid Development As Anti-Cryptosporidal Agents,2012,2014,"Zhu, Guan ",Texas A&m University,College Station,TX,51,1,-1,1622
7R01AT004435-06,National Center For Complementary and Alternative Medicine,100,"Oral tolerance to foods normally develops during the first few years of life. An aberration of oral tolerance, food allergy, occurs in 6% of children and 3.5% of adults in the United States. Peanut allergy is one of the most common of the food allergies occurring in 1% of young children. Interestingly, approximately only 20% of young children with peanut allergy will develop oral tolerance to peanuts by age five. We propose to utilize a form of treatment, sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) to investigate and possibly hasten the development of oral tolerance to peanuts. This application is based on data from our work and others that allergen-specific SLIT will desensitize and possibly tolerize peanut-allergic subjects. There have not been well-designed previous studies of SLIT for food allergy that have been scientifically rigorous. Our hypothesis is that instituting peanut allergen SLIT early after development of food allergy will clinically desensitize patients by altering basophil/mast cell reactivity and will cause clinical tolerance to develop because of the activity of allergen- specific T regulatory cells. This proposal is based on our preliminary studies that have examined the effects of SLIT in older children with peanut allergy and of oral immunotherapy in peanut- and egg-allergic children. Our approach will be to enroll two cohorts of subjects who have peanut sensitivity (peanut specific IgE > 7 KU/L and significant initial symptoms); one group soon after their development (ages 1 to 5 years) and the second group who have not outgrown their peanut allergy (ages 6 to 11 years) and treat them with peanut SLIT in a prospective randomized, blinded SLIT protocol. We will study the basophil/mast cell reactivity, antigen-specific T cell responses and mucosal and systemic humoral immune responses in these subjects.  We are combining the expertise of scientific investigators from the fields of allergy, immunology and pathology and the resources of our NIH-funded GCRC for our studies. Our specific aims are: (1) Determine if allergen-specific SLIT will cause clinical desensitization and tolerance to develop in peanut allergic young children, (2) Determine if the development of the desensitized state to peanut is associated with the down-regulation of mast cells and basophils, (3) Determine if the development of clinical tolerance to peanuts is associated with an increase in the T regulatory phenotype of antigen-activated peripheral CD4+ T cells and (4) Determine the effect of peanut-specific mucosal and systemic humoral immune responses in SLIT on desensitization and oral tolerance. Completion of the studies will provide new information regarding the cellular and molecular mechanisms of action of oral tolerance and allergen-specific SLIT and provide the foundation for the development of novel treatments for food allergy.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE - PROJECT NARRATIVE:  The project is designed to develop a treatment for food allergy.

5R01AI034036-20,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Toxoplasma gondii is a widespread parasite of domestic and wild animals that also commonly infects humans, where it is an important cause of disease in immunocompromised individuals. T. gondii is also a model for many biological features are conserved in other less-easily studied apicomplexan parasites such as Cryptosporidium and Plasmodium (malaria). For example, this group of parasites shares common pathways for protein secretion, motility, and host cell invasion: adaptations that are responsible for the success of these intracellular parasites. The long-term goal of our studies is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that regulate these conserved pathways in apicomplexan parasites and to define how these adaptations lead to intracellular parasitism. Previous studies have demonstrated the role of actin-based motility in cell invasion, and shown that this process facilitates tissue migration and contributes to pathogenesis. Motility and cell invasion also require calcium-mediated secretion of micronemal proteins, which bind to specific receptors on the host cell or substratum, thus providing traction. The cytoplasmic domains of micronemal proteins link to the motor complex within the parasite, thus bridging substrate attachment with force generation. In the proposed studies, we will define the molecular mechanisms that control three important steps in the function of microneme proteins including, calcium-mediated release, translocation via the motor complex, and proteolytic processing. Importantly, these molecular components and signaling pathways are not found in the host cell, they have been shown to be essential in the parasite using pharmacological and/or genetic analyses, and they are conserved among apicomplexan parasites. Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms that control these events will lead to an increased understanding of unique adaptations that are essential for survival of apicomplexan parasites. They may also lead to improved therapeutic interventions to combat these important pathogens.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our studies are designed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that control protein secretion and motility in apicomplexan parasites. The proposed studies will be conducted using T. gondii, which is an important opportunistic pathogen and NIAID category B Biodefense agent.

Toxoplasma infection in mice provides an excellent experimental model for understanding food borne infections and infections of the brain. The overall goal of this project to gain a deeper understanding of how the mammalian immune system responds to Toxoplasma infection by tracking parasites and immune cells in vivo. Our experimental approach makes extensive use of 2-photon microscopy to visualize the dynamics of parasite and immune cell interaction in living tissues. In the previous funding period, we have assembled the tools to visualize and quantitate interactions between parasites and T cells and other cells of the immune system, and have begun to address the fundamental question of where, when, and how parasites and immune cells interact in vivo. Our initial studies have provided a framework for further exploration and have led to a number of testable hypotheses about the role of T cell-parasite interactions during infection. In the current application, we propose experiments designed to test these hypotheses, and to continue building a more complete picture of the cellular events during Toxoplasma infection.

5R01AI027655-25,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Listeria monocytogenes is a facultative intracellular pathogen that provides an extremely amenable model for basic studies on host-pathogen interactions. Importantly, L. monocytogenes is also a clinically relevant food-borne pathogen that causes a high rate of mortality in pregnant women and the immunocompromised. A primary determinant of L. monocytogenes pathogenesis and a target of the host's immune response is Listeriolysin O (LLO). LLO is a member of a large family of pore-forming cytolysins that is largely responsible for mediating escape of L. monocytogenes from a phagosome and for virulence; LLO-minus mutants are 5-logs less virulent in animal models of infection. LLO activity is a double-edged sword as its activity must be restricted to an acidic phagosome or the host cell will die due to LLO-mediated cell death (referred to as compartmentalization). In Aim I of this proposal the molecular determinants mediating compartmentalization will be determined by using a combination of mutagenesis, cell biology and biochemistry. LLO mutants will be characterized with respect to phosphorylation, ubiquitylation, proteolysis, half-life, and aggregation. In Aim II, the role played by autophagy will be examined with respect to escape from a phagosome and the fate of LLO secreted into the host cytosol. Macrophages that are defective for autophagy will provide an excellent system with which to examine these questions. In Aim III, a newly developed, mariner-based, transposon mutagenesis system will be used to identify the role played by gene-products, other than LLO, on LLO expression, synthesis, secretion and toxicity. These studies should identify the hypothetical host protein(s) that interact with LLO and LLO mRNA to prevent toxicity, and open up new areas of investigations pertaining to LLO expression, synthesis, secretion and toxicity. Lastly, the role of post-translational modifications and autophagy will be examined with respect to the presentation of LLO epitopes in both the MHC Class I and Class II pathways of antigen processing and presentation.

5R01ES008442-12,National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences,25,"This application is a competing renewal of Grant 5-R01ES008442 entitled Methyl Mercury Effects on Adolescent Development. The Seychelles Child development Study (SCDS) has been testing the hypothesis that methyl mercury (MeHg) exposure from consumption of a diet high in fish is associated with adverse health outcomes. Exposure to MeHg from fish consumption is thought to impair cognition and neuro-regulation of the heart. Since 1989, we have been following a cohort of 779 subjects born to mothers who consumed an average of 12 fish-meals per week during pregnancy. The subjects are now approaching 21 years of age. The subjects have been assessed for cognitive and behavioral development. In 2006, the project was expanded with funds from a competing supplement to include measurements of autonomic heart regulation. The subjects themselves habitually consume a diet high in fish. Fish contain both MeHg and nutrients including long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) which are beneficial to brain development and heart function. Preliminary data suggest that prenatal and postnatal exposures to combined MeHg and LCPUFA in fish may be associated with distinct patterns of results. Limited information is available on postnatal exposures however. We will examine the SCDS cohort at approximately 21 and 23 years of age to assess the net cumulative risk of exposure to postnatal MeHg and recent LCPUFA status on cognitive outcomes and cardiovascular parameters. Statistical analyses will employ innovative parametric and non-parametric modeling designed to ascertain the effects on these endpoints of co-exposures to postnatal, adjusted for prenatal MeHg exposure, and/or lifetime cumulative (prenatal and postnatal) exposure to MeHg, and recent exposure to LCPUFA to ascertain the separate risks attendant to these exposures. The Seychelles population has many similarities with that of the US and can therefore serve as a sentinel for the risks and benefits of fish consumption. The low loss to follow-up provides a unique opportunity to continue to study this very well characterized cohort and differentiate prenatal from postnatal MeHg effects as its members move from adolescence to young adult life. The findings from this study will be important as governmental agencies continue to evaluate the scientific data regarding toxic effects and nutrient benefits of a high fish diet. The study should also clarify the risks and benefits of fish consumption in relation to neurocognitive and cardiac morbidity that may not become clinically manifest until later in adulthood.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Human exposure to MeHg is almost exclusively from fish consumption and all fish contain some MeHg. But fish also provide other highly beneficial nutrients, such as long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) that are essential for development and function of the central nervous system (CNS) and appear to mitigate some effects of prenatal mercury exposure. Findings during the past funding period demonstrate beneficial effects of prenatal MeHg, but adverse effects of postnatal MeHg on different neurocognitive and behavioral functions, and a beneficial impact on neuro-regulation of the heart, demonstrating differential net risks or benefits for these functions that are time and organ-dependent and which therefore may require different public health risk considerations and revisions of documents, such as the National Research Council Report (2002). The proposed study makes innovative use of our well-characterized cohort to determine for the first time whether LCPUFA, that actually have a continuing influence on the CNS across the life span, interact with lifetime and recent postnatal MeHg exposure to modulate its influence on neurocognition and cardiac functions. The results should have immediate and important public health implications for agencies that advise the public about fish consumption. If LCPUFA do not interact with postnatal MeHg exposure, as they do with prenatal MeHg exposure, our findings will suggest that public health risks associated with the two exposures may be different and would have to be differentially considered.",Methyl Mercury Effect On Adolescent Development Renewal,1997,2015,"Davidson, Philip W",University of Rochester,Rochester,NY,37,1,214,678
5R01AI080656-04,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Rotaviruses (RVs) are significant viral pathogens that cause life-threatening diarrheal disease in infants and young children worldwide. A fascinating aspect of RVs is that they are viruses that utilize the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for maturation. RVs exhibit a novel morphogenetic pathway that involves nascent subviral particle exit from sites of RNA replication (viroplasms) followed by particle budding through the ER membrane. Transiently enveloped particles appear in the lumen of the ER. The transient envelope is lost in a process involving rearrangement and assembly of the outer capsid proteins. The budding process involves interaction of the nascent subviral particles with the unique RV non-structural protein 4 (NSP4) that functions as an intracellular receptor in the ER membrane. Other remarkable properties of NSP4 include its being the first described viral enterotoxin. Thus, NSP4 has several roles in RV replication and morphogenesis, processes that are novel, complex and poorly understood. These data also highlight the possibility of using NSP4 and RV maturation to discover new mechanisms of cell function and as targets for inhibiting viral replication. The studies proposed in this new, revised grant seek to understand the role(s) of NSP4 in modulating cellular calcium signaling as a mechanism to regulate virus replication and morphogenesis. Our long term goal is to elucidate the mechanisms by which this novel protein controls virus replication and to target these mechanisms to attenuate disease. The central hypothesis of our proposed research is that NSP4 is a key regulator of rotavirus replication and morphogenesis. We predict that the abilities of NSP4 to alter intracellular calcium homeostasis, to modulate ER membrane and viroplasm localization, and to interact with the stalk domain of the capsid spike and VP6 on double-layered particles result in molecular switches that regulate viral morphogenesis. The specific aims of our proposed work are (1) To determine how NSP4 affects calcium homeostasis, and (2) To dissect NSP4 regulation of viral morphogenesis. Because RVs mature in the ER and exit cells using a nonclassical vesicular pathway that is Golgi-independent, we expect to elucidate new mechanisms of complex virus assembly, including new insights into the autophagy pathway and RV subversion of calcium-regulated processes in polarized intestinal cells. These studies are significant and of fundamental interest because intracellular membrane perturbation is not well understood for any non-enveloped virus and several such viruses enter or alter the ER as part of their replication cycles. In addition, modulation of levels of intracellular calcium and intersection with cellular autophagy are important pathways exploited by many viruses. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The studies proposed in this revised grant seek to understand the role(s) of NSP4 in modulating cellular calcium signaling as a mechanism to regulate virus replication and morphogenesis.

5R21AI092268-02,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"We will explore and determine the molecular mechanism for epitope shift, a recently recognized feature of affinity maturation in which somatic hypermutation changes the epitope recognized by mature antibodies from that recognized by germline antibodies. Our published work indicates that affinity maturation leads to both affinity and epitope selection changes, both of which can be critical for developing neutralizing antibodies. To date, this has been unappreciated because previous studies of affinity maturation have focused on cases where maturation improves affinity to an essentially identical epitope. This is the case both for protein antigens and haptens, as exemplified by structural and biochemical studies using hen egg white lysozyme and small haptens. In these cases, affinity maturation improves binding to identical epitopes. The anti-lysozyme antibodies are particularly interesting in this light, because they use large (~1,800E2) interfaces with essentially identical interactions where enhanced affinity arises from increased burial of hydrophobic surface at the edge of the interaction surface. These changes are driven by subtle rearrangements of non-hotspot residues. While the edge of the interaction surface changes in the anti- lysozyme antibodies, these changes do not lead to changes in the epitope recognized. In our model, this is because hot-spot residues are germline encoded. Our proposed work will explore changes hypothesized to occur within the antibody combining site and establish the mechanism whereby these changes cause epitope shifting. We will focus anti-rotavirus VP6 antibodies that use the VH1-46 gene segment.  VP6 is the immunodominant epitope and VH1-46 is the dominant heavy chain gene segment seen in the antibody response against rotavirus. In general, adults produce neutralizing antibodies to rotavirus, but infants do not. This is not due to germline gene usage, but rather it is to more somatic hypermutation in adults. Rotaviruses are the most important cause of severe diarrhea in infants and young children in both the developed world and the developing world. Attenuated virus vaccines have been introduced, however even when properly administered in a controlled setting, these vaccines appear to reduce infection by only ~61%. Additionally, they offer no protection against emerging strains, and require multiple (2 or 3) doses. Second generation vaccines with improved efficacy are sought, and subunit vaccines are an attractive choice. CDC estimates are that even with vaccination ~500,000 people still die annually from rotavirus infection.  Effective development of subunit vaccines is aided by a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms the human immune system employs to recognize antigens and neutralize pathogens. This application will provide molecular immunology paradigms that may influence the choice of antigens, the use of surrogate markers of protection, and the development of new rotavirus vaccines.

As many as 40% of blood culture isolates from bacteremic children and 20% of blood culture isolates in children with severe pneumonia are due to NTS in Africa. While the exact reasons for the high burden and severity of disease due to invasive NTS are incompletely understood, it appears that transmission of NTS may be largely due to human-human contact in Africa. This is in contrast to the largely foodborne route of transmission seen in other areas of the world Differences in host characteristics (high rates of HIV, malnutrition) and differing socio-economic conditions (poor access to clean water and sanitation, more rural environment) may contribute to human-human risk of transmission. In addition, it is possible that pathogen specific differences may also be important in increasing the diversity and virulence of NTS isolates in Africa. We propose to more clearly define the epidemiology of NTS disease in Africa by examining differences in host susceptibility, changes in strain diversity and virulence, and the role of asymptomafic carriage in promofing human-human transmission of NTS.","Prevalence And Correlates Of NTS Bacteremia, Diarrhea And Carriage In Kenya",,,"Walson, Judd L.",University of Washington,Seattle,WA,56,1,224,4915
2R56AI041816-18A1,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"The long-term objective of this research is to understand how an environmental bacterium gains the ability to transition from soil organism to life within mammalian cells. Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) is a facultative intra- cytosolic bacterium that is an increasingly important agent of serious food-borne infections and has been responsible for some of the largest food recalls in US history. The focus of this proposal is on an essential virulence regulatory protein known as PrfA that coordinates the complex and multifaceted Lm transition from life in the outside environment to life within an infected host. Critical to PrfA function is the shift from the low PrfA activity state found in bacteria replicatig outside of host cells to a high activity state following bacterial entry into the host cell. Cytosoic activation of PrfA has profound effects not only on the expression and secretion of Lm virulence gene products, but also on the metabolic state of Lm and on the ability of the bacterium to respond to conditions of stress. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the regulation of PrfA activation is critical for Lm to successfully balance bacterial survival in the outside environment with life within mammalian cells. A combination of genetic, biochemical, and in vivo approaches will be used to elucidate the mechanisms that regulate PrfA activation status as well as to functionally decipher how PrfA activation coordinates different aspects of Lm stress resistance, bacterial cell signaling, and bacterial physiology to enhance bacterial growth and viability within the cytosol. Aim 1 will elucidate the mechanistic links between PrfA activation an different facets of Lm stress susceptibility and resistance. Experiments will clarify how PrfA activation selectively influences stress resistance to enhance bacterial survival within host cells and will identify targets of free radical damage that occur as a result of host inflammatory responses. The focus of Aim 2 is on mechanisms that promote bacterial viability in the cytosol under conditions of PrfA activation. Experiments will functionally define the contributions of two secretion chaperones and a pheromone-encoding lipoprotein known as Lmo2637 to pathogenesis; the secretion of these gene products is induced by PrfA activation and all have apparent roles in maintaining Lm viability within the cytosol. Aim 3 will clarify the molecular pathways leading to PrfA activation within the host and will seek to identify the cofactor that triggers PrfA activation. The ultimate goal of this proposal will be to elucidate the molecular pathways that promote Lm survival within host cells and the transformation of a soil dweller into a cell invader.",Listeria Virulence Gene Expression Within Host Cells,2012,2013,"Freitag, Nancy Elizabeth",University of Illinois At Chicago,Chicago,IL,17,1,-1,1462

EHEC has a very low infectious dose, making it difficult to control epidemiologically. EHEC colonizes the large intestine where it causes attaching and effacing (AE) lesions, and also produces Shiga toxins (Stx) that are responsible for the major symptoms of HUS. We recently reported that EHEC senses three signals to activate transcription of virulence genes: a bacterial aromatic autoinducer (AI-3) produced by the normal gastrointestinal flora, and the hormones epinephrine/norepinephrine produced by the host. These signals are detected by membrane bound sensor kinases that subsequently relay this information to a complex regulatory cascade to activate transcription of virulence genes. We have identified several members of this signaling cascade: the QseBC and QseEF two-component systems, and the QseA and QseD LysR-like regulators. However, many aspects of this regulatory cascade, which are crucial for EHEC virulence, remain poorly understood.

According to the Centers for Disease Control, C. jejuni competes with Salmonella species as the leading cause of bacterial gastroenteritis in the United States. In contrast, C. jejuni is a common commensal organism of the gastrointestinal tracts of wild and agriculturally-important animals, which contributes to the large amount of C. jejuni found in the human food supply leading to sporadic cases of disease. Flagellar motility is the only proven virulence and colonization factor of C. jejuni, required to promote infection of humans and avian species for the development of disease or commensalism. C. jejuni produces a single flagellum at one or both poles of the bacterium. Thus, C. jejuni belongs to a significant group of bacterial pathogens, such as Vibrio, Pseudomonas, and Helicobacter species, that are programmed to produce a limited number of flagella and place these organelles only at the poles, unlike more commonly studied peritrichous bacteria such as E. coli and Salmonella species. We have used C. jejuni as a model system to understand regulation of flagellar gene expression and biosynthesis in polarly-flagellated bacterial pathogens. This regulatory system requires the flagellar export apparatus, the FlgSR two-component system and the FlhF GTPase for expression C54-dependent flagellar genes. In addition, FlhF and the putative ATP- binding protein, FlhG, are required for proper flagellar placement, number, or biosynthesis with FlhG possessing an additional function in septation. The objectives of this proposal are to analyze signaling processes in C. jejuni that mediate proper expression of flagellar genes while using the flagellar regulatory system to promote a deeper understanding into the cellular biology of signaling networks, complex organelle development, and bacterial septation. In Aim 1, we will analyze a novel signaling mechanism occurring between the flagellar export apparatus and the FlgS sensor kinase that leads to activation of the FlgSR system. In Aim 2, we will analyze the biology of FlgR, an NtrC-like protein, which contains a unique C- terminus that allows for a likely alternative mechanism of signal transduction and transcriptional initiation. In Aim 3, we will analyze how FlhF influences flagellar gene expression and biosynthesis and the dual functions of FlhG in controlling polar flagellar number and septation. Accomplishment of these aims will aid in understanding: 1) a unique molecular mechanism of signaling between protein systems in bacteria; 2) alternative mechanisms of transcriptional initiation for an NtrC-like protein; 3) how signaling networks in bacteria are insulated from each other to mediate specificity of signaling; 4) complex organelle development; and 5) aspects of bacterial septation.",Campylbacter Jejuni Flagellar Regulation And Synthesis,2011,2016,"Hendrixson, David R",Ut Southwestern Medical Center,Dallas,TX,51,1,-1,2944
3R01AI091845-03S1,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Vibrio cholerae is a facultative human pathogen that causes the severe diarrheal disease cholera. The ability of V. cholerae to cause disease is dependent upon the regulated expression of virulence factors. For example, the virulence genes encoding for production of cholera toxin and the toxin coregulated pilus appear to be induced early in infection and repressed late in infection before exiting the human gastrointestinal tract. Other genes that are induced late during infection are believed to be important for the establishment of the hyperinfective phenotype exhibited by human shed vibrios, and for survival in the aquatic ecosystem. The mechanisms that control gene expression in vivo are largely unknown. Quorum sensing has been proposed as one potential mechanism to govern late gene expression in vivo. However, the observation that many epidemic V. cholerae strains are quorum sensing insensitive suggests that other regulatory mechanisms must exist. Our laboratory has shown that diketopiperazines inhibit virulence factor production in V. cholerae. In this grant we will test the hypothesis that cyclo(Phe-Pro), a natural diketopiperazine produced by V. cholerae, functions as a signal to modulate virulence gene expression independent of the known quorum sensing systems. Two specific aims are proposed. In specific aim 1 we will characterize cyclo(Phe-Pro) and define genes that are involved in its synthesis . In specific aim 2 we will define the mechanism by which cyclo(Phe-Pro) regulates virulence factor production. These studies will shed light on a novel regulatory system that controls virulence factor production and may facilitate the future development of novel therapeutic approaches for treatment of cholera.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will characterize a potential chemical signal that is involved in the regulated expression of virulence factor production in Vibrio cholerae.

1R01AI099601-01,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Despite being vaccine preventable, rotavirus is the most important cause of severe gastroenteritis among children and kills half a million children each year worldwide. In Zambia, it is responsible for a third of all diarrhea-associated hospitalization and death in children under 5 years. The Centre for Infectious Diseases Research in Zambia (CIDRZ), established a Program for the Awareness and Elimination of Diarrhea (PAED) in 2010 to assist the Ministry of Health in accelerating introduction of rotavirus vaccine and strengthening clinical capacity for diarrheal disease management. Rotarix (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals), an attenuated human oral vaccine based on the G1P [8] strain, has been selected for introduction in Zambia starting early 2012 through a PAED-supported pilot demonstration program. Although vaccines like Rotarix are a cost effective tool against infectious diseases, and international guidelines recommend their widespread implementation, live oral vaccines can be less immunogenic and efficacious in developing world settings as compared with industrialized countries. Reasons behind this phenomenon are not well understood, but may relate to continued maternal antigen exposure and high level maternal immunity that is passed to the fetus/newborn transplacentally and/or through breast milk. Specific hypotheses include: (i) High-level rotavirus-specific maternal immunity (in the form of anti-rotavirus breast milk IgA and transplacental serum IgG) contributes to failed seroconversion following vaccination. (ii) Malnutrition negatively impacts infant immunity and increases the risk of post-vaccination rotavirus gastroenteritis. (iii) Introduction of rotavirus vaccine will alter te molecular epidemiology of circulating rotavirus strains detected in vaccinated children presenting with severe diarrhea. To address these hypotheses, the proposed study will recruit a prospective cohort of 420 mother-infant pairs. Participants will be enrolled at the time of vaccination and followed for up to four years. Baseline immunological status will be ascertained and seroconversion rates determined a month after full immunization. Incident rotavirus gastroenteritis will be monitored in the vaccinated infants whenever episodes of diarrhea occur; through this surveillance, the sero-strains of rotaviruses causing disease will be tracked over the  four year period. Contributions of HIV infection both in mothers and infants, vitamin A and zinc deficiency, weight for age Z-scores as well as mid upper arm circumference will also be assessed. Knowledge gained from this study will inform future interventional trials on strategies to improve rotavirus vaccine effectiveness in the developing world.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Zambia is preparing to introduce routine infant immunization against rotavirus - the most important cause of severe gastroenteritis and diarrhea mortality in children.

5R01ES017875-03,National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences,25,"Current estimates indicate that as many as 100 million people in over 70 countries are drinking water with arsenic (As) concentrations up to 100 times the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline of 10 ug per liter. There is significant variability in progression from As exposure to clinical manifestations of disease, and it is thought that genetic and nutritional factors may together account for a substantial portion of this variability. Thus, this proposal seeks to develop biomarkers that predict risk for the development of arsenicosis. Ingested inorganic As (InAs) is methylated to methylarsonic (MMA) and dimethylarsinic (DMA) acids via folate- dependent one-carbon metabolism. A reduced capacity to fully methylate As to DMA is associated with reduced urinary elimination of As. DMAV is less toxic and has a much shorter circulating half-live than InAs, and it is rapidly excreted in urine. There is great inter-individual variability in As methylation capacity, and epidemiological evidence, including our own, suggests that people who are good methylators are at reduced risk for As-induced skin lesions, cancers and cardiovascular disease. However, a growing body of evidence from in vitro and laboratory animal studies indicates that the trivalent form of MMA, a requisite intermediate in the pathway toward DMA synthesis, is extremely toxic. Our work over the past several years in Bangladesh has made seminal findings regarding the strong impact of nutritional regulation of one-carbon metabolism on the inter-individual variability in As methylation, blood As levels, and risk for arsenic-induced skin lesions, e.g., our clinical trial demonstrated that folic acid supplementation lowered blood As and blood MMA concentrations. Our 1st aim is to conduct a nested case-control study of 1,000 incident premalignant skin lesion cases and 1,000 controls to test the hypotheses that the capacity to methylate As is influenced by As methyltransferase (AS3MT) genotypes and that AS3MT genotypes and As methylation are associated with risk for skin lesions. Our 2nd aim will examine whether polymorphisms in one-carbon metabolism candidate genes are associated with hyperhomocysteinemia (which is very common in this population, and is associated with reduced capacity to methylate As to DMA), with methylation of As, methylation of leukocyte DNA, and with risk for skin lesions. We will also examine whether these associations are influenced by folate status. Collectively, these aims will allow us to identify of a set of biomarkers (As metabolites, leukocyte DNA methylation, folate, B12, Hcys, and SNPs) to identify sub-groups of individuals who may be at increased risk for As-induced pathology utilizing biological specimens that are already in hand. These studies will also resolve the critical issue of whether or not a higher capacity to methylate As is beneficial. Results of these studies will create opportunities for evaluation of interventions among high risk groups. They will also result in the identification of biomarkers to facilitate targeted therapies that exploit the mechanisms involved in susceptibility, resulting in low-risk, low-cost therapeutic strategies that could potentially reduce disease risk for hundreds of thousands of people.","Biomarkers For Arsenic Toxicity: Genetics, Epigenetics And Folate",2010,2013,"Gamble, Mary Velesca",Columbia University Health Sciences,New York,NY,37,1,-1,4833
5R01GM084383-04,National Institute of General Medical Sciences,93,"SUMMARY Evolution has enlisted a large variety of posttranslational modifications to provide temporal, spatial and functional regulation of the protein machinery of the cell. This project focuses on a specific example of a type that has seemingly been borrowed from the secretory pathway of eukaryotic cells, glycosylation, but might actually have first evolved in the cytoplasm of bacterial cells. We propose that complex cytoplasmic glycosylation exerts unique glycoregulatory functions in eukaryotes, and is subject to distinct controls relative to `conventional' protein glycosylation in the secretory pathway. The initial organism of analysis is the social amoeba Dictyostelium, and the target of the pathway studied here is Skp1, an adaptor of the SCF class of E3 ubiquitin ligases whose targets are frequently activated by phosphorylation and for which there may be a need for an independent mode of covalent regulation. Most remarkable is that this modification involves six enzymatic steps resulting in the assembly of a pentasaccharide attached to a highly conserved residue of proline. This modification, with a structural richness rivaling that of a peptide, is hypothesized to target only Skp1 and modulate its regulation of a critical developmental transition (culmination). Genetic manipulation of prolyl hydroxylase expression controls the O2-requirement for development suggesting a normal role for this enzyme in O2-regulation. Recent analysis of the effects of disrupting enzyme genes required for the sequential hydroxyproline-dependent glycosylation of Skp1 gives evidence for additional levels of hierarchical regulation of O2-dependent development, which is to be characterized in this project. Our recent discovery of the last enzyme (AgtA) needed to construct the pentasaccharide has positioned us finally to address these ideas genetically and biochemically. At the outset, we will in aim 1 define the linkages of the two &#191;-linked galactose sugars whose additions appear to be catalyzed by AgtA, which will enable chemical synthesis of the glycan for the later aims. Aim 2 will examine the basis for apparent AgtA processivity in adding the two sugars, and how Skp1 and the catalytic and &#191;-propeller-like domains of AgtA mutually regulate each other's activity, hypothesized to be associated with quality control. Aim 3 will employ reverse genetic and epistatic analysis of the glycosylation genes to test whether hierarchical regulation is linear or involves parallel signaling pathways. In addition, new antibodies will be developed to monitor progressive variations in Skp1 glycosylation in the cells which signal development. Finally, to identify the functionally most important features of the modification pathway, aim 4 will carry out tests for the evolutionary conservation of Skp1 glycoregulation in the apicomplexan Toxoplasma gondii, the agent for human toxoplasmosis. The knowledge gained is expected to generate new ideas of how the proteome is regulated in select protists in response to external signals such as O2 and internal signals such as sugar metabolites.",Glycoregulation Of Skp1 In The Cytoplasm And Nucleus,2009,2013,"West, Christopher M.",University of Oklahoma Hlth Sciences Ctr,Oklahoma City,OK,42,1,-1,3998
2R01AI073904-04,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Listeria monocytogenes and Shigella flexneri are human intestinal pathogens that replicate in the cytosol of infected cells and spread directly from  primarily infected cells to neighboring cells. The dissemination process is a fundamental aspect of pathogenesis and spreading-defective bacterial mutants are essentially avirulent. The ability of L. monocytogenes and S. flexneri to spread from cell to cell is related to their ability to dispay actin-based motility in the cytosol of infected cells. These bacteria produce virulence factors tha lead to the recruitment at their surface of an essential host cell actin nucleator, the ARP2/3 complex. This results in actin polymerization at one pole of the bacteria, which propels the rods throughout the cytosol. Seminal electron microscopy studies revealed that, when bacteria reach the cell cortex, they form plasma membrane extensions that protrude into the cytosol of neighboring cells. These protrusions are resolved in the receiving cells into double membrane vacuoles, from which the pathogens escape by producing virulence factors that disrupt the integrity of eukaryotic membranes. In contrast to our advanced understanding of the molecular mechanisms supporting cytosolic actin-based motility, the mechanisms supporting pathogen dissemination through membrane protrusion formation are unresolved. To address this gap in knowledge, we have developed innovative procedures for imaging intracellular pathogen dissemination and identified bacterial and cellular factors specifically required for the formation/resolution of membrane protrusions and double membrane vacuoles upon L. monocytogenes infection. Here, we propose to gain the first mechanistic insight into (Aim1) the cellular factors involved in actin network formation in L. monocytogenes protrusions, (Aim2) the bacterial factors involved in L. monocytogenes protrusion formation and resolution, (Aim3) the cellular factors involved in L. monocytogenes double membrane vacuole maturation and (Aim4) the bacterial and cellular factors supporting S. flexneri dissemination.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Various intracellular pathogens have evolved the ability to manipulate host cell processes in order to disseminate from infected cells to neighboring cells. In this application, we present our plans to gain the first mechanistic insight into the bacterial and cellular factors supporting pathogen dissemination through formation of plasma membrane protrusions.

Shigella spp. are the causative agent of bacillary dysentery  (shigellosis) and the majority of infections occur in countries with inadequate health care and unsafe food  and water supplies; however. Shigella outbreaks are a significant problem for industrialized nations as well.  The signature feature of this disease is exhibited by an intense inflammatory reaction manifested clinically as  passage of bloody stools. This project focuses on novel strategies used by S. flexneri to promote tissue  invasion, which elicits the inflammatory response leading to PMN recruitment. Contrary to current dogma, we  hypothesize that speciflc bacteria-host interactions that occur at the apical epithelial surface of I EC are  critical for Shigella pathogenesis. To test this hypothesis. Specific Aim 1 will dissect the molecular  mechanisms by which S. flexneri regulates the tight junction proteins. The goal of this aim will be to  determine the S. flexneri genes that regulate the specific tight junction proteins ZO-1 and ZO-2. In Specific  Aim 2 we will determine how the Shigella secreted protein, SepA, promotes tissue invasion and disease  pathogensis from the apical surface: SepA is the major protein secreted by S. flexneri (in vitro), and is an  autotransporter serine protease encoded by the virulence plasmid. This aim will examine important  interactions that occur between SepA and the lEC apical surface, which are critical for the ability of S.  flexneri to elicit a pro-inflammatory response leading to the recruitment of PMN. Finally, in Specific Aim 3, we  will determine the molecular mechanism by which S. flexneri governs HXA3 efflux from the apical membrane  domain during S.flexneri infection. We speculate that HXAS is required for neutrophilic breach of the  intestinal epithelium during S. flexneri infection. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms that  orchestrate the apical release of HXAS will be crucial to designing improved therapies to augment host  defense and attenuate detrimental intestinal inflammation during Shigella infection. Ultimately, understanding  the molecular mechanisms of S. flexneri entry and induction of pro-inflammatory responses will provide to  new insights for controlling the massive inflammatory pathology underiying shigellosis.",Shigellosis: Role Of Intestinal Epithelium,,,"Mccormick, Beth A",Massachusetts General Hospital,Boston,MA,26,1,106,4851
5R01ES005116-21,National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences,25,"This project will continue to focus on the identification of environmental risk factors for hepatocellular cancer (HCC) and the development of early biomarkers of disease. In ongoing studies, we demonstrated that, in conjunction with hepatitis B or C virus infection, elevated levels of biomarkers of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) exposure and oxidative stress are associated with increased HCC risk in Taiwan. These studies are using cases and controls nested in the Cancer Screening Program (CSP) cohort established by our collaborator Dr. Chien-Jen Chen in Taiwan. A total of almost 24,000 subjects were recruited between 1990-1991 and by the end of the next grant period (July 2014), at least 700 HCC cases will have been identified. We will continue to determine levels of several biomarkers (AFB1- and PAH-albumin, urinary aflatoxin metabolites, 8-oxo-guanine and 15-F2t-isoprostane) in baseline samples from newly identified cases and controls in the CSP cohort. The larger sample size will provide more statistical power to test new hypotheses related to methylation and HCC risk. Repeat blood samples from this cohort have allowed us to demonstrate that gene-specific methylation of tumor DNA circulating in blood can be detected years prior to clinical diagnosis and that the frequency of methylation is significantly higher in those who go on to develop HCC than in those who do not. While these studies analyzed one candidate gene at a time, we now propose to use Illumina arrays interrogating 27,000 CpG sites to analyze liver tissues to more broadly select appropriate genes to improve screening. We will use our sample bank to assay paired tumor/adjacent tissues from Taiwan but also expand these studies to US HCC cases. Genes determined to be differentially methylated will be analyzed in DNA from plasma collected in the CSP cohort from cases prior to diagnosis and in controls to determine the predictive value of the methylation markers. We will use the same approach in US cases to determine whether plasma DNA methylation predicts recurrence in those undergoing surgery for HCC. We will also explore whether WBC DNA gene-specific methylation of these genes in baseline bloods predicts HCC risk within the CSP cohort. In addition to gene-specific methylation, it is now known that global methylation levels are decreased (hypomethylation) in tumors and several studies have now demonstrated decreased WBC DNA methylation in cases compared to controls. Thus, we propose to also investigate global methylation in tissue and WBC DNA, determining their correlation. We will determine whether global methylation is decreased in tumor compared to adjacent tissues and decreased in WBC DNA of cases compared to controls. We will also determine the correlations of methylation to biomarkers of environmental exposures. These studies will help in the identification of high risk individuals and development of screening methods.

Despite the enormity of the problem, little is know about the pathogenesis of the enteritis, due to lack of a relevant mouse model for the intestinal form of Salmonella disease. We have recently reported the development of a mouse model of Salmonella colitis with diarrhea that mimics human infection. This model involves oral infection of mice possessing a wild-type natural resistance (Slc11A1 or Nrammp1) locus and pre-treated with kanamycin. Infected mice develop pan-colitis and diarrhea accompanied by alterations in colonic epithelial ion transport physiology.

1R15AI099977-01,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Listeria monocytogenes is a foodborne bacterial pathogen with the ability to grow at refrigeration temperatures, and is thus a psychrotolerant organism. It is an intracellular pathogen and its molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis have been studied extensively. In order to grow at low temperatures psychrotolerant organisms must adjust their fatty acid compositions in order to maintain membrane fluidity. Under normal conditions almost the entire complement (more than 90%) of L. monocytogenes fatty acids are branched-chain fatty acids, in contrast to other Gram-positive bacteria that typically have about 40% straight-chain fatty acids. Fatty acid anteiso C15:0 increases in low-temperature grown bacteria by a combination of fatty acid shortening and branching switching from iso to anteiso fatty acids, and plays a key role in increasing membrane fluidity. Study of branched-chain fatty acid-deficient mutants has shown they are significantly impaired in low temperature growth, tolerance of various stresses, and virulence. This indicates that the physical structure and optimum function of the Listeria membrane is dependent on a high content of branched-chain fatty acids, and deficiency in these has major impacts on the physiology and virulence of the organism. Mutant and precursor feeding studies have revealed the existence of a novel but undefined pathway of fatty acid biosynthesis from short straight- and branched-chain carboxylic acid precursors, in addition to the normal pathway from branched-chain amino acids. We propose to study the mechanism of branched-chain fatty acid switching, define the pathway of fatty acid biosynthesis from carboxylic acids, and manipulate the membrane fatty acid composition, and hence fluidity, in an extreme fashion and examine its impact on the physiology and pathogenesis of the organism. The major determinant of fatty acid branching switching appears to reside in the temperature- responsive catalytic properties of the enzyme &#191;-keto acyl carrier protein synthase III (FabH) that carries out the first condensation reaction in the fatty aid biosynthesis pathway. In specific aim I we will combine mutagenesis, functional and in silico modeling, protein biochemistry and kinetic analyses to probe the mechanisms underlying temperature-dependent variation of substrate specificities of FabH.

3R01AI097405-01S1,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"These cases heralded the onset of epidemic cholera, with subsequent rapid spread throughout the country, facilitated by the major disruptions of the public health infrastructure associated with the January 12, 2010, earthquake. In this setting, there is a critical public health need to better understand cholera transmission in Haiti, and assess the possible future course of the disease on the island and the impact of various proposed interventions. At a more general level, the Haiti situation provides an ideal setting to monitor the transition from of cholera from epidemic to endemic disease, with a focus on understanding development of environmental reservoirs, routes of transmission, risk factors for illness, and evolutionary changes within the microorganism itself. We would note, in particular, the uniqueness of the situation, with the apparent clonality of the infecting strain providing an opportunity to follow development of strain diversity across time, with a known starting point (October, 2010), in an island setting where there has been no cholera for over 50 years.  To address these issues, we are proposing a series of studies based in the Gressier region of Haiti, where the University of Florida has had ongoing relationships with communities and community leaders for close to 15 years, and where our College of Public Health and Health Professions is completing construction of a microbiology laboratory/research facility. Specific aims of the project will include the following: 1) Identification of V. cholerae in household members and in the environment: this will include surveillance in a school-based cohort of approximately 1,200 households, with follow-up of all diarrheal episodes by culture, and monitoring of all family members (symptomatic and asymptomatic) for a 4 week period after each family index case; and identification and systematic monitoring of household water sources and environmental reservoirs for V. cholerae. 2) Assessment and comparison of evolutionary changes in clinical and environmental V. cholerae isolates, making use of VNTR and whole genome SNP analysis. 3) Further refinement and validation of mathematical models of cholera transmission, including assessments of the impact of immunization and other interventions on transmission. Activities will focus on agent-based simulation models, using data from the field studies in Gressier for calibration. Models will be integrated into public health efforts to anticipate progression and transmission of cholera in Haiti, and the impact of proposed interventions.","Cholera Transmission In Gressier Region, Haiti",2011,2015,"Morris, John Glenn",University of Florida,Gainesville,FL,12,1,180,1635
5R01AI046433-13,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Understanding how and where a particular virulence protein is displayed to the host is critical to understanding the role that protein contributes to pathogenesis. This issue is of central importance for understanding the pathogenesis of any of the myriad serious diseases caused by the Gram- positive pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus). What is remarkable is that is that while this bacterium secretes upwards of 100 different polypeptides, it exclusively uses the General Secretory (Sec) pathway for protein export. A key question is how this single pathway can coordinate the secretion and folding of virulence proteins and how these proteins are then trafficked to their final destinations. An important insight into how secretion, folding and trafficking may be coordinated has come from our identification of the ExPortal, a single membrane microdomain that accumulates a high concentration of Sec translocons and accessory biogenesis factors including HtrA and Sortase. Our hypothesis is that the ExPortal functions as an organelle to promote the interaction of nascent unfolded polypeptides secreted by Sec with accessory factors required for folding and biogenesis in order to coordinate these activities with protein trafficking pathways. A more fundamental understanding of secretion and trafficking will require an understanding of the structural basis of ExPortal organization. In this regard, an important advance has been our observation that the ExPortal has characteristics of a membrane microdomain, in that it has an asymmetric lipid content enriched for specific anionic phospholipids. How this asymmetry is maintained, and whether it is necessary for ExPortal function are questions to be addressed in this proposal. Analysis of ExPortal asymmetry will also allow an investigation of how pathways for membrane targeting of presecretory proteins may direct their post-secretory fate, and how the innate immune system, specifically cationic antimicrobial peptides, may directly target the anionic ExPortal to disrupt secretion of surface proteins and toxins. This latter analysis will also serve as the basis for biochemical characterization of the ExPortal and for genetic screens to identify factors required to support ExPortal organization. This analysis may reveal potential drug targets that can be exploited to disrupt the essential processes of protein secretion and trafficking in S. pyogenes and potentially other pathogenic bacteria. )      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We have previously shown that the secretion of toxins and virulence-associated surface proteins by the Gram-positive pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes occurs through a single small region of the membrane that we named the ExPortal. In this project, we will investigate how the ExPortal is assembled by looking at the types of negatively charged lipids that are enriched at the ExPortal, to find streptococcal genes that encode factors required to form the ExPortal and how this unique lipid composition may make it the specific target of host defense peptides with positive charge. This information will be valuable for development of drugs that can mimic these peptides to target the ExPortal to disrupt toxin secretion in S. pyogenes and other pathogenic streptococci.",PROTEASE AND ROP GENES IN S.

5R01AI043521-15,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Salmonella spp. are a cause of significant worldwide morbidity and mortality. These organisms primarily cause two clinical manifestations: typhoid fever and gastroenteritis. During oral infection, salmonellae interact with the host innate immune system within the gut and, after passing through the intestinal epithelial barrier, within host cells. A key component of the innate immune system in these locations are antimicrobial peptides (APs): ubiquitous proteins that destroy bacterial membranes. PhoP-PhoQ (PhoPQ) and PmrA-PmrB (PmrAB) are Salmonella spp. two-component regulatory systems (TCSs) that detect host signals and/or activate genes during infection. One signal these systems have been shown to sense in vitro are APs, and this sensing leads to modification of the lipopolysaccharide that covers the bacterial surface. An outcome of these modifications is increased resistance to AP-mediated killing. While much is known in vitro about the signals that activate these TCSs and the phenotypes that result from PhoPQ and PmrAB induction, little is known about the in vivo signals or about the role that PmrAB-mediated LPS modifications play in altering the innate immune response. Thus we will pursue the hypotheses that APs are an in vivo activating signal and that the LPS modifications that protect against AP killing also dampen multiple aspects of the innate immune response. Furthermore, we will investigate the PmrAB TCS and its function in the strict human pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, where this important regulatory system has been poorly characterized. These studies will provide a greater understanding of the adaptation of salmonellae to the in vivo environment and shed light on ways to interfere with in vivo induced mechanisms of pathogenesis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Salmonella spp. are a cause of significant worldwide morbidity and mortality. During infection, the bacterium senses and responds to host derived signals. In sensing this environment, the bacterium modifies its surface to aid survival in the harsh host milieu.

5R01AI030479-23,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Salmonella are facultative intracellular pathogens which cause significant diseases in humans and animals. These organisms are responsible for several disease syndromes, including enteric (typhoid) fever, gastroenteritis, bacteremias and focal infections. Typhoid fever is a severe systemic illness which is mostly a problem in the developing world and in travelers. Nontyphoidal salmonella infections are increasing in the USA and are largely associated with contaminated food. Salmonellae infections are most severe in infants, the elderly, and in immunosuppressed individuals. This grant proposes to study the mechanism by which Salmonellae survive host innate immune killing. Innate immune killing involves the non-antigen specific mechanisms by which animals eliminate invading bacteria. Included in innate immune mechanisms are antimicrobial peptides produced at mucosal surfaces and within phagocytic cell granules and cytokines produced in response to recognition of bacterial lipid A. Pathogens such as Salmonellae have mechanisms to resist these killing mechanisms that are environmentally regulated. The genes encoding these mechanisms are the subject of this grant. They include the virulence regulators PhoP/PhoQ that respond to signals within host tissues and induce genes necessary for resistance to innate immune killing. These regulators are essential for human and animal virulence. PhoP/PhoQ regulate genes involved in surface remodeling of bacteria. These genes include those responsible for modification of the lipid and protein components of the outer membrane. This grant proposes to define the mechanism by which the PhoQ sensor histidine kinase is activated in response to environmental signals. This grant will also study the mechanisms by which the PhoP/Q regulated remodeling of membrane lipids occurs and its role in bacterial virulence and the structure. The specific aims of this proposal are to define the structure and function of PhoQ, the genes and proteins involved in membrane remodeling, microbial virulence and resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides.",Phop Regulon And Salmonella Virulence,1991,2015,"Miller, Samuel I.",University of Washington,Seattle,WA,56,1,224,1549
5R01AI075037-04,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Project Summary The goal of this research program is to test the hypothesis that dendritic cells (DCs) of the gastro intestinal tract process lumenal antigens by Fc-epsilon-RI-IgE mediated uptake, thereby affecting the intestinal inflammatory response and type I hypersensitivity. Fc-epsilon-RI, the high affinity IgE Fc-receptor, is a multimeric immune recognition receptor that binds IgE through a monovalent epitope in its alpha chain. Antigen-induced crosslinking of the IgE-Fc-epsilon-RI complex causes cell activation via the signaling subunits of the receptor (Fc-epsilon-RI-beta and a dimer of the common gamma chain). A unique feature of Fc-epsilon- RI is its cell type- and species-specific expression pattern. In mice, the receptor is expressed only as a heterotetramer (alpha, beta, and two gamma chains) on mast cells and basophils. In humans, Fc-epsilon-RI assembles as a heterotetramer on mast cells and basophils, but additionally also as a heterotrimer lacking the beta subunit. Uniquely, the human heterotrimeric form of Fc-epsilon-RI is expressed on antigen presenting cells, including DCs in the intestine. Surface expression of the receptor correlates with allergic diseases, and controls IgE-mediated cell activation during the allergic response. Unlike other multimeric immune recognition receptors, surface expression is regulated at the level of co-translational assembly of subunits in the endoplasmic reticulum; but the mechanism of regulation remains unknown. Aim 1 will elucidate structural features of individual Fc-epsilon-RI subunits that dictate receptor assembly and thus surface expression of Fc- epsilon-RI complexes. Aim 2 will determine if the human trimeric Fc-epsilon-RI functions on DCs or macrophages to present antigen via IgE-mediated uptake pathways. This set of experiments will use Fc- epsilon-RI-expressing murine cells that allow us to study functional consequences of receptor-mediated antigen presentation for T cell activation in the MHC class II and the MHC class I pathways.

5P42ES004940-23,National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences,25,"The human bladder is the most sensitive internal organ to arsenic-induced carcinogenesis. The bladder is exposed to inorganic arsenicals and methylated metabolites both systemically and via the urine. Methylated metabolites of arsenic have been found to be more cytotoxic than inorganic arsenicals. The UROtsa cell, an immortalized human urothelium cell, has become an accepted system for examining the toxic effects of arsenicals to the bladder. Year-long chronic low-level exposure of arsenite [1 microM As(III)] or the more toxic arsenic metabolite [monomethyl-arsonous acid; 50 nM MMA(III)] transformed UROtsa cells such that they formed tumors when injected into immuno-deficient mice. Current studies indicate that much shorter exposures (3 months) to low-level MMA(III) is sufficient to allow them to grown in soft agar and form tumors in immuno-deficient mice. These results indicate that MMA (III) causes critical, irreversible events in UROtsa cells in the first 3 months of exposure. Thus the Goal of this proposal is to find the critical events that short-term, low-level As(III) or MMA(III) causes in UROtsa cells resulting in their eventual transition into malignantly transformed cells. To accomplish this goal we will do low-level, short-term (0-3) exposures of UROtsa cells to arsenicals [1 microM As(III) and 50 nM MMA(III)] to determine the minimal exposure and time required to malignantly transform these cells. Once this minimal exposure time point is established we will examine the cells for changes in specific alterations in macromolecules, signaling systems, or regulatory systems resulting in the irreversible changes. Since previous studies have found reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by low-level exposure to As(III) and MMA(III), we will determine if these early effects of arsenicals on UROtsa cells are mediated by ROS generation. To determine if low-level arsenicals can transform normal human bladder cells, primary cultures of human bladder cells will be similarly examined. Lastly pivotal events in the transformation of bladder cells by low-level arsenicals will be examined as possible biomarkers in exposed populations. Overall, these studies will clarify the toxic effects of low-level arsenic in a human bladder model and provide potential biomarkers for arsenic-induced  bladder injury.",Project 1: Critical Events In The Transformation Of Human Bladder Cells,,,"Gandolfi, A J",University of Arizona,Tucson,AZ,4,1,167,-1

The population relying on domestic wells in New England is subject to lifetime risks for lung and bladder cancers at a staggering 125 in 1 million, ranked second only to that of western states at 152 in 1 million. This risk is likely an underestimate because newer and more data from Maine and New Hampshire have found both higher As concentrations and a higher percentage of wells tested. In 17 towns of central Maine, the Columbia team has found that the percentage of domestic wells exceeding EPA MCL levels for As, Rn, U  and Mn are 31%, 29%, 4% and 4%, respectively. Eight percent of well waters have As and Rn both exceeding MCLs. Arsenic testing and treatment will be promoted in this central Maine community before up scaling iin the state of Maine. Our goal is to establish a community engagement working model applicable for risk reduction of domestic well users in New England region, with the following specific aims:  Aim 1. Identify and engage community stakeholders. In year one, a community advisory committee will be formed to guide implementation.  Aim 2. Determine and reduce barriers for testing. By year five, the percentage of residents with private wells in central Maine who have their well water tested for arsenic will double compared to baseline.  Aim 3.

There are currently no effective preventive measures or cures and tools for diagnosis are imperfect. This situation calls for innovative strategies to precisely define the molecular and cellular pathways in food allergy both so that novel diagnostic markers predicting risk of allergic reaction can be identified and so that new candidate targets for therapy can be identified. The known associations of several atopic conditions with activating polymorphisms in components of IL-4/13 receptors, along with our preliminary observation of intense food anaphylaxis in mice harboring an activating variant of IL-4R&#191;, provide support for our central hypothesis: that IL-4 signaling is critical in food anaphylaxi, driving TH2 responses, mast cell expansion and suppression of Treg. F709 mice, in which the inhibitory cytosolic ITIM motif of IL-4R&#191; is disrupted, will be used to test the hypothesis. Unlike their wild-type Y709 counterparts which are tolerant to dietary antigens, they develop robust IgE responses to ingested proteins, intestinal mast cell expansion and full-blown anaphylactic reactions upon enteral challenge. This phenotype is unique among murine food allergy models, closely mimicking food allergy in humans. The F709 system provides a powerful resource both for focused analysis of direct IL-4 effects on mast cells T cells and intestinal epithelium and for probing the interactions between mast cells, IgE antibodies, TH2 and Treg cells in the development of food allergy.

Prenatal exposure to arsenic has been associated with poor birth outcomes as well as increased risk for cancer later in life. While detrimental health effects have been linked to in utero exposure to arsenic, the underlying biological mechanisms have yet to be identified. Using a Thai cohort, we recently showed that in utero exposure to arsenic results in profound genome-wide alterations in transcript levels, and these transcripts enrich for the nuclear factor-kappa beta (NF-:B) pathway. In preliminary data, we have utilized next-generation sequencing to establish that arsenicosis may be associated with altered DNA methylation patterns in CpG islands of genes of the NF-:B pathway. Taken together, these data suggest that arsenic exposure may influence both genomic and epigenomic deregulation of the NF-:B pathway. The results have piqued our interest in understanding whether in utero exposure to arsenic may result in potentially heritable epigenetic changes to DNA. Based on the preliminary findings and our interest in understanding mechanisms by which prenatal exposure to arsenic may affect health later in life, we propose this study. Here we will examine the modulation of this pathway in newborns in Gsmez Palacio, Mexico and will assess two potential contributors to this modulation, namely epigenetic alterations and genetic variation. The central hypothesis is that exposure to arsenic alters newborn expression of the NF-:B inflammatory response pathway, and that this modulation is influenced by newborn genetics and epigenetics. This research will, in a comprehensive manner, examine the effects of in utero exposure to arsenic on the signaling of the NF-:B pathway in newborns in Mexico.

Typhi) is the etiologic agent of typhoid fever in humans and can cause life-threatening infection in normal hosts. Current typhoid vaccines are only moderately immunogenic and protective. Improvements in vaccine technology have been constrained by the lack of a small animal model. S. Typhi is highly adapted to humans and fails to cause progressive infection in normal mice. S. Typhimurium- murine interactions are used to model S. Typhi-human interactions, but murine typhoid and human typhoid exhibit major differences in both pathogen and host determinants. In the application, we report a breakthrough in the development of a small animal model for the study of human typhoid fever, using NOD-scid IL2rgamma null mice engrafted with CD34+ human hematopoietic stem cells from T-cell depleted umbilical cord blood. In preliminary studies, we have shown that S. Typhi Ty2 can replicate in vivo within engrafted mice following intraperitoneal inoculation to cause lethal infection that recapitulates crucial features of human typhoid. In contrast, S. Typhi is unable to cause productive infection in non-engrafted NOD-scid IL2rgamma null animals or immunocompetent NOD controls. This application describes a pilot project to evaluate this new model and rigorously test the hypothesis that S. Typhi requires human mononuclear cells to replicate in vivo.

2R01AI064616-06A1,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular parasite that causes severe disease in immunocompromised individuals and congenitally infected neonates. Toxoplasma also serves as a model system for the study of related apicomplexan parasites including Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria. Intracellular survival of these organisms is critically dependent on the ability of the parasite to actively invade their host cell, establish a replication-permissive vacuole, and avoid host cell defenses.  Apicomplexan parasites share a unique mechanism for invasion that involves the formation of a tight junction between the invading parasite and the host cell called the moving junction (MJ). The MJ is believed to form a stable anchor for the parasite to invade the host cell and also serve as a molecular sieve that modifies the nascent vacuole to render it non-fusogenic with the host endocytic pathway. The Toxoplasma MJ consists of micronemal AMA1 on the parasite's surface connected to a macromolecular complex of rhoptry neck proteins (RONs 2/4/5/8) that are injected into the host cell. While RON2 spans the host membrane and establishes the link to AMA1, the remaining members of the complex are surprisingly on the cytoplasmic face of the host membrane and how they function in invasion is largely unknown. We have disrupted the coccidial-specific component RON8 and shown that while not essential, this protein plays an important role in parasite invasion in vitro and in virulence in vivo. As the remaining members are conserved in the Apicomplexa and believed to be essential, this indicates that apicomplexans contain a conserved core complex that is required for invasion, which is enhanced in the coccidia via RON8. This is supported by our recent development of a conditional knockout for RON5, which shows that this protein plays a critical role in assembly of the complex and that the MJ complex is indeed essential for invasion.  Our objectives in this first  renewal application are to conduct an in depth functional analysis of the MJ complex and determine its architecture. Specifically, we will first focus on RON8 to determine how this component enhances invasion and links the complex to the host cell. We will then exploit the conditional knockout of RON5 to study its role in the organization and function of the MJ complex. Lastly, we will explore the architecture of the complex by determining its stoichiometry and identifying key interactions of its component proteins. These studies will open completely new insight into the mechanism by which apicomplexan parasites use this novel invasion machine to infect their mammalian hosts and cause disease.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Toxoplasma gondii is an intracellular parasite that infects up to a third of the world's human population and causes serious disease or death in immunocompromised patients and neonates.

The studies will focus on two allergic conditions relevant to the mission of the agency, namely allergic asthma and food allergy (milk) and utilize clinical models (segmental allergen challenge and oral immunotherapy for food tolerance induction) as a foundation for our basic research studies. The MGH/Harvard AADCRC bench research will explore the balance of T effector and T regulatory activity in asthma and food allergy and the ability of tolerogenic DCs to affect this balance. Aim #1 of the Human Studies Core is to recruit, enroll and characterize allergic asthmatic and allergic nonasthmatic subjects for the segmental allergen challenge protocol for Project #1, including clinical characterization of the subjects and conducting the segmental allergen challenge procedure and imaging studies. These studies will assess whether allergic asthmatics and allergic nonasthmatics are fundamentally different in terms of T cell effector and T regulatory cell function and also assess whether allergic airway inflammation correlates with physiologic measures such as bronchial hyperresponsiveness and airway physiology utilizing novel and innovative PET-CT imaging techniques. Aim #2 is to conduct Project #2, a milk oral immunotherapy (OIT) tolerance induction trial, and to collect blood before and following milk tolerance induction to assess T effector and T regulatory cell function and other in vitro measures of allergic sensitization in relation to clinical outcomes of milk OIT. Aim #3 involves collection of blood and bronchoalveolar lavage samples following segmental allergen challenge and during milk OIT for Project #3, a study of the ability of tolerogenic dendritic cells (DC) to induce T regulatory cells in subjects with allergic asthma and milk allergy. Project #3 is integrated into the segmental allergen challenge protocol and the milk OIT trial to facilitate collection of samples and translation of basic immunologic discovery to clinical allergic conditions.

5R01AI040944-16,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Our laboratory has been investigating the immunobiology of the Neisserial porin PorB for the last two decades. We first began by investigating the use of this protein as a potential anti-Neisserial candidate, but through this work we found that this protein had unique immune stimulatory abilities above and beyond its own potential use as a vaccine. We found that PorB can be used as an immune adjuvant for vaccines and that this ability was directly related to its ability to stimulate antigen presenting cells (APC) and increase expression of the costimulatory molecule CD86 and class II MHC. Moreover, we found that the ability of PorB to stimulate and activate antigen presenting cells was directly due to an interaction with the pattern recognition receptor, TOLL-like Receptor 2 (TLR2) and requires the TLR adaptor protein MyD88. We have further shown, as described in the preliminary data section and in that TLR2 needs to heterodimerize with TLR1 (and not TLR6) in order for PorB to stimulate these APCs.  Utilizing this body of information, the next logical step for studying the immune stimulating adjuvant activity of PorB is to compare this activity to other known vaccine adjuvants. This will allow for the better use of PorB as adjuvant, by understanding what type of immune response it induces as compared to these other adjuvants. Moreover, we believe it is essential to continue to investigate the adjuvant potential of PorB, as it is currently the only TLR2 ligand being investigated as a vaccine adjuvant. We shall compare the immune stimulation by PorB to panel of other adjuvants, including the only licensed adjuvant, Alum (inflammasomes mediated immune activation, other TLR ligands, including CpG DNA (TLR9), and monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL)(TLR4), and QS-21. We shall examine the ability of these adjuvants to induce immune responses to a test antigen, ovalbumin, which we have used previously as described in the Preliminary Data section. We shall measure antibody levels induced, isotypes and IgG subtypes induced, antibody affinity, CD4 T cell response and ability to induce APC migration and lymph node specific T cell stimulation.  Moreover, we shall compare the ability of these different adjuvants to protect mice from infection with Listeria which secretes OVA. This is a well characterized model and has been used previously to demonstrate that the presence of OVA specific CD4 and CD8 T cells are necessary for protection of mice from infection with this pathogen when it is constructed to secrete OVA. We shall obtain this strain from Dr. Darren Higgins in the Dept. of Microbiology at the Harvard Medical School, who has significant expertise in this model and will act as a consultant on this proposal. Even though the protection induced by most licensed vaccines are due to the induction of neutralizing or functional antibodies, we feel it would extremely important to begin to definitively compare the ability of these adjuvants, including PorB, to not only induce functional antibodies, but to potentially induce a protective CD8 CTL response.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We have shown that the Neisserial porin, PorB, is a potent immune adjuvant and works via recognition by TLR2 and induction of antigen presenting cell activation. This proposal will examine the adjuvant activity of PorB and compare this activity to other currently investigated adjuvants (including Alum, CpG DNA, MPL and QS-21). We shall examine induction of both humoral responses and CD8 T cell responses and the ability of the vaccines to prevent Listeria infection in mice.

1R01ES022071-01,National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences,25,"The overall goal of the proposed work is to determine whether developmental or adult exposures to inorganic arsenic (iAs) increase prostate cancer (PCa) risk by reprogramming human prostate stem cells. Prior studies have revealed that environmental iAs exposure from natural sources (e.g. drinking water) increases PCa incidence. Recent findings also indicate that iAs directly alters stem cells and augments transformation and studies with PCa cell lines support that this may occur in the prostate gland. To further delineate  iAs action(s) in normal human prostate stem cells, determine windows of sensitivity for human exposures and link iAs stem cell exposures to PCa development, novel human prostate stem cell models have been established using primary epithelial cells from disease-free human prostates and human embryonic stem cells (hESC). Importantly, in vivo models using either hESC or adult prostate stem cells mixed with rat inductive mesenchyme have been produced to generate chimeric prostate tissues with normal human prostate epithelium. These original approaches are in place to directly address several unresolved issues regarding iAs exposures and stem cell reprogramming events and to potentially link iAs to growth of human PCa. To accomplish this three specific aims are proposed. Specific Aim 1: Delineate the effects of iAs in modulating normal human prostate and embryonic stem cell self-renewal and differentiation to epithelial cell lineages. To accomplish this, FACS and prostasphere assay of adult human prostate stem cells and directed differentiation of hESC in vitro will be utilized to interrogate te actions of a range of iAs doses in perturbing normal prostate development and growth. Specific Aim 2: Elucidate the molecular underpinnings of As reprogramming of prostate stem cells by identifying DNA methylation modifications and resultant changes in gene expression. In parallel with Specific Aim 1, analysis of prostasphere DNA methylome, DNA hydroxymethylome and transcriptome will be undertaken to identify genome-wide marks in stem cells with resultant As gene expression signatures. Specific Aim 3: Determine whether As exposure initiates carcinogenesis, acts as a co-carcinogen or promotes PCa progression in human prostate epithelium using novel in vivo chimeric prostate models. Adult prostate stem cells from normal men, PCa patients or hESC will be used to generate chimeric tissues grown as renal grafts in nude mice. Carcinogenesis in normal epithelium will be monitored after iAs exposures alone or with steroids as co-carcinogens. PCa progression will be examined in PCa stem cell-derived grafts exposed to iAs. Finally, aberrant expression of iAs-reprogrammed genes will be evaluated in tissue microarrays constructed from PCa patients for translational relevance. The present approaches using fresh human specimens with in vivo models combined with state-of-the-art epigenomic technologies are a marked advance over current approaches that will undoubtedly provide significant new and useful information pertaining to human prostate health. Together, these studies will generate novel information on how iAs increases PCa risk and provide a rationale framework for iAs exposure assessment.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Epidemiology studies have shown a strong positive association between levels of iAs in drinking water and prostate cancer incidence and mortality. The overall goal of the proposed studies is to determine whether early-life or adult As exposures increase prostate cancer risk by targeting human prostate stem cells which in turn contribute to prostate cancer onset and progression.",Effects Of Arsenic On Human Prostate Stem Cells And Prostate Cancer Risk,2012,2017,"Ho, Shuk-Mei Prins, Gail S ",University of Illinois At Chicago,Chicago,IL,17,1,-1,-1
5R01AI089700-02,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Disorders of iron metabolism, either genetically-determined or secondary to other illnesses, are relatively common cllinical problems. Our preliminary studies with Hfe knock-out (KO) mice, a model of human type I hemochromatosis (HH), have revealed that the abnormal iron metabolism in these animals is associated with attenuated inflammatory responses in vivo and in vitro. Individuals with type I HH, as well as Hfe KO mice, have abnormally low circulating levels of the hepatocyte-derived, iron-regulatory peptide hepcidin. As a result, there is a reduction of intra-macrophage iron concentrations accompanied by elevation of serum iron, with the latter leading to pathological deposition of the metal in various tissues. Our results indicate that the decrease of iron within macrophages impairs the ability of these cells to produce TNF1 and IL-6 in response to Gram- negative bacteria or LPS. The abnormality manifests in vivo as a reduction in the severity of Salmonella- induced enterocolitis. In additional studies with wild-type (WT) mice and with mouse models of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), we found that both infectious and non-infectious forms of colitis are associated with increased expression of hepcidin, and that blocking hepcidin expression reduces the severity of intestinal inflammation. Although increased hepcidin is a well known factor in the anemia of chronic inflammatory states, our experiments suggest that it also contributes to the pathogenesis of inflammation by increasing intra- macrophage iron levels and promoting the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Collectively, our observations indicate that changes in iron metabolism have a significant impact on the inflammatory response and, conversely, that inflammation is associated with alterations in iron metabolism that increase the production of inflammatory mediators. Elucidating the mechanisms responsible for this cross-talk will facilitate the development of anti-inflammatory strategies based on manipulating iron homeostasis. Therefore, we propose to (1) determine the mechanisms by which Hfe deficiency and the associated reduction in hepcidin expression and intra-macrophage iron attenuate intestinal inflammation, (2) elucidate the mechanisms that lead to the increased hepcidin expression and dysregulated iron metabolism that accompany intestinal inflammation, (3) evaluate the effect of a new strategy for inhibiting hepcidin expression on the severity of intestinal inflammation in mouse models of IBD.",Cross-Talk Between Iron Metabolism And Intestinal Inflammation,2011,2016,"Cherayil, Bobby Joseph",Massachusetts General Hospital,Boston,MA,26,1,106,4824
5R01AI093467-02,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Botulism is caused by exposure to toxins produced by Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT), a CDC Category A biodefense threat agent for which no antidote currently exists. Seven different BoNT serotypes have been discovered to date (BoNT/A-G), many having numerous additional BoNT subtypes. To protect against all of these diverse BoNT bioterror threats, expensive conventional small molecule drug development would need to be separately performed for each of the seven different drug targets and perhaps others. This challenge, together with other extreme hurdles confronting BoNT small molecule drug development, particularly complicates efforts to develop small molecule drugs to treat botulism. New therapeutic paradigms are urgently needed to counter the enormous risks associated with these easy to obtain, easy to produce and extremely dangerous bioterror agents. We have developed and then extensively optimized two distinct 'designer E3-ligase' agents that each accelerate the 'molecular cure' of neurons intoxicated by one of the two most dangerous Botulinum neurotoxins, serotypes A or B (BoNT/A, BoNT/B). These two lead agents consist of the F-box domain of TrCP fused to a camelid 'nanobody' domain with binding specificity for one of the BoNT proteases. These polypeptide agents, with a size less than 30 kDa, bind to the BoNT protease and cause its rapid, intraneuronal destruction leading to rapid recovery of the neuron. Because of the modular nature of this antidote, it will be simple and straightforward to develop similar agents to treat all other BoNT serotypes and subtypes simply by substituting the nanobody domains with another having the appropriate specificity. In this proposal, we will develop a general delivery vehicle to deliver our two lead agents to the cytosol of intoxicated neurons within botulism patients and perform pre-clinical evaluation. As the vehicle, we propose to use an atoxic Clostridial toxin-based neuronal delivery vehicle (TNDV) due to its highly evolved capability to enter the body, survive in serum and deliver enzyme activities to the cytosol of targeted cells. We will develop three different and proven TNDV systems, each having unique and compelling features, and then select the best vehicle(s) for further development and animal testing. The three TNDV systems will be modified, atoxic forms of: 1) BoNT serotype C; 2) C. difficile toxin B and; 3) Clostridial C2 toxin. If successful, it is expected that similar agents could be developed to target the accelerated turnover of virtually any cytosolic neuronal protein for research or therapeutic applications.       Public Health Relevance: Botulinum neurotoxin is an extremely dangerous, CDC Category A biodefense threat that is widely available, easily produced, exceedingly toxic and for which no antidote is available. Furthermore, at least seven different toxin types exist, each constituting of different drug targets and thus requiring distinct, challenging and expensive small molecule drug development programs. In contrast, the innovative new platform for biomolecule therapeutics that we propose to develop has the potential to quickly lead to commercially viable antidotes for all BoNT serotypes.",A Platform For Therapeutic Agents That Promote Rapid Recovery From Botulism,2011,2016,"Oyler, George A.shoemaker, Charles Bix ",Tufts University Boston,Boston,MA,26,1,-1,-1
1R21AI100168-01,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi and S. enterica serovars Paratyphi A and B, the causative agents of typhoid and paratyphoid fever, are important causes of morbidity and mortality in many countries with poor sanitation and water and food contaminated by human fecal waste. Non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) have long been known to be a cause of gastroenteritis and it is becoming increasingly recognized, both in the USA and globally, that multiple antibiotic-resistant strains are also emerging as important causes of invasive bacteremia and focal infections, resulting in hospitalizations and deaths. The current gold standard method for detection and identification of Salmonella spp. is bacterial culture which is time-consuming, laborious and often requires strains to be sent to a reference laboratory for serovar identification. There is a pressing need for a sensitive and specific rapid diagnostic test to detect Salmonella in blood, food and feces. This research proposal tests the hypothesis that the ultra-fast, highly sensitive microwave-accelerated metal-enhanced fluorescence (MAMEF) technology can be used to detect Salmonella spp. in less than 2 minutes. We aim to use this technology to detect any Salmonella and specifically the typhoidal serovars S. Typhi, S. Paratyphi A, and the non-typhoidal serovars S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis from blood, food, and feces. We anticipate that this approach will be much faster and more cost-effective than traditional microbiological methods. If successful, a future rapid diagnostic test will be useful in surveillance efforts to identify cases (due to typhoidal or non-typhoidal Salmonella), to refine the burden of invasive Salmonella disease (particularly in patients who previously received antibiotics) and in the food industry to identify food contaminated with Salmonella.

2R01AI083754-03,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"This proposed program can be considered as a competitive renewal of grant R01AI083754, titled Development of A Novel Strategy to Produce Antibacterial Glycoconjugate Vaccines, funded under ARRA from 7/30/2009 - 7/29/2011. The proposed work is aiming at solving an unmet biomedical need in the development of vaccines.  Development of antibacterial vaccines provides an attractive approach for fighting bacterial diseases. Surface-located Polysaccharides (PSs) of bacteria have great potentials to be used as vaccines for preventing bacterial infections. Although traditional chemical conjugation of polysaccharides with carrier proteins to make PS-protein conjugate vaccines has resulted in several highly successful glycoconjugate vaccines for the clinical use, it still suffers variable batch-to-batch composition, difficult quality control, inconsistent potency and high production cost. The fatal problem is that such approach does not produce a structurally well defined, pure chemical entity, which can be linked to its immunological activity in subsequent structural- activity relationship (SAR) investigation, as it is routinely done in modern drug discovery programs for small molecules. The discovery and further development of bacterial protein N- glycosylation system have provided a novel approach to solve this biomedical problem.  Oligosaccharyltransferase (PglB) from Campylobacter jejuni, which was first discovered by Markus Aebi in 2002, later developed by GlycoVaxyn LLC, was found to be able to transfer a variety of PS (from different bacteria) from its diphospho-undecaprenyl forms to the Asn of a consensus sequence of the target protein in the periplasm. Such synthetic biology approach fits well with our long-term efforts on studying the biosynthesis of microbial polysaccharides. Thus we have been developing this novel approach under ARRA R01AI083754. Our efforts resulted in a recent huge technique breakthrough after we worked out a facile method to clone any 20 to 30 kb polysaccharide biosynthesis gene clusters into an expression vector. Now structurally well-defined polysaccharide-protein bioconjugate can be produced by one-shot fermentation of recombinant E. coli K12 strain (incorporated with O-antigen gene cluster, pglB and carry protein gene acrA, each in one vector). For example, we recently produced 4.5 mg fully purified E. coli O157 O-antigen polysaccharide conjugated AcrA protein from simple E. coli fermentation. Such a bioconjugate already offers good possibility to be used to induce antibodies in cows or cattle to kill an inoculum of E. coli O157, since the vaccines can be produced in large scale economically.  Therefore, the program aims to produce a series of PS-protein bioconjugates and variants, as well as study the SAR of several important bioconjugate vaccines. Aim 1: Production of PS-protein bioconjugates: Two classes of bacterial infections will be attached. The first includes E. coli O157, O104 and Shigella sonnei; the second includes Staphylococcus aureus. Aim 2: Production of PS-protein variants Our bacterial protein N-glycosylation platform allow us to change the length of polysaccharides, the length of the carrier proteins, the density of PS on the carrier protein and fusion of any immunologically active peptide or protein to the carrier protein. Such PS-protein variants will be available for the first time for SAR investigatio. Aim 3: Immunological studies on PS-protein bioconjugates Collaborating with immunologist colleagues at GSU (many more national and international collaborators as the program unfolds), the immunological activities of PS-protein bioconjugates will be investigated with the goal of finding better protective vaccines than current conventional approaches can offer.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bacterial infections are one of the major health problems worldwide. With the increasing emergence of resistance towards major antibiotics, development of polysaccharide based vaccines provides an attractive approach for fighting the infectious diseases. Polysaccharides, forming a thick capsule that surrounds the bacterial pathogen, have been used as vaccines for preventing bacterial infections, and they were always linked to proteins to enhance their efficacy. The traditional chemical approach for producing such polysaccharide-protein linked vaccines suffers from complex production steps, low yields and impure products, thus leading to high costs of vaccines. The objective of this application is to develop a novel method for polysaccharide-protein linked vaccine production, by one-shot bacteria fermentation. With this method, we can obtain polysaccharide conjugate vaccines in a facile, efficient, and easily applicable manner. This method will firstly be explored with model pathogens. Then the established method can be easily applied to other pathogens.",Research And Development Of A Novel System To Produce Polysaccharide Conjugate Va,2009,2017,"Wang, Peng George",Georgia State University,Atlanta,GA,13,1,1426,3992
5R01AI087625-03,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"The obligate intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii is a major opportunistic pathogen of the AIDS epidemic. As it develops within host cells, the parasite implements a coordinated pattern of sequential gene expression. In response to stress and changes in its environment, the parasite completely alters its metabolism, surface antigens, and cell cycle to transition from tachyzoite to bradyzoite. Understanding how T. gondii regulates gene expression is fundamental for understanding the pathogenesis of toxoplasmosis. Epigenetic factors govern developmental transitions and expression of virulence traits, and are also implicated in T. gondii bradyzoite differentiation. How chromatin remodeling complexes interact with transcriptional machinery in T. gondii is not known. Recently, a plant-like transcription factor family, the APETELA 2 (or AP2) family, has been discovered and proposed as the primary transcription factors of T. gondii and other Apicomplexa. We hypothesize that conserved Apicomplexa AP2 family members have conserved functions in T. gondii as sequence-specific transcription factors that interact with general transcription factors and chromatin remodeling complexes to regulate gene expression. We have previously developed a epigenomic map of tachyzoites that defines functional regions of the genome. We will use this prior work to assist us in determining the genes regulated by TgAP2. The DNA binding specificity of AP2 proteins will be identified using a multidisciplinary approach. Proteins that interact with TgAP2 will be identified using proteomics. These studies will form a scaffold upon which we will build systems biology model to understand how gene networks govern biologically significant events such as bradyzoite formation.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Toxoplasma gondii is a parasitic pathogen that causes severe disease in immunocompromised individuals including people with AIDS. This parasite undergoes a carefully orchestrated developmental program within infected cells and also can respond to changes in its environment by changing into persistent, hardier bradyzoite forms. These transitions involve tight coordination of gene expression. Recently we have begun to characterize newly discovered T. gondii genes that appear to regulate gene expression. These genes, the AP2 family, may be new drug targets because they resemble plant genes rather than genes seen in mammals. The genes are also conserved in many other apicomplexan organisms that affect AIDS patients such as Cryptosporidium. Understanding the function of AP2 proteins may lead to new treatments that will prevent of treat T. gondii infection in individuals with AIDS.",Toxoplasma Epigenomics And Gene Expression,2010,2015,"Kim, Kami ",Albert Einstein College of Medicine,Bronx,NY,37,1,1411,1232

S. aureus superantigens are associated with food-borne illnesses, pulmonary disease, pneumonia, toxic shock syndrome, exacerbated atopic dermatitis, delayed wound healing, and infectious endocarditis. The objective of the proposed work is to use high-affinity probes against these toxins, engineered by ImmuVen, to develop ultrasensitive detection assays. The probes include soluble T cell receptor proteins (IMV01, IMV02, IMV03, and IMV04) engineered for very high-affinity binding to Staphylococcal enterotoxins SEB, SEC, TSST-1, and SEA, respectively. It is thought that there are about 185,000 cases of Staphylococcal food-borne illness in the United States, annually, resulting in around 1750 hospitalizations with a cost of $1.5 billion. The  hypotheses of this Phase I application are that ImmuVen can develop a high affinity Vbeta protein that will bind SEA, the most important superantigen involved in Staphylococcal food-borne illness, and that this protein and the other already characterized soluble proteins can be used to develop a rapid multiplex assay for the detection of these Staphylococcal superantigens. The work will be performed in collaboration with Prof. David Kranz (University of Illinois), and Drs. Sandra Tallent and Jeffrey DeGrasse at the FDA.

1R21AI102254-01,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Apicomplexa are important pathogens that include the causative agents of malaria, toxoplasmosis, and cryptosporidiosis. Toxoplasma gondii is the causative agent of human toxoplasmosis, a systemic infection acquired mostly through contaminated water and vegetables, or uncooked meat. Tissue cyst formation occurs soon after infection and is responsible for lifelong infection in immunocompetent individuals. At least one-third of the World's population and about 22.5% of Americans are seropositive for toxoplasmosis, making it one of the most prevalent infections in the United States. T. gondii resides intracellularly within parasitophorous vacuoles, and reactivation and dissemination of infection to different organs may occur following immune suppression. Cryptosporidium parvum is responsible for significant disease burden among children in developing countries and it can result in chronic and life-threatening enteritis in AIDS patients. The present chemotherapy available against T. gondii chronic infection and cryptosporidiosis is not effective and new drugs are urgently needed to treat both infections.  T. gondii lacks a mevalonate pathway for the synthesis of isoprenoid precursors but harbor a 1-deoxy-D- xylulose-5-phosphate (DOXP) pathway in its apicoplast. This pathway generates isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethyallyl diphosphate (DMAPP), which are condensed by the action of a unique farnesyl diphosphate synthase (TgFPPS) into farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP). Our preliminary data have indicated that the DOXP pathway is essential for T. gondii survival in its host. Surprisingly, though, drugs acting on the mevalonate pathway, like statins, are active in vitro and in vivo against the parasite. These results indicate that the  parasite needs to synthesize some isoprenoid precursors (IPP, DMAPP), while salvaging others (FPP, GGPP) from its host. We will exploit this to develop a double hit strategy. Remarkably the model suggests that Cryptosporidium parvum should be highly susceptible to this approach.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Our goal is to find ways of interfering with Toxoplasma gondii metabolic pathways as a strategy for controlling infections caused by this and similar parasites. We have identified that the isoprenoid pathway is essential for T. gondii. The parasite synthesizes isoprenoid intermediates and takes up some from its host. Based on our results, we propose a strategy of combining inhibitors of both host and parasite isoprenoid pathways. In the second phase of the project we will adapt this strategy to dormant stages of T. gondii, and to other parasites such as Cryptosporidium.",Targeting Host And Apicomplexan Isoprenoid Pathways,2012,2014,"Moreno, Silvia N",University of Georgia,Athens,GA,13,1,182,1564

This parasite is estimated to infect approximately one quarter of the world's human population and is capable of causing severe neurologic consequences and death in congenital infections or when reactivated in immunocompromised patients. Human infections result from ingestion of the environmentally resistant oocysts, through ingestion of undercooked meat from an intermediate host (e.g. swine, cattle, sheep) containing bradyzoite tissue cysts, or through congenital transmission. Recent evidence indicates that human infection through oocysts in water, soil or vegetables is a significant source of human infections and several waterborne outbreaks of toxoplasmosis have been reported globally. The oocyst stage is capable of persisting in the environment for years, remaining infective to humans and animals at an infectious dose as low as 1-10 oocysts. Domestic and wild felids are the only known definitive host in which sexual replication of the parasite occurs, resulting in excretion of oocysts in feces. A single cat may shed as many as 1 billion oocysts following a primary infection. Oocysts are resistant to methods used to disinfect water, including chlorination, UV irradiation and ozonation at levels well in excess of those used to treat both waste-water and sewage. The robustness of the oocyst is thought to come from the biochemical and structural properties of its bilayered oocyst wall. Yet, very little is known about the composition of the layers of the oocyst wall. The goal of this research plan is to describe the composition of the oocyst wall using the highly complementary proteomic and transcriptomic characterization of the oocyst wall to identify key proteins that confer properties of resistance.

5R01AI089885-02,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Apicomplexan parasites are important pathogens of humans that cause diseases with widespread impacts on global health. The life cycles of these obligate intracellular parasites are complex, involving multiple proliferative and non-growing stages that ensure successful parasite transmission. Pathogenesis, virulence, and disease severity are critically influenced by asexual stage growth rates that can lead to increased parasite biomass and significant tissue destruction and inflammation. Consequently, mechanisms controlling parasite growth rate are important to virulence. Building new daughter parasites requires tight control over the delivery of protein products, and in Plasmodium and Toxoplasma a cascade of >2800 mRNAs serially unfolds during each division cycle. Transcription in apicomplexa pathogens is poorly understood, however, the recent discovery of plant-like transcription factors in the Apicomplexa has uncovered an important set of factors that may control cell cycle transcription in these parasites. Nearly a third of all Toxoplasma AP2 genes are periodically expressed during tachyzoite replication with a timing distributed across the division cycle. We hypothesize that these factors are responsible for the just-in-time delivery of gene products required to build new parasites. Through their binding to specific promoter DNA sequence, TgAP2 factors regulate cell cycle transcription, and thereby influence the efficiency and fidelity of Toxoplasma replication. In this proposal, we will characterize the role of TgAP2 factors in the parasite cell cycle by determining the precise order of expression for key cell cycle TgAP2 proteins, by discovering the promoters they regulate through whole-genome protein binding studies, and by validating the in vivo function of these proteins in parasite replication through the generation of loss and mis- expression mutants. These studies will provide fundamental knowledge of a new set of mechanisms required to produce parasite replication that is relevant to acute disease caused by the growth of Toxoplasma in the immunocompromised human host.",The AP2 Factors Required For Toxoplasma Replication,2011,2016,"White, Michael W",University of South Florida,Tampa,FL,12,1,988,1566

Arsenic in drinking water is a major concern for US populations who live in small rural communities. Prospective evidence and mechanisms for arsenic related diabetes must be investigated. Objective: To evaluate the role of inorganic arsenic exposure and metabolism and gene-arsenic interactions in the development of diabetes, insulin resistance, ? cell dysfunction and the metabolic syndrome among 2,717 Strong Heart Family Study (SHFS) participants e18 year old who were free of diabetes at baseline. Preliminary studies: We have identified an association between urine arsenic concentrations and the prevalence of diabetes in American Indians 45-74 year old from Arizona, Oklahoma and the Dakotas who participated in the Strong Heart Study (SHS). Urine arsenic concentrations and methylation excretion patterns remained constant over a 10-year follow-up. The heritability of the proportion of monomethylarsonate (%MMA) in urine was 0.52. In a small linkage study, we detected potential quantitative trait loci associated with %MMA in areas of the genome close to methyltransferase genes. Design and setting: The SHFS is a population- based prospective family study that recruited parents, spouses, offspring, spouses of offspring and grandchildren of SHS participants in 1998-2005. Demographic, lifestyle and medical information and measures of fasting glucose and insulin, lipid profile, hypertension endpoints, body mass index, and waist and hip circumferences are available at baseline and follow-up visits through 2011. Urine samples and blood DNA samples were stored at -70oC. Exposure assessment: We will measure total urine arsenic and urine arsenic species concentrations using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICPMS) and high performance liquid chromatography-ICPMS (HPLC-ICPMS), respectively. Genetic assessment: We will prioritize and measure ~1,500 SNPs in candidate genes related to arsenic metabolism and toxicity using a multiplex panel. We will measure SNPs in candidate genes related to diabetes traits using the Metabo-chip, a highly cost- effective candidate gene chip for diabetes and cardiometabolic traits. Statistical analysis: We will use mixed- effect models for binary and linear outcomes to assess the prospective association of urine arsenic species concentrations at baseline with the incidence of diabetes and the metabolic syndrome and changes in the homeostatic model assessment to quantify insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and ? cell dysfunction (HOMA-B) over time. Gene-arsenic interaction will be estimated using principle component analysis and accounting for population stratification using genomic control. Significance: By investigating the contribution of inorganic arsenic to diabetes, insulin resistance, ? cell dysfunction and the metabolic syndrome and by identifying genetic susceptibility factors, this study can inform the arsenic-diabetes relationship and impact the prevention and control of arsenic exposure in drinking water and food in the US and abroad.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Increasing evidence supports the role of arsenic exposure in the development of diabetes. This study will evaluate the role of arsenic exposure and metabolism and their interaction with genetic markers in the development of diabetes in American Indian communities.

5P42ES007373-18,National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences,25,"This project aims to study the genetic control of arsenic (As) homeostasis in plants. This will enable the development of plants that can selectively exclude As from their tissues, preventing As accumulation in food crops and reducing human dietary intake of As. Arsenic is one of the primary metal(loid)s of concern at Superfund Sites and chronic low-dose exposure is linked to an increased incidence of bladder cancer. Dietary studies of As intake in humans show that after drinking water, white rice is the most significant source of inorganic As for humans. A market basket survey found higher As concentrations in U.S. grown rice than rice grown in the As-affected regions of the Bengal Delta. In U.S. rice, As is thought to have come from arsenical pesticides used in the production of cotton, but As input to soil comes from a variety of industrial sources. We aim to use Arabidopsis, rice and the As-hyperaccumulating brake fern as model plant systems. They represent two species with a completed genomic sequence; one of the most important staple food crops plants and an important dietary source of inorganic As for humans, and one of the few plant species with intrinsic As resistance. We propose to use an interdisciplinary approach that combines ionomic survey techniques, quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping and spatially resolved metal(loid) analysis and speciation via synchrotron x-ray microprobe (SXRM). The research strategy consists of gene discovery and gene characterization phases. For gene discovery, approaches include mining an existing dataset of elemental profiles of 4,000 yeast and 62,000 Arabidopsis samples for those with altered As phenotypes as well as examining natural accessions of Arabdiospis for differences in As accumulation. We will use highthroughput elemental analysis and DMA microarray-based mapping to identify genes that regulate As accumulation in rice, screening 1,790 rice accessions with the USDA's Rice Core Collection and examining QTLs for As in the Lemont X Teqing mapping population. We will use SXRM to investigate changes in the micron-scale metal(loid) distribution, abundance and/or speciation in plant tissue resulting from the deletion or silencing of selected genes of interest. This technique allowed successful characterization of gene function in a recent study of iron homeostasis. An important product of the gene characterization phase will be the online publication of an Elemental Atlas of Arabidopsis available to the wider scientific community.This proposed research expands the application of x-ray techniques beyond a spatially-resolved analytical technique into a tool for functionally characterizing ion homeostasis genes, as well as protecting human food supplies.","Project 9: Arsenic Uptake, Transport And Accumulation In Plants",,2014,"Guerinot, Mary Lou ",Dartmouth College,Hanover,NH,34,1,72,2899

5R01AI050617-10,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Project Summary/Abstract The long-term objective of this application is to understand the molecular pathogenesis of infection with the intracellular protozoan Toxoplasma gondii. The parasite is an important pathogen in immunosuppressed populations and is classified by the NIAID as a category B biodefense organism. Nevertheless, in most cases infection with this widespread parasite is asymptomatic. Host survival during infection requires robust Type 1 cytokine production, yet overly exuberant responses can result in host pathology and death. Thus, both parasite and host benefit from regulated proinflammatory cytokine responses. The underlying hypothesis to be tested is that T. gondii possesses molecular mechanisms to subvert host signaling pathways leading to proinflammatory cytokine production. Recent work has revealed the ability of Toxoplasma to down-regulate cytokines such as TNF-? from within infected cells. Increasing evidence indicates this is achieved through sophisticated manipulation of host intracellular signaling cascades. The goal of this proposal is to elucidate mechanisms by which Toxoplasma subverts proinflammatory signaling cascades in the innate immune system, in particular within cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells that are targeted for in vivo infection. Cellular and biochemical methods will be employed to define the points at which Toxoplasma interferes with host signal transduction. In this regard, parasite-induced activation of signaling molecule STAT3, known to be involved in down-regulation of proinflammatory cytokines IL-12 and TNF-?, will be examined. The nature of TNF-? suppression in infected macrophages is profound. Therefore, we will employ molecular methods to determine how the parasite influences promoter activity of the TNF-? gene. The last part of this proposal will focus effort on examining if parasite-infected macrophages and dendritic cells display a suppression phenotype during in vivo mouse infections. This will be accomplished using cellular and immunological methods to determine IL-12 and TNF-? production in infected cells in vivo and their in vivo ability to respond to defined Toll-like receptor ? ligands. In addition, macrophage and dendritic cell expression of cell surface activation markers will be analyzed. From these studies, we expect to gain important information on how T. gondii interacts with the host innate immune system, allowing a deeper understanding of infection with this important opportunistic pathogen. PROJECT NARRATIVE / RELEVANCE The relevance of the project to public health is that Toxoplasma infects between 30-80% of the human population worldwide. While normally an asymptomatic infection, with suboptimal immune function the parasite emerges as a devastating and sometimes lethal infection.

2R01AI072661-06A1,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Vibrio cholerae causes the fatal epidemic diarrheal disease cholera. The expression of its primary virulence factors, toxin-coregulated pilus and cholera toxin, occurs via a transcriptional cascade involving several activator proteins and serves as a paradigm for the regulation of bacterial virulence. AphA and AphB initiate the expression of the cascade by a novel interaction at the tcpPH promoter. AphA is a member of a new regulator family and AphB is a LysR-type activator, one of the largest transcriptional regulatory families. Once expressed, cooperation between TcpP/TcpH and the homologous transmembrane activators ToxR/ToxS activates the toxT promoter. ToxT, an AraC-type regulator, then directly activates the promoters of the primary virulence factors in a fatty acid dependent manner. Transcriptional activation at these various promoters occurs only in response to certain environmental stimuli. One such stimulus, cell density, influences the virulence cascade through the quorum sensing system regulator HapR which represses the expression of the aphA promoter. The long term goals of this proposal are to understand the molecular basis of virulence gene regulation so as to facilitate the development of better strategies to prevent and cure bacterial diseases. Achieving these goals requires an understanding of how the specific regulatory proteins function at their promoters to control gene expression and, ultimately, how they are influenced by environmental stimuli. Through a collaborative effort involving laboratories with expertise in structural biology, virulence gene regulation, and pathogenesis, we have solved crystal structures of AphA, AphB, HapR, and ToxT. This proposal will build upon this structural data, as well as our functional results, in ordr to continue to elucidate the detailed mechanisms required for regulation of the V. cholerae virulence genes. In Aim 1, we propose to determine the crystal structures of AphA, AphB, and HapR in complex with their respective DNA binding sites, allowing us to observe the structural changes that take place upon DNA binding. In Aim 2, we plan to characterize the ligand binding pockets of AphB and HapR. As the natural ligands for these proteins are not known, we plan to identify small molecule ligands for HapR and AphB, and then visualize the structural changes induced in the proteins by ligand binding. Aim 3 carries on our investigation of the mechanism by which fatty acid binding regulates the activity of ToxT, the master regulator of virulence gene expression in V. cholerae. In addition to crystallography, we will utilize structure based site directed mutagenesis, biochemical activity assays, biophysical characterization assays, spectroscopic characterization of binding and conformational change, and computational and NMR based methods for identifying ligands. These studies will greatly clarify the mechanistic and structural roles of proteins involved in the regulation of bacterial virulence gene expression.  Such knowledge will facilitate the identification of molecules interfering with regulatory cascades, and could lead to the development of novel therapeutics.

Presently, it is reported in approximately 52 countries worldwide. During our first study, we carried out biweekly clinical and environmental surveillance in four rural areas of Bangladesh. Analysis of our accumulated clinical and environmental data identified factors that are significantly predictive for occurrence of cholera outbreaks, including water temperature, pH, and conductivity of surface water, along with concentrations of plankton and cholera toxin- producing bacteria in surface waters. A significant finding was that zooplankton, namely copepods, serve as an effective host for V. cholerae. By tracking their phytoplankton food source, using satellite monitoring of chlorophyll a concentration, it is possible to estimate zooplankton populations.  With our successes to date, we will conduct epidemiological and ecological surveillance in Chattak and Mathbaria, two widely separated geographical sites, where we have documented predictable seasonal cholera outbreaks: one in the spring and the other in the fall. Using improved assays, we will enumerate multiple morphologies and life stages of V. cholerae in environmental samples, including the viable but nonculturable form (VBNC). Characterization of genetic associations between clinical and environmental isolates and GIS surveillance will be conducted to establish key epidemiological relationships that have been difficult to document at the genomic level.  To elucidate local variability in cholera outbreaks, we will investigate factors recognized from our previous study, as well as those identified by other investigators, but not yet included in our predictive model, namely microbial community dynamics, increased competence of V. cholerae attached to chitinous surfaces, and plankton community dynamics. Using environmental variables identified from our previous studies and incorporating the new variables that prove to be correlated with cholera cases, we will refine our model of cholera transmission with the intent to render it useful for predicting cholera outbreaks, thereby allowing early mobilization of preventative and treatment measures. The very recent availability of inexpensive oral cholera vaccines makes this objective even more relevant.

Airway inflammation in  asthma results from an allergic-type reaction to an inhaled antigen (allergen) from the environment. It is now  clear that this reaction is primarily orchestrated by CD4[+] MHC class II restricted T cells that recognize and  become activated by specific allergens via their T cell receptor. The asthma phenotype is thought to be  primarily driven by Th2-type CD4[+] T cells; however, other CD4[+] T cell subsets, such as Th1 cells, Th17 cells  and regulatory T cells (Tregs) have also been implicated in asthma pathogenesis. In this proposal, we will  use MHC class II tetramers to specifically identify and study allergen-specific T cells recovered from the  airways and blood following endobronchial segmental allergen challenge (SAC) in human subjects. We will  compare the numbers, phenotype and function of effector and regularoty T cells recovered from two groups  of allergic subjects: allergic asthmatics (AA) and allergic non-asthmatics (ANA). For unclear reasons, ANA  subjects have symptomatic allergic inflammation to common aeroallergens in the skin, nose and/or eyes, but  do not have symptoms of asthma. We hypothesize that there are fundamental differences in the T cell  response in the lung to allergens in AA when compared to ANA subjects that account for the difference in the  clinical response. In this project we will correlate the phenotypic and functioanl differences in T cell subtypes  in these subjects to changes in airway physiology following SAC utilizing novel and innovative PET-CT  imaging techniques.

There are likely many reasons for this difference but unambiguous evidence from animal studies and recent data from clinical studies in humans indicate that strain differences in the parasite likely play a major rol. Genetic studies of the parasite have led to the identification of a small number of genes that differ between strains and that interface with the innate immune system in dramatically different ways. The on-going goals of this work are to identify these proteins and determine the molecular basis for their strain-specific effects.  In the prior funding period, it was discovered that the recruitment of host mitochondria to the parasitophorous vacuole is a strain-specific phenomenon and the gene responsible for this difference, mitochondrial-association factor 1 or MAF1, was identified. The first aim of the current proposal is to determine how MAF1 recruits mitochondria, the precise nature of the strain-specific differences in its action and the downstream consequences in terms of interactions with the host. Mitochondria are being increasingly recognized as key to innate immune functions and so these differences are likely to play out in important ways in pathogenesis.  Macrophages are key players in some of the earliest immune responses and progress in the first funding period revealed a role for several polymorphic Toxoplasma genes in mediating the response of these cells. The second aim of the current proposal is to identify the genes responsible for two of these strain-specific differences and determine the molecular basis for the downstream effects that are observed.

5R01AI055987-09,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Vibrio cholerae causes the disease cholera and is a natural inhabitant of aquatic environments. Seasonal cholera outbreaks occur where the disease is endemic and can spread worldwide. V. cholerae's ability to cause epidemics is tied to its ability to survive in aquatic habitats. It has been proposed that V. cholerae's ability to form biofilms (i.e., matrix-enclosed, surface-associated communities) is crucial for its survival in aquatic habitats between epidemics and is advantageous for host-to-host transmission during epidemics. The objective of this proposal is to improve our understanding of biofilm matrix components, the mechanisms and regulation of biofilm formation, the mechanism of cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c- diGMP) signaling, and their importance in the biology of V. cholerae.  In Aim 1, we will focus on characterization of biofilm matrix components. We will determine Vibrio polysaccharide (VPS) binding capacities and localization patterns of the matrix proteins in biofilms, and test our hypothesis that these proteins bind to VPS in order to stabilize the matrix. We will determine which genes within the vps gene clusters are required for biofilm formation. We will also investigate the enzymatic properties of a putative VPS lyase. Finally, we will ascertain the contribution of known biofilm determinants in V. cholerae pathogenesis. In Aim 2, we will dissect regulation of biofilm formation. Biofilm regulatory network consists of two positive transcriptional regulators (VpsR and VpsT), a negative transcriptional regulator (HapR), and our recently-identified sensor histidine kinase (VpsS). We will determine whether VpsS phoshorylates VpsR and identify important signals that control VpsS. We will characterize the cis-acting features of the vps and matrix-protein genes and elucidate whether the transcriptional regulators VpsR, VpsT and HapR interact directly with these promoters. In Aim 3, we will elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which c-diGMP signaling controls biofilm formation. We will determine whether c-diGMP signaling proteins that modulate biofilm formation rely on protein-protein interactions. To identify the target proteins of the c-di-GMP signaling systems, we will search for proteins interacting with c-diGMP signaling proteins, as well as for c-diGMP receptor proteins within the rugose variants. We will then assess how these c-diGMP signaling proteins affect V. cholerae pathogenesis.  Better understanding of the mechanism of biofilm formation, c-diGMP signaling, and the importance of both of these processes in V. cholerae biology will prove useful for the development of future strategies for predicting and controlling cholera epidemics, and will facilitate identification of novel drug targets for combating the pathogen during infection.",Smooth To Rugose Phase Variation In Vibrio Cholerae,2003,2013,"Yildiz, Havva Fitnat",University of California Santa Cruz,Santa Cruz,CA,6,1,-1,5726
5R01AI064721-08,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Pore-forming cytolysins are produced by virtually all genera of pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria. The most widely distributed group is the CDC family of which Streptolysin O (SLO) is a prominent member. SLO is produced by Streptococcus pyogenes, an important cause of pharyngitis and other serious diseases including scarlet fever, rheumatic fever and necrotizing faciitis. However, how SLO acts to promote the pathogenesis of any of these diseases is not well-understood. In this project, we have found that SLO plays a central role in the Cytolysin-Mediated Translocation (CMT) pathway, a novel pathway that acts to translocate the S. pyogenes NAD-glycohydrolase (SPN) across the host cell membrane and into its cytosol. CMT likely makes an important contribution to pathogenesis as cytosolic SPN is cytotoxic for cultured cells. However, how SLO functions to translocate SPN, and how SPN contributes to cytotoxicity is not clearly understood. CMT is a polarized process in which the majority of the exported SPN is destined for the host cell cytosol, and is not released into the extracellular milieu. Also, CMT requires specific domains in SLO and SPN that are absolutely required for translocation, but not for pore-formation or glycohydrolase activity. We have also recently found that SLO pore-formation itself is completely dispensable for CMT. Thus, how SLO and SPN interact with the membrane and each other and how this results in polarized translocation is not clear. In addition, our recent data suggest that glycohydrolase activity may not serve as the only or most important basis of SPN's cytotoxic effect as variants of SPN that lack glycohydrolase activity are still cytotoxic and that cytotoxicity requires concomitant formation of the SLO pore. The present study will investigate the mechanism of translocation and cytotoxicity and will be furthered by our recent determination of the SPN crystal structure and our detailed kinetic analysis of SPN enzymology. Specific questions to be addressed include an analysis of a predicted glycan-binding domain in SPN, the role of SLO-membrane interactions in SPN uptake, the basis for the glycohydrolase-independent cytotoxicity and how the various activities of both SLO and SPN interact to promote toxicity and to modulate host cell signaling. Further analysis of CMT will reveal details of a novel pathway for effector translocation and how different toxins synergize to modulate host cell behavior to produce specific pathogenic outcomes.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cytolysin-mediated translocation (CMT) is a novel pathway for toxin delivery in the Gram-positive pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes that uses the pore-forming cytolysin Streptolysin O (SLO) to translocate the streptococcal NAD+ glycohydrolase (SPN) across the host cell membrane and into its cytosol. Both SLO and cytosolic SPN then act to cause host cell death. In this project we will exploit our recent observations that pore-formation and glycohydrolase activity are dispensable for CMT and toxicity, respectively, along with our determination of the crystal structure of SPN to produce mutants of SPN and SLO that will be used to elucidate how SLO acts to translocate SPN. We will also use these mutants to investigate how SLO and SPN interact to both kill and manipulate the cytokine signaling responses of cells. This information will be important for understanding how the multiple toxins of S. pyogenes interact with each other and with host cells to unravel how this pathogen can cause such a diverse range of different diseases.",CYTOLYSIN-MEDIATED TRANSLOCATION IN S.

5R01AI024656-22,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Shigella is the causative agent of bacillary dysentery in humans and primates. Over 200 million cases are reported annually and about 650,000 persons die of shigellosis each year. No effective vaccine exists. Recent bioterrorism concerns increase the importance of understanding Shigella pathogenesis since Shigella has been classified as a category B agent on the NIAID's list of priority pathogens for biodefense research. Shigella is a classic example of an invasive, facultative intracellular pathogen that is exquisitely adapted to living within the cytoplasm of the host cell. Moreover, Shigella has evolved mechanisms to replicate within and exit the host while avoiding the host inflammatory response. Our long term objectives have focused on post-invasion aspects of Shigella pathogenesis including molecular characterization of secreted effector proteins and their role in modulating the host immune response and facilitating intracellular bacterial growth and survival. The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) Characterize the bacterial and host factors responsible for the anti-apoptotic effects of Shigella flexneri infection in epithelial cells; and 2) Characterize the role of the Osp proteins with respect to Shigella pathogenesis and the host immune response. Several models and innovative experimental strategies for testing them are proposed. Genetic, biochemical and molecular and cell biology approaches will be utilized in all aims. This research will fill in important gaps in our knowledge of Shigella pathogenesis. Information on how secreted effectors of Shigella modulate host cell survival (anti- apoptosis) and the host inflammatory response can reveal new targets for the design of therapeutic agents. The results of the proposed studies can serve as a paradigm for understanding similar phenotypic traits of other intracellular bacterial pathogens. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bacillary dysentery (shigellosis) is an acute diarrheal disease caused by bacteria of the Shigella species. Because shigellosis is easily spread from person to person and ingestion of just a few organisms in contaminated food or water is sufficient to cause disease, Shigella are classified as category B biological agents.

5R01ES003358-26,National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences,25,"The trichothecenes, a group of sesquiterpenoid mycotoxins commonly encountered as food contaminants worldwide, have been etiologically linked to human and animal illnesses with the immune system being a major target. In experimental animals, these mycotoxins and other natural toxins that bind with high affinity to eukaryotic ribosomes (eg. ricin, Shiga toxin, anisomycin) induce proinflammatory gene expression and apoptosis in lymphoid tissues. Because of their potential for use in chemical terrorism, trichothecenes and other ribotoxins are now included on the CDC Select Agents list. Although ribosome-directed agents are known to exert toxicity by activating mitogen-activated protein kinases, the underlying mechanisms for this ribotoxic stress response (RSR) remain largely undefined. Thus, a critical gap exists in our knowledge of the signal transduction mechanisms by which ribotoxins modulate gene expression and apoptosis. The objective of this proposal is to test the guiding hypothesis that the ribosome plays a central role in the initiation and integration of protein kinase-mediated stress responses to trichothecenes and other ribotoxic agents. This hypothesis is based on observations in the macrophage that: 1)deoxynivalenol (DON), a common foodborne trichothecene, mediates cleavage of 18S and 28S ribosomal (r)RNA, 2) double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR), a ribosome-associated serine-threonine kinase, is essential for DON-induced protein kinase activation and 3) DON induces mobilization of several protein kinases to the ribosome whereupon they are phosphorylated. To test our hypothesis, three Specific Aims are proposed. In Aim 1, we will characterize DON-induced rRNA cleavage relative to targets, kinetics and mechanisms in the macrophage. In Aim 2, we will use both macrophage and cell-free models to characterize the role of PKR as an early sensor of DON-induced rRNA damage. In Aim 3, we will track DON-induced changes in ribosome-associated proteins in the macrophage relative to composition, kinetics and kinase activites. From these studies, we expect to understand how the ribosome mediates the induction and integration of multiple intracellular signaling cascades that drive altered gene expression and apoptosis in mononuclear phagocytes in response to ribotoxic agents. Anticipated outcomes include: 1) improved understanding of the molecular basis by which trichothecenes and other ribotoxins disrupt immunity, 2) enhanced capacity to assess and manage risks associated with exposure to trichothecenes and other ribotoxins, and 3) mechanism-based strategies for preventing and/or treating persons exposed to trichothecenes and ribotoxic chemicals via natural contamination or chemical terrorism. Collectively, these outcomes will positively impact public health by providing a scientific basis for generating sound recommendations relative to this important class of toxins and appropriate remedial actions should exposure occur. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to learn how a class of potent biological toxins interferes with the function and survival of cells that are essential to the immune system.

5R01AI074958-05,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Intracellular microbial recognition plays a critical role in innate immunity. Small fragments of bacterial peptidoglycan as well as bacterial flagellin are known to stimulate the NOD-like Receptors in mammals. This family of receptors includes both the NOD proteins, which respond to peptidoglycan fragments by activating NF-?B, and the NALP family of proteins, which respond to peptidoglycan, flagellin and other danger signals by activating IL-12 processing and release. Animals deficient in these receptors are hypersusceptible to infection, while humans carrying mutations in NOD2 and NALP3 suffer from autoinflammatory Crohn's disease and Muckle Wells Syndrome. Despite advances, it has not yet been demonstrated that any of these putative intracellular innate immune receptors directly recognize their cognate ligand, nor is it clear how these intracellular receptor transduce signals or how the induced responses contribute to efficient immune protection. In Drosophila, we have recently established that analogous intracellular microbial recognition occurs. Upon injection into flies, small fragments of peptidoglycan are recognized by the intracellular receptor PGRP-LE. Moreover, PGRP-LE directly binds these monomeric fragments of peptidoglycan causing receptor oligomerization. In addition to small fragments of peptidoglycan, PGRP-LE also recognizes cytosolic bacteria, like Listeria monocytogenes, and this recognition is critical to block bacterial growth. These results have led us to hypothesize that PGRP-LE functions as an intracellular receptor capable of recognizing peptidoglycan that enters cells, triggering receptor oligomerization, intracellular signaling and ultimately protective immune responses. We propose a series of 3 Aims that will probe in molecular detail the role of PGRP-LE and intracellular bacterial recognition in producing effective immune responses. Aim 1 will determine which organs, cells and subcellular compartments are involved in the PGRP-LE-mediated response to monomeric peptidoglycan. Aim 2 will characterize the molecular mechanisms of PGRP-LE-mediated signal transduction. The function of ligand-induced receptor oligomerization will be analyzed in vivo; the different responses emanating from intracellular versus cell-surface immune recognition will be probed; and a direct feedback inhibitor of these peptidoglycan binding receptors will be characterized. Aim 3 will analyze the role of PGRP-LE in the response to pathogens that release large quantities of monomeric peptidoglycan. And the role of PGRP-LE in controlling infection by intracellular Listeria monocytogenes will be thoroughly characterized. Autophagy is critical for the control of Listeria and we will determine if PGRP-LE- mediated recognition is required for the induction of this protective response. In people, the innate immune response is absolutely critical for the rapid protection against germs and for the effectiveness of vaccines. In addition, uncontrolled innate immune reactions are often the root cause of auto-inflammatory diseases. Insects, such as the fruit fly, rely entirely on innate immune responses that are very similar to our own innate immune system, and this proposal aims to use the fruit fly, a powerful experimental system, for the study of innate immunity.

5K08AI089982-02,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Pediatric FA affects 6-8% of children, in whom it is the major risk factor for anaphylaxis and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). The pathogenetic mechanisms leading up to food sensitization and target organ inflammation are poorly understood. A better understanding of FA pathogenesis will be essential to the development of specific diagnostic and therapeutic tools to combat these widespread diseases. The proposed work represents an entirely new line of inquiry into FA pathogenesis. Building on novel preliminary (included in a manuscript favorably reviewed by JACI) which demonstrate that invariant Natural Killer T cells (iNKTs) are 1) stimulated by milk derived lipids to secrete Th2-specific cytokines, and 3) are qualitatively and quantitatively different in children with FA (IgE mediated milk allergy or active EoE) than in their healthy or in remission counterparts, the proposed work will define the role of iNKTs in FA development and expand our understanding of how milk-SL (milk-sphingolipids) specifically activate iNKTs to induce FA. Specifically, I hypothesize that: 1) iNKTs are sequestered at the site of the allergic inflammation in FA children; 2) iNKTs stimulated by food-SL promote chronic inflammation via macrophage activation 3) Milk-SL activate iNKTs in a CD1d-restricted fashion using specific TCR rearrangements. To test these hypotheses, I will study iNKTs in children with EoE, for whom I have access to both PB and esophageal biopsy samples. In tandem, I will perform mechanistic studies using adult iNKTs, which afford the large number of cells necessary for such studies. Given the novel results reported in my preliminary data, I believe that the proposed research will revolutionize our understanding of food's influence on the immune system, and provide a new paradigm for food sensitization in which the lipid content of food, not just its protein content, influences the balance between oral tolerance and sensitization. My scientific and clinical training thus far has uniquely positioned me to address the above questions. My present clinical practice in the busy Center for Pediatric Eosinophilic Disorders at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, along with its 80% protected research time of my academic appointment, afford me the opportunity to focus my research efforts on a novel line of inquiry in food allergy. Today, my laboratory strives to understand how food-derived lipids contribute to food allergy sensitization, and I have developed state-of- the-art techniques to investigate, at a molecular level, iNKTs in humans. I am supported in my research by great mentors leaders in the fields of iNKT, and T cell biology (Dr Koretzki and Dr Nichols) and of clinical allergy (Dr Spergel). I also sought support from leader in the field of iNKT and NK biology (Dr Brenner and Dr Orange).

We believe that the answer is that iNKTs stimulated by food derived lipid can create a Th2 skewed environment necessary for food allergy sensitization. Our work will test this hypothesis and be of broad relevance in that it will define a novel mechanism by which immunological function can be regulated by dietary lipids as well as more specific insight into iNKTs function and iNKTs role in food allergy.",The Role Of INKTs In Eosinophilic Esophagitis.,2011,2014,"Cianferoni, Antonella ",Children's Hosp of Philadelphia,Philadelphia,PA,45,1,-1,5293

3R01ES019315-03S2,National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences,25,"Arsenic is a known developmental toxicant and carcinogen that affects the health of tens of millions of people around the globe. Prenatal exposure to arsenic has been associated with poor birth outcomes as well as increased risk for cancer later in life. While detrimental health effects have been linked to in utero exposure to arsenic, the underlying biological mechanisms have yet to be identified. Using a Thai cohort, we recently showed that in utero exposure to arsenic results in profound genome-wide alterations in transcript levels, and these transcripts enrich for the nuclear factor-kappa beta (NF-:B) pathway. In preliminary data, we have utilized next-generation sequencing to establish that arsenicosis may be associated with altered DNA methylation patterns in CpG islands of genes of the NF-:B pathway. Taken together, these data suggest that arsenic exposure may influence both genomic and epigenomic deregulation of the NF-:B pathway. The results have piqued our interest in understanding whether in utero exposure to arsenic may result in potentially heritable epigenetic changes to DNA. Based on the preliminary findings and our interest in understanding mechanisms by which prenatal exposure to arsenic may affect health later in life, we propose this study. Here we will examine the modulation of this pathway in newborns in Gsmez Palacio, Mexico and will assess two potential contributors to this modulation, namely epigenetic alterations and genetic variation. The central hypothesis is that exposure to arsenic alters newborn expression of the NF-:B inflammatory response pathway, and that this modulation is influenced by newborn genetics and epigenetics. This research will, in a comprehensive manner, examine the effects of in utero exposure to arsenic on the signaling of the NF-:B pathway in newborns in Mexico.

5R01ES016561-03,National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences,25,"The covalent modification of DNA is believed to be the initial step in chemical carcinogenesis. Exposure to carcinogens is often a result of environmental or work conditions, diet or smoking. In recent years, a number of heterocyclic amines (HCAs) have been isolated from cooked meats; the HCAs are highly mutagenic in bacterial assays and potent haptocarcinogens in rodents and non-human primates. HCA-DNA adducts have been detected from human tissue after exposure to dietary relevant doses. Human exposure to HCAs is widespread and usually occurs over a lifetime; epidemiological studies have linked red meat consumption with increased risk of colorectal, breast, and prostate cancers. As such, many HCAs have been classified as reasonably anticipated to be human carcinogens by the National Toxicology Program and are likely to play a significant role in diet related human cancers. We have proposed an extensive program that interactively uses chemical synthesis, structural biology, polymerase enzymology, and DNA repair studies to define the influence of local DNA sequence and the chemical nature of HCA-adducts on the etiology of HCA carcinogenesis. A foundation of this program is the ability of the PIs lab to synthesize oligonucleotides containing structurally defined C8- and N2-dG adducts of HCAs (Aim 1). Many HCAs are potent inducers of frameshift mutations and we will focus on HCA-adducts in frameshift prone sequences. Frameshift inactivation of tumor suppressor genes is observed in many human colorectal cancers. The conformation of duplex DNA containing HCA adducts will be studied by a variety of techniques including multi-dimensional NMR; the HCA-modified duplexes will be examined opposite dC in a full-length complement strand (Aim 2) as well as opposite a two-base deletion (Aim 3). In addition, we will pursue crystallographic analysis of pre- and post-insertion complexes of HCA-modified duplexes bound to the model Y-family polymerase Dpo4. A key hypothesis of this program is that the precise conformation of the slipped mutagenic intermediate will correlate to the adduct's propensity to induced frameshifts. This will be tested by in vitro replication studies of HCA-modified templates using prokaryotic and human Y-family DNA polymerases (Aim 4). The extension products will be sequenced using an LC-ESI-MS-MS analysis developed at Vanderbilt. Modified DNA templates and primers designed to mimic discrete intermediates in the frameshift mechanism will also be studied. Finally, we propose to correlate the conformation of the HCA adducts with lesion recognition by the repair proteins UvrA and XPC7HR23B (Aim 5).

5R03MH093184-02,National Institute of Mental Health,94,"The zinc metalloproteases from Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) and the Lethal Toxin (LT) of B. anthracis are critical for the toxicity of their host organisms and are excellent pharmaceutical targets. Both toxins are of interest as they are components of category A biothreat agents, but the botulinum toxins are particularly significant as they are commonly used pharmaceuticals with the potential for tragic misuse. To discover active compounds for these proteases we developed a high throughput flow cytometry based protease assay to perform pilot screens of the Prestwick Library, which identified 3 lead inhibitors for Botulinum neurotoxin type A light chain protease (BoNT/A LC) and 2 lead inhibitors for the Lethal Factor protease (LF) of B. anthracis LT. We have confirmed that Ebselen is a promising inhibitor specific for BoNT/A LC with an IC50 of 5 5M.  Based on our promising screening results we propose to perform extensive high throughput screening for inhibitory compounds against BoNT types A & F and LF in collaboration with the University of New Mexico Center for Molecular Discovery. Our screening assay uses high throughput flow cytometry to measure the cleavage of fluorescent fusion proteins that are attached to multiplexed microspheres. Beyond the speed at which compounds are screened, this assay is notable because it measures the activity of several proteases simultaneously across multiple full-length substrates. This offers several advantages that include reduced screening costs, homogenous endpoint activity assays, detection of inhibitors targeting known distal binding elements required for full protease activity, and immediate estimation of compound specificity via the inhibition pattern against different proteases. Lead compounds discovered in our screens will be confirmed via activity measurements in follow-up microsphere assays and two FRET protease assays, which use a simple FRET peptide or a fluorescently tagged avidin and our biotinylated fusion proteins containing full-length protease substrate and a terminal GFP tag. Our second FRET assay supports the use of full-length protease substrates, is solution based, and can be performed on fluorescence plate readers. Finally, promising compounds will be tested in cellular toxicity assays. LF toxicity assays will be performed on cells treated with LT and viability measured through luminescent readout of ATP production. We will test compounds targeting BoNT/A & F LC by administering BoNT/A & F LC to mammalian cells that intracellularly express fusion protein bearing CFP and YFP separated by a SNAP-25 or VAMP-2 substrate. Compound activity will be monitored via flow cytometry as a reduction of the loss of CFP to YFP FRET as compared to untreated cells. As a final assay, BoNT inhibitors that pass through this process will be compared in dose response assays against other commercially available BoNT LCs (B, C, D, & E) that are predicted to be active on all of our substrates. Due to the significant homology of all the BoNTs, we expect significant cross reactivity to these other proteases.  The combination of our novel screening approach with our confirmation assays will enable the rapid mulitplexed discovery of active compounds for BoNT/A & F LC and LF using a simple set of screens that implements three proteases simultaneously to dramatically reduce cost and labor. Furthermore, our approach has the novel ability to use full-length substrates that will enable the discovery of inhibitor compounds that target protease interactions with substrate binding sites distal to the active site. Thus, this screening proposal offers an inexpensive approach to rapidly discover new inhibitors including novel inhibitor types that would be invisible by other methods. These molecules will be valuable to pharmaceutical development efforts, biological projects focused on protease kinetics at surfaces, and potentially as probes for the SNARE protein complex formation in the neuronal exocytosis pathway.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal will discover new and important molecules that can serve as specific activity probes and inhibitors for the important toxin proteases from Botulinum neurotoxin and Bacillus anthracis. In this way, this proposal will discover important new compounds that can be the basis of new pharmaceuticals to treat Botulinum neurotoxin poisoning or late stage Anthrax infections.",High-Throughput Multiplex Microsphere Screening For Toxin Protease Inhibitors,2011,2012,"Graves, Steven W",University of New Mexico,Albuquerque,NM,36,1,361,5311

Preliminary examinations of selected L. monocytogenes isolates indicates that a sub-population of strains exhibit an enhanced ability to invade and infect cardiac tissue. It is hypothesized that these cardioinvasive strains have developed novel mechanisms and/or express novel or altered factors that enable them to replicate within cardiac tissue. The goal of this project will be to elucidate the mechanism(s) by which cardioinvasive isolates of L. monocytogenes target the heart for bacterial replication. The aims of this project are designed to elucidate the course and pathology of cardiac infection by L. monocytogenes as well as to identify bacterial factors responsible for increased cardio-tropism. Mouse models of infection will be used to define the time course and tissue distribution of cardioinvasive strains of L. monocytogenes. In vivo infections in mice will be monitored using bioluminescence imaging of L. monocytogenes strains containing lux reporter fusions, and subsequent histological examination of target tissues will be used to further elucidate pathogenesis and host inflammatory response. Comparative genomic analysis of cardioinvasive and noncardioinvasive strains will be used in combination with genetic approaches to identify bacterial factors that contribute to bacterial invasion and replication within cardiac cells. The use of transposon insertion mutagenesis in a highly cardioinvasive strain and the generation of bacterial insertion libraries will be done to enable the identification of bacterial factors that contribute to invasion and replication within cardiac cells. The libraries will be screened for mutants that lack the ability to invade and replicate within cardiac cell lines. Genetic analyses of these mutants will be used to elucidate virulence mechanisms responsible for the cardiotropism of cardioinvasive strains.

The parasites include Ascaris, Trichuris and hookworms. These infections are common. Ascariasis for example, affects 1.4 billion people worldwide and is most common in children between the ages of 3 and 8. Control of these nematode parasites relies on an effective supply of anthelmintics. Taking veterinary medicine as an example, we know that continued use of anthelmintic compounds for mass chemotherapy will lead to drug resistance. There is a need to identify novel target sites for anthelmintic development. Once such site is the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor on the nematode pharynx. We have discovered this receptor does not respond to currently used anrthelmintic drugs. Approach: The specific aims of this application are: 1. Characterize nAChR responses in A. suum pharynx: using current-, voltage- & patch- clamp techniques. We will test the hypothesis that the A. suum pharynx nAChRs are pharmacologically distinct from the muscle nAChRs activated by cholinergic anthelmintics. 2. Identify & clone pharyngeal specific nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits. We will identify the nAChR subunit genes present in the pharynx required to produce functional receptors. 3. Characterize the pharyngeal cholinergic receptors in Xenopus laevis oocytes using voltage- & patch-clamp techniques. We will test the hypothesis that expression of pharyngeal nAChR subunits results in functioning receptors that are pharmacologically similar to those found in vivo. On completion of this project we will have characterized the pharmacology of an important new potential drug target in a parasitic nematode. We will have identified the genes that encode these receptors. Finally, we will have reconstituted the receptors in an accessible platform suitable for screening potential new anthelmintics.

The study site is located in and around Ottawa County, Oklahoma, in the Grand Lake watershed. This watershed is potentially impacted by local and regional sources of atmospheric mercury deposition, but little is known about the extent of mercury contamination and bioaccumulation in this watershed. Exposure to methyl mercury through consumption of fish is a major public health concern, especially among children and women of childbearing age, due to its role as a neurotoxin and its tendency to biomagnify within food webs. This project was designed in response to community concerns about mercury exposure through consumption of local fish, and will involve a combination of food frequency questionnaires, measurements of hair mercury concentrations as biomarkers of mercury exposure, and measurements of mercury concentrations in commonly-consumed species of local fish. The primary aims of this project are: (1) to determine whether people living in Ottawa County who catch and consume fish from the Grand Lake watershed, particularly members of ethnic populations (Native Americans, Hispanics, Micronesians), have higher body burdens of mercury compared to other residents of the same geographic community that do not frequently consume local fish and compared to the general U.S. population; (2) to measure mercury concentrations in fish species commonly caught and consumed from Grand Lake and its major tributaries; (3) to promote safe subsistence fishing by educating community members about mercury concentrations in commonly consumed fish, including information on length, sampling location and season; (4) to develop a community- based education program that will enable community members to participate in the regulatory process at a more informed level; and (5) to promote long-term reductions in mercury concentrations in fish and human exposure by working with state and regional agencies to develop fish consumption advisories that protect subsistence fishers and promote reductions in mercury emissions. Our ultimate goal is to reduce mercury exposure while simultaneously addressing fears about mercury contamination that may unnecessarily limit consumption rates, and to promote subsistence activities that strengthen cultural and family bonds.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This project is designed to determine whether people who eat large amounts of local fish in northeastern Oklahoma are exposed to unsafe levels of mercury through their diet, and to help them find ways to decrease the amount of mercury they consume. This project will involve community participation at all stages of the research, and will emphasize sharing results with the community and developing ongoing educational programs. Ultimately, the results of this project also may be used to develop fish consumption advisories that protect all people, especially those that eat large amounts of fish, and to provide information for government agencies to use in creating regulations to control mercury emissions into the environment.",Mercury Exposure From Fish Consumption In Subsistence Fishers In Rural Oklahoma,2009,2014,"Schaider, Laurel A.",Harvard School of Public Health,Boston,MA,26,1,86,4018
5R21AI094427-02,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Cholera toxin subunit B (CTxB) binds to molecules presented on the surface of host intestinal epithelial cells. After the initial binding event, the holotoxin invades the cells, hijacking the cellular machinery to cause the profuse diarrhea that characterizes cholera infection. A complete understanding of the mechanistic details of cholera toxicity is necessary to facilitate the development of novel strategies to combat cholera outbreaks. While the ganglioside GM1a is widely described as the single receptor recognized by CTxB, recent data from our lab and others implies the existence of additional cholera toxin binding partners, which may be glycoproteins. The broad goals of this proposal are to identify novel CTxB binding partners and discover whether they function in cholera intoxication. The goal of Aim 1 is to identify cell surface molecules in T84 cells that are recognized by CTxB, making use of a novel photocrosslinking technique and modern mass spectrometry methods, along with traditional affinity purification approaches. Additional CTxB binding partners could play an auxiliary role, assisting in formation of the canonical CTxB-GM1a complex, or they might function as alternative receptors, enabling cholera toxin to bind cells in the absence of GM1a. The goal of Aim 2 is to distinguish between these possibilities, by using shRNAs to transiently knockdown expression of these alternative binding partners and glycosylation inhibitors to interfere with their post- translational modification. The results of these experiments will allow us to determine if the novel receptor or receptors are required for CTxB binding to T84 cells. While alternative binding partners might facilitate CTxB binding, a more critical question is whether they function in internalization of the toxin. The results of the immunofluorescence microscopy experiments and chloride ion secretion assays, proposed in Aim 3, will reveal whether previously unidentified CtxB receptors facilitate the process of cholera intoxication. This project challenges the existing paradigm that GM1a is both necessary and sufficient for CTxB binding and internalization. Along with the impact on our understanding of cholera disease progression, the results of the proposed experiments will be important for understanding and distinguishing among different mechanisms of endocytosis. Furthermore, because CTxB is commonly used to identify and visualize lipid rafts, a complete knowledge of CTxB binding partners will be vital to defining the composition and characteristics of membrane microdomains.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The bacteria Vibrio cholerae produce a toxin that binds to and invades human intestinal cells, causing the profuse diarrhea that characterizes cholera infection.

The parasite possesses a unique and essential organelle called the apicoplast,  which is genetically and functionally related to chloroplasts. Because the human host lacks a similar  organelle, the apicoplast is an important potential target for development of anti&#8208;parasitic agents. Little  is known about the biogenesis of this organelle, which is bounded by four membranes. Until now, only  targeting to the apicoplast lumen has been explored. Such proteins are targeted courtesy of a signal  sequence that allows entry into the secretory system and a transit peptide that routes them from the ER  to the plastid. We have presented provocative evidence that the latter step occurs in a Golgiindependent  manner. In the past grant period we identified two apicoplast membrane proteins (a  transporter and a protease), both of which lack canonical targeting sequences. In contrast to luminal  proteins, these proteins show cell cycle dependent localization to the apicoplast. Because of these  differences as well as the distinct ultimate destinations, the routes and sequences that mediate targeting  of non&#8208;luminal proteins likely involve novel elements. This proposal outlines experiments aimed at  characterizing a set of proteins localized to various apicoplast compartments, and will dissect the  mechanisms and sequences important for the proper localization of these proteins. We will also  determine whether targeting of apicoplast membrane proteins is assisted by molecules known to be  involved in ER exit processes or ER to Golgi trafficking.

A new generation of mucosal vaccines is being developed using probiotic Lactobacillus (L.) strains expressing anthrax-protective antigen (PA) fusion protein. Such an oral vaccine, expressed by probiotic Lactobacillus species not only optimally activates dendritic cells (DCs), but also delivers targeted antigens (i.e. anthrax PA) to mucosal DCs via 12-mer peptides derived from a bacteriophage library. We further optimized the expression of the immunogenic vaccine fusions expressed by L. gasseri. Obtained data clearly show that the use of a high copy vector for PA-DC fusion expression by L. gasseri confers robust immune protection against anthrax Sterne challenge. The objective of this proposal is to test the efficacy of such an oral multivalent vaccine consisting of anthrax PA and Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin serotype A (BoNT/A) heavy chain (Hc) in inhaled anthrax and BoNT/A intoxication and lastly to examine whether integration of the anthrax PA-DCpep and/or BoNT/A C-terminus of Hc-DCpep fusions into the L. gasseri chromosome is superior to plasmid-based approaches. Three novel approaches adapted for this work are: (a) improving adjuvanticity of the delivery vector by employing L. gasseri; (b) improving vaccine potency by specifically using a high copy vector for immunogenic fusions; and (c) expressing the multivalent immunogenic fusion vaccines in L. gasseri by bacterial chromosomal insertion and avoiding potential plasmid instability. Our hypothesis is that this optimized oral multivalent vaccine will induce mucosal and systemic immune responses against inhaled anthrax and BoNT/A in mice. The specific aims are: (1) to determine whether L. gasseri expressing targeted anthrax PA-DCpep or BoNT/A Hc-DCpep fusion vaccines enhances protective immunity against inhaled anthrax or BoNT/A intoxication; (2) to determine the protective efficacy of PA-DCpep or BoNT/A Hc-DCpep fusion vaccines in vivo, when expressed from a chromosomal location in L. gasseri; and (3) to determine the efficacy of the probiotic multivalent vaccine consisting of anthrax-PA and BoNT/A-Hc fusions against inhalational anthrax and BoNT/A challenge. This effort will be accomplished via novel adjuvants that provide targeting of the vaccine, evaluation of vaccine effectiveness against deadly pathogens, and the control of probiotic L. gasseri gene expression that can readily be orally consumed to enable natural delivery of targeted antigen to mucosal DCs.       Activation of a group of cells in our immune system, called dendritic cells, is critical for proper defense against different types of infection. The goal of this grant proposal is to provide tools for efficient activation of mucosal and systemic immune system using a new generation of harmless immunostimulatory bacteria called Lactobacillus gasseri that can be ingested as dietary supplements. Our data show that L. gasseri producing anthrax vaccine optimally generated robust protective immunity against anthrax infection.

1R01AI098078-01,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"In immunocompetent individuals, non-typhoidal Salmonella serotypes (NTS) are associated with gastroenteritis, a localized infection with low mortality manifesting as diarrhea, vomiting and intestinal cramping. However, in immunocompromised individuals, a breach of mucosal barrier functions can result in the development of a life threatening bacteremia. The incidence of disseminated NTS infections has reached epidemic status in sub-Saharan Africa, where these infections are associated with bacteremia, meningitis and sepsis, and often have a fatal outcome. In young children, epidemiologic studies have determined that severe malaria is an important immunocompromising condition predisposing to NTS bacteremia. In children with severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria the prevalence of disseminated NTS infections is particularly striking. However, the immune defects caused by severe malaria that increase the risk of developing NTS bacteremia, are not known. The objective of this application is to use our recently developed murine co-infection model of malaria and NTS to identify effects of malaria on the immune response to a subsequent bacterial infection. Our central hypothesis is that in pediatric patients, underlying malaria parasite infection leads to both a breach in intestinal barrier function and a reduced ability to check growth at systemic sites by interfering with neutrophil recruitment and bacteriocidal activity. We will test our hypothesis by (i) identifying mechanisms by which underlying malaria parasite infection compromises mucosal inflammation, and (ii) determining effects of malaria parasite infection on immunologic mechanisms that control bacterial organ loads. The fact that NTS/malaria co-infections are understudied, even though they represent a major cause of mortality in sub-Saharan Africa, makes the proposed work highly significant. We expect that the proposed research will provide important and novel insights into specific immune mechanisms that are important for mucosal barrier function to NTS infection. Further, the results of our proposed studies are likely to provide novel paradigms of how polymicrobial infections affect disease outcome.

The precise mechanism(s) by which EPEC causes diarrhea is currently not known. The bacteria elaborate a syringe-like type III secretion system that delivers key virulence factors directly into host intestinal epithelial cells. During the initial phase of infection, EPEC appears to specifically limit the death of the underlying epithelial cells. The focus of this proposal is the suppression of host cell death by the type III-secreted protein EspZ, which is unique to EPEC and related pathogens. Strains lacking EspZ are highly impaired for colonization and disease in animal models of infection. We hypothesize that EspZ interacts with host proteins to suppress premature death of infected enterocytes and, thereby, plays a key role in intestinal colonization by A/E pathogens. We propose to (1) validate the interaction of EspZ with host cell partners, define EspZ interaction domains, and generate specific EspZ mutants deficient for interaction(s), (2) characterize the role of EspZ and its interaction partners in activating signaling pathways that contribute to the survival of host cells, and (3) define the role of EspZ and its interaction partners in pathogenesis using animal models of infection.

Salmonella, Campylobacter, Shigella, and enterohemmorhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) cause most infections, particularly in children <5 years of age. These four pathogens contribute to a wide range of illnesses including both bloody and non-bloody diarrhea, but also cause kidney failure, neurological disorders and death in some cases. For most enteric bacterial pathogens, the disease process is initiated by transmission to a susceptible host, passage through the gut, and attachment to host epithelial cells lining the gastrointestinal tract Most pathogens have evolved a variety of specialized mechanisms that enhance this process, and in several cases, specific genotypes have been shown to cause more severe disease than others. While bacterial characteristics are clearly important, the role of the host in disease pathogenesis should not be overlooked, as the interplay between different pathogens and host microbial communities is likely to be important for disease development. Here, we propose to use pyrosequencing combined with metagenomics to investigate the impact that these four common diarrheal pathogens have on the composition and function of the intestinal microbiome. We will analyze stool DNAs from 200 healthy individuals without diarrhea and make comparisons to 800 individuals with diarrhea caused by EHEC, Salmonella, Campylobacter, and Shigella. The specific aims are: (1) Demonstrate that the composition, diversity and structure of the intestinal microbial community and the presence and expression of key virulence and antibiotic resistance genes impacts diarrheal disease caused by different enteric bacterial pathogens; (2) Determine that enteric disease profoundly affects the abundance of community members, the production and expression of microbiota by-products, and the distribution and diversity of functional marker genes (e.g., short chain fatty acids); and (3) Demonstrate that specific genetic and phenotypic characteristics of different enteric pathogens will more frequently and drastically alter the microbiome in patients with enteric disease. The proposed study will enhance our understanding of how the microbiome is impacted by infection with common enteric pathogens while controlling for gender, age, microbiota compositional and functional profiles, host immune responses, and bacterial characterisfics.

One such structure is the glycolipid known as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) that covers the surface of gram-negative bacteria. LPS is anchored to the bacterial cell by its lipid anchor known as lipid A. Lipid A is synthesized via a highly conserved pathway at the cytoplasmic face of the inner membrane. This is followed by addition of the core oligosaccharide and transport of the molecule across the inner membrane. The O-antigen polysaccharide is ligated to the core-lipid A in the periplasm completing LPS assembly. During the trafficking of LPS to the bacterial surface, latent enzymes modify the LPS structure contributing towards the diversity seen in LPS structure. For the most part, these enzymes target the lipid A anchor and the inner core oligosaccharide domains of the molecule. Since the lipid A is the bioactive component of LPS, these modifications can have a profound impact on disease, by altering LPS recognition by the mammalian innate immune receptor TLR4- MD2. Additionally, alteration of the LPS structure can directly impact the outer membrane permeability barrier, and bacterial resistance to host antimicrobial peptides. The overall objective of this proposal is to unravel the molecular mechanisms by which two pathogenic organisms, Helicobacter pylori and Campylobacter jejuni, modify their LPS structure and the role these modifications play in virulence. Although related, these pathogens have evolved unique modification machinery perhaps adapted for their specific ecological niche. The specific aims of the current proposal are: (1) characterization of Helicobacter pylori LPS modification machinery; (2) characterization of lipid A modifications in Campylobacter jejuni; and (3) impact of Helicobacter and Camyplobacter LPS remodeling on the host innate immune response. The completion of the Aims below will directly contribute to our understanding of how LPS modification machinery impacts pathogenesis. Finally, from this work will come new avenues of vaccine development and the ability to generate engineered LPS structures that could serve as potential adjuvants and/or LPS antagonists.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Gram-negative bacteria are responsible for a number of human infectious diseases. On the surface of these bacteria is a molecule called lipopolysaccharide or LPS that activates the human immune system. Bacteria modify their LPS structure which directly impacts disease.

5R01AI075259-05,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"The botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) are the most poisonous substances known and have been classified by the CDC as one of the six highest-risk threat agents for bioterrorism. They are responsible for the disease botulism, a neuroparalytic condition that can progress to flaccid paralysis and death if left untreated. The BoNTs exist as one of seven immunologically distinct serotypes (A-G). They act by entering neurons and cleaving proteins that mediate the exocytosis of neurotransmitters. They are thought to bind neurons through a dual-receptor mechanism that includes interactions with both ganglioside and protein receptors. The identity of the protein receptor depends on which of the seven BoNT serotypes is present, but the molecular determinants of receptor specificity and dual-receptor binding are currently unknown. This proposal describes two specific aims that explore the structural and functional properties of BoNT-receptor interactions. Recent evidence suggests that BoNT/A changes conformation upon binding ganglioside and has different affinities for the three isoforms of the synaptic vesicle protein (SV2) receptor. In Aim 1, we will define the interactions between BoNT/A, ganglioside, and SV2 using X-ray crystallography, site-directed mutagenesis, and binding assays. The requirement for ganglioside may not be as stringent in the pathogenesis of the BoNT/B and BoNT/G serotypes. These BoNTs are highly similar but have notable differences in how they interact with the two isoforms of synaptotagmin (SytI and II). In Aim 2, we will use X-ray crystallography, site-directed mutagenesis and binding assays to delineate the specificity and affinity requirements for BoNT/G-SytI interactions. Comparison to BoNT/B-SytII interactions will provide a molecular answer to how BoNT/B and /G differ in their interactions with the two Syt isoforms, while simultaneously illuminating the common features that could be exploited for inhibiting receptor binding in both serotypes. Together, these studies will provide insight into the fundamental mechanisms by which BoNT gains access to neurons and generate new strategies for the design and improvement of anti-botulism therapeutics and preventatives.

3R01AI081724-03S1,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Shigella, a major etiologic agent of diarrhea, dysentery, and mortality worldwide, causes disease by invading and disseminating through the colonic mucosa. Shigella sp. are CDC/NIAID priority pathogens. After inducing their own entry into cells, bacteria move to the cell periphery by actin-based motility. At the cell periphery, they push out against the plasma membrane, forming cell extensions that are engulfed by uninfected adjacent cells, whereupon the cycle of cell-to-cell dissemination is repeated.  Shigella and other intracellular pathogens enhance the process of infection by activating normal host cell signaling pathways. To activate these pathways, these microorganisms secrete into the host cell effector proteins that modulate the activity of specific host proteins. Whereas the molecular signaling events involved in S. flexneri entry into cells have been studied extensively, the signaling events involved in S. flexneri dissemination from one cell into an adjacent cell are poorly understood. In this application, we propose a detailed investigation of the molecular signaling events that occur during S. flexneri intercellular dissemination, using both targeted and genome-wide approaches.  Our preliminary data indicate that the cellular diaphanous formin proteins mDia1 and mDia2, which function in the stress fiber formation pathway, are required for efficient dissemination through cell monolayers. Our data also indicate that the secreted S. flexneri proteins IpgB2, OspE1, and OspE2 are required for this process and that these proteins trigger partially redundant host signaling pathways that likely involve mDia1 and mDia2. In addition, our data indicate that IpgB2/OspE1/OspE2-independent mechanisms also contribute to dissemination. Our targeted approaches will test the hypothesis that IpgB2, OspE1, and OspE2 activate specific steps in the stress fiber formation pathway. Our genome-wide approach will examine the human genome for additional factors involved in intercellular dissemination. Our specific aims are: 1. Characterize the mechanisms of S. flexneri IpgB2 activation of the stress fiber formation pathway; 2. Characterize the roles of secreted S. flexneri effector proteins OspE1 and OspE2 in intercellular dissemination; and, 3. Identify and characterize other host factors required for S. flexneri intercellular spread using a genome- wide human siRNA screen;  Our approaches are designed to generate insights not only into the molecular signaling that is required for intercellular dissemination of S. flexneri, but also into fundamental mechanisms of eukaryotic cellular and intercellular processes.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The human pathogen Shigella is a bacterium that causes diarrhea by infecting cells that line the human intestinal tract and disseminating through intestinal tissue by mechanisms that are poorly understood. The bacterium promotes dissemination by producing molecules that trigger specific responses in the infected cells that enhance the movement of bacteria into adjacent uninfected cells; we propose detailed studies into the molecular signaling involved in the dissemination of Shigella through tissue.

While supported by this application, we have made significant contributions to the understanding of the genetic sequence variants and their relationships with asthma and IgE responsiveness in various populations. Our fine-mapping studies of 1500 SNPs have identified sub- regions of chromosome 11 (Chr. 11) with strong evidence of association with asthma in an African American population, which may contain genetic variants critical for the etiology of asthma. Further, we have used positional candidate gene approaches and published findings on functional sequence variants of nine candidate genes in various populations, including African American, Chinese and Japanese populations. Notably, sequence variants of the genes encoding a Clara cell secretory 10 kd protein (CC10, an immunomodulator and steroid-inducible protein) and IL-17F were shown to be associated with atopic phenotypes, including bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Moreover, supported by this application, we have initiated a collaborative study focusing on the genetic influence of the genes encoding members of the C-type lectin receptor (CLR) family, known to be critical in innate immunity, on the genesis of allergy and asthma, in which we have provided initial evidence for genetic association of several candidate CLR genes and allergic phenotypes, including asthma and IgE responsiveness. We propose, therefore, in this new grant period, to continue these ongoing efforts and to identify specific functional polymorphisms in these candidate genes, and to relate the polymorphism to the expression of IgE, asthma and food allergy phenotypes in different groups of families and unrelated subjects. Specifically, we intend to test three hypotheses: Hypothesis #1: Chr. 11 contains susceptibility genes for asthma; Hypothesis #2: Sequence variants of CC10 and IL-17F along with their respective receptors, formyl peptide receptor-like 1 (FPRL1) and IL-17R, differentially regulate the expression of asthma; Hypothesis #3: Sequence variants of the genes encoding members of the CLRs influence the development of asthma and food allergy.",Immunogenetic Analysis Of Human Immune Response To Allergens,2003,2014,"Huang, Shau-Ku ",Johns Hopkins University,Baltimore,MD,25,1,97,5064

C. jejuni is unusual for an enteric pathogen in that is produces a polysaccharide capsule. There is evidence that a vaccine consisting of a C. jejuni capsule conjugated to CRM197, a diphtheria toxoid used in licensed conjugate vaccines, was protective against diarrheal disease in non-human primates (NHP). Evidence also exists that fimbrial tip adhesins, which are less antigenically diverse than the major fimbrial subunits, are also protective in NHP's and humans. Conjugation of these ETEC proteins to C. jejuni capsules provides a novel approach to development of multivalent, broad-spectrum vaccines against two major causes of bacterial diarrhea. /project narrative Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) and Campylobacter jejuni (CJ) are major causes of diarrheal disease worldwide.

There is a paucity of molecular and genetic insight into EE, a poor  understanding of the relationship between IgE-triggered food allergy and EE, and there is currently no  approved drug for this food allergic disease, highlighting the need for innovative fundamental studies focused  on EE. We have shown that EE appears to have a strong genetic component based on the frequent  presence of a familial inheritance pattern and the high sibling risk ratio (~80-fold). Based on screening a  custom DNA array containing 738 SNPs, we have identified an association of EE with SNPs associated with  the gene encoding thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), a key cytokine known to regulate Th2 cell  polarization. Notably, using an independent genome wide association study (GWAS) approach, we have  preliminarily linked EE with the same promising genetic locus (chromosome 5q22 near the TSLP and  WDR36 genes). The fact that two independent approaches have linked EE with the same genetic region,  and the finding that this region contains the gene for a key protein involved in Th2-associated immunemediated  responses, highlights our interest in focusing on this finding. Our central hypothesis is that EE has  strong genetic components that can be elucidated by a candidate gene approach focused on genes involved  in asthma and allergy and by a GWAS analysis. Using these approaches, our preliminary studies have led  us to the hypothesis that EE susceptibility involves the TSLP/WDR36 locus, a region known to be involved in  allergic responses. We are well positioned to answer key genetic questions concerning EE based on a  multi-faceted approach: (1) genetic analysis of EE DNA samples using relatively large and unique cohorts of  well-characterized EE patient samples obtained from multiple CoFAR sites; (2) our ability to validate lead  genetic candidates using a cohort of parent offspring trios; and (3) our ability to test genotype/phenotype  relationships using our EE sample databank.

Unfortunately, cholera still remains a serious health threat to developing countries with approximately 3-5 million cases occurring annually. V. cholerae is a normal inhabitant of aquatic environments, belonging to the free-living bacterial flora in estuarine areas. Although approximately 200 recognized O serogroups are known, only V. cholerae strains bearing the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) somatic antigens O1 or O139 have been associated with cholera pandemics. As is the case with most Gram-negative bacteria, the LPS of V. cholerae is composed of three distinct regions the membrane associated lipid A domain, a short core oligosaccharide, and the O-antigen polysaccharide. Although the lipid A domain is an essential component of Gram-negative bacterial membranes and is synthesized via a conserved pathway, it is a highly diverse molecule. Pathogenic bacteria modify the lipid A domain of their LPS in response to their surrounding environment. Since lipid A is the bioactive portion of LPS, these modifications can have a profound impact on disease, by altering LPS recognition via the innate immune receptor complex, TLR4/MD-2. Additionally, alteration of the lipid A structure can impact the outer membrane permeability barrier, and bacterial resistance to host antimicrobial peptides. Our overall objective is to understand how alterations in the structure of LPS located on the bacterial surface promote survival of V. cholerae both in the aquatic environment and in the human host.

With the recent emergence of hypervirulent strains, the incidence of C. difficile infection (CDI) has increased significantly in both North America and Europe, causing lengthy hospitalization, substantial morbidity and mortality. CDI is thought to be mainly mediated by exotoxins TcdA and TcdB, which glucosylate low molecular mass GTPase of the Rho family, leading to massive fluid secretion, acute inflammation, and necrosis of the colonic mucosa. Our long-term goal is to understand the mechanisms mediating intestinal inflammation in C. difficile infection and to utilize this knowledge for the design of better immune interventions in order to reduce the incidence of CDI and severity of the disease. The interaction of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) with intestinal antigen presenting cells (APCs), such as dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, in the gut orchestrates mucosal immune homeostasis and inflammatory response. Our objective is to elucidate the immune response of IECs and intestinal DCs after their exposure to C. difficile toxins and to determine the nature of their interaction on initiating intestinal inflammation and tissue destruction. To achieve this objective, we will test several working hypotheses: 1) C. difficile toxin-intoxicated IECs are capable of mobilizing and activating DCs; 2) In severe cases of CDI, C. difficile toxins can cross a severely damaged intestinal barrier and further activate DCs and macrophages; and 3) proinflammatory cytokine TNF-a synergizes with the toxins to induce apoptosis of IECs, thus exacerbating tissue destruction and enterocolitis. By testing these hypotheses, we expect to gain a better understanding of not only the underlying mechanisms by which C. difficile toxins induce severe enterocolitis, but also the role of IEC-DC interaction in the onset and development of intestinal inflammatory diseases in general. We believe that such an understanding will help us to design better immune interventions against CDI and other intestinal inflammatory diseases.

Secretor oligosaccharides bind to adhesins of enteropathogens, inhibiting their binding to cell surface glycans of the gastrointestinal tract.

This bacterium is strongly associated with localized aggressive periodontitis (LAP). The organism is an opportunistic pathogen causing serious systemic diseases including pneumonia, infective endocarditis, and may contribute to cardiovascular disease. The pathogenicity of the organism has been ascribed to virulence determinants including adhesins, invasins and toxin secretion. These factors must translocate two distinct membranes to be functionally active. In A. actinomycetemcomitans, the biogenesis and protein composition of the inner and outer membranes remain largely undefined. We have identified a novel gene morC, encoding a 141 kDa membrane protein with previously unknown function. The null mutant showed changes in the morphology of the outer membrane, membrane permeability and a marked decreased secretion of leukotoxin. The importance of MorC to maintain membrane morphology and function is supported by these findings. The morphogenesis protein (MorC) is highly conserved among gram-negative human pathogens. In Aggregatibacter and related genera, the gene is located in a three-gene operon under the control of a promoter responsive to environmental changes. This operon may be regulated by a two-component signal transduction system. The conservation of this gene and the operon structure among a variety of bacterial species implies an important role of this protein in the biology of these microorganisms. To better understand the role of MorC in membrane biogenesis and pathogenicity, we propose the following aims: 1) molecular characterization of the morC operon; 2) determination of the functional domain(s) of MorC; and 3) determination of the role of MorC in leukotoxin secretion and membrane biogenesis.

To elucidate the mechanism by which adenylyl cyclase toxins and other luminal microbial products (TLR ligands) stimulate and modulate the mucosal microenvironment to promote effector Thi7 responses, we propose in Aim 1 to define how oral CT administrafion enhances Th17-promoting dendritic cells (DC) and suppresses Treg-promoting DC. We will explore the role of cAMP and retinoic acid in these processes, and characterize the subsequent Th cell response provoked by different MLN DC subsets. In Aim 2, we will characterize the phenotype, stability and lineage differentiation markers of CD4 T cells from in vitro- and in vivo-differentiated CT-induced Thi7 subsets, and evaluate the infiammatory/regulatory impact of orally delivered CT on the outcome of Thi7 cell-mediated colitis. Aim 3 will explore the role of CGRPP produced by CT-activated DC in a mucosal Thi7 response. Aim 4 will investigate the potential contributing role of TLR stimulation to CT-induced Thi7 differentiation.

The specific aims of this proposal are to answer important mechanistic questions by analyzing specific novel NO. targets: [1] How do bacteria sense and respond to host-derived NO.?-- NsrR, a nitrite- sensitive repressor of defenses against nitrosative stress; [2] How does NO. constrain bacterial metabolism?-- LpdA, or lipoamide dehydrogenase, an essential subunit of enzymes required for the TCA cycle and amino acid biosynthesis [3] How does NO. disrupt redox homeostasis?-- PFL, or pyruvate-formate lyase, which converts pyruvate to acetyl CoA and formate to facilitate the regeneration of NAD+ under oxygen-limited conditions NO. cytotoxicity will be analyzed in two important bacterial pathogens. NsrR and LpdA will be studied in the enteric bacterium Salmonella Typhimurium. PFL will be investigated in the gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus, which employs a unique strategy to bypass PFL inhibition by NO.. This project will examine a variety of potential molecular mechanisms for protein inactivation by NO through destabilization of iron-sulfur clusters, iron-nitrosyl formation, S-nitrosylation, or glycyl radical quenching. The aims will be achieved by a combination of genetic, biochemical and in vivo analyses in routine use in our laboratory. Insights from these studies will provide an integrated picture of how host- derived NO. alters the metabolism of invading bacteria to impair growth and how pathogens can overcome these actions by detoxifying NO. or bypassing crucial sites of inhibition. PROJECT NARRATIVE The body's immune cells produce nitric oxide to limit the growth of microorganisms. This research project analyzes the mechanisms by which nitric oxide exerts toxic effects on bacteria and the mechanisms by which pathogenic bacteria such as Salmonella and Staphylococcus resist this important host defense mechanism. Such studies will help to identify novel strategies for the prevention or treatment of infection.",Nitric Oxide Cytotoxicity In Salmonellosis,1997,2013,"Fang, Ferric C",University of Washington,Seattle,WA,56,1,224,393

IMP dehydrogenase (IMPDH) presents a similar therapeutic opportunity. Although IMPDH inhibitors are used in immunosuppressive, cancer and antiviral therapy, as yet IMPDH inhibitors have not been exploited in antibacterial applications because no bacterial-selective IMPDH inhibitors have been identified. We have been engaged in a medicinal chemistry program to develop IMPDH-targeted drugs for treating the category B parasite Cryptosporidium parvum. We have 'in hand' low nanomolar inhibitors of C. parvum IMPDH (CpIMPDH) with >250 selectivity versus the human enzymes. Surprisingly, CpIMPDH is most closely related to bacterial IMPDHs, suggesting that C. parvum obtained this gene via horizontal transfer. We have identified a structural motif that defines susceptible enzymes; this motif is found in a wide variety of pathogenic bacteria, including seven other select agents. We propose a program to develop the CpIMPDH inhibitors as broader spectrum antibiotics. To this end, we will determine the efficacy of the CpIMPDH inhibitors against a panel of pathogenic bacteria chosen to define the spectrum of action in terms of the structural variation of the target enzyme and the permeability of the bacteria (select agents in bold): Bacillus anthracis (Gram positive), Francisella tularensis (Gram-negative facultative intracellular), Listeria monocytogenes (Gram- positive facultative intracellular), Burkholderia mallei/pseudomallei (Gram-negative facultative intracellular), Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive) and Acinetobacter baumannii (Gram-negative). These pathogens pose some of the most serious threats to human health; B. anthracis, Bu. mallei/pseudomallei, and F. tularensis are top priorities for countermeasure development and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and A. baumannii present major treatment challenges.",IMPDH-Targeted Antibiotics For Select Agents,2011,2016,"Hedstrom, Lizbeth K.",Brandeis University,Waltham,MA,26,1,1191,5056

Recent developments in the generation and use of these reagents have made them a powerful  new tool with which to study antigen-specific T cell responses, particularly in humans where experimental  manipulation of T cells is extremely limited by feasibility issues. The overall objective of the Tetramer Core is  to provide researchers from each of the proposed projects with the resources necessary to use tetramer  technology to study allergen-specific T cells in mice and humans. The specific aims of the Tetramer Core  will be 1) to generate pMHCII tetramers to defined allergens studied in the proposed projects, and 2) to  provide technical expertise in tetramer-based enrichment techniques to enable identification of low frequency  allergen-specific T cells. State-of-the-art tetramers will be generated incorporating the most advanced  technical refinements to date. Recombinant DNA constructs encoding soluble forms of pMHCII molecules  fused to immunogenic peptide epitopes from defined allergens will be cloned and expressed in an insect cell  expression system. Purified biotinylated pMHCII complexes will then be tetramerized via their interaction  with fluorescently labeled streptavidin molecules. For each allergen studied in human subjects, a panel of  tetramers corresponding to several common HLA-DR alleles will be generated to ensure adequate  applicability of these reagents to the HLA-diverse study population. Because antigen-specific T cell  populations are often present in very low frequencies, tetramers will often be used in conjunction with  antibody-coated magnetic beads to enable enrichment of tetramer-positive cells. This will allow for high-resolution  detection of allergen-specific T cells from small amounts of human cell samples. The Tetramer  Core will provide technical support to researchers so they can quickly master these techniques. Collectively,  the services provided by the Tetramer Core will enable researchers to immediately take advantage of this  powerful technology that otherwise may not be readily available at a practical scale for many years.",Tetramer Core,,,"Moon, James J",Massachusetts General Hospital,Boston,MA,26,1,106,-1

5R01AI048082-07,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Giardia lamblia, which is spread by the fecal-oral route, is an important parasitic cause of diarrhea in the US and the developing world. The infectious and diagnostic stage of Giardia is the quadranucleate cyst, which has a wall composed in part by fibrils of a unique GalNAc homopolymer. During the previous funding period, we have made many discoveries concerning glycosylation of Giardia proteins (Aim 1) and the formation of the cyst wall (Aim 2).  These discoveries have suggested two related hypotheses that will be pursued in the proposed experiments. First, protein glycosylation in Giardia is much simpler than that of the human host or of model eukaryotes such as Saccharomyces. Therefore studies of Giardia glycans in Aim 1 will provide insights concerning the diversity and evolution of protein glycosylation, as well as providing a better description of Giardia glycoproteins. The second hypothesis is that the cyst wall of Giardia is composed of a small number of proteins, which are lectins that bind fibrils of the GalNAc homopolymer. Studies in Aim 2 that characterize enzymes involved in synthesis and degradation of the Giardia cyst wall will lead to insights into the mechanism of pathogenesis of this parasite and provide an alternative wall model that is distinct from those of fungi that contain multiple sugar polymers and ~100 proteins.  Progress towards Aim 1 included demonstration that Giardia makes a 2-sugar N-glycan precursor rather than the 14-sugar precursor made by metazoans and fungi. The Giardia oligosaccharyl transferase (OST) that transfers N-glycans has a single subunit rather than 8 subunits. There is selection for sites of N- linked glycans in eukaryotes with N-glycan-dependent quality control (QC) of protein folding, but there is no such selection in Giardia.UDP-GlcNAc is the only nucleotide-sugar transported into the ER lumen of Giardia. Proposed experiments towards Specific Aim 1 will characterize the single-subunit OST of Giardia and characterize what we predict is a unique GPI anchor of Giardia. Progress toward Aim 2 included use of wheat germ agglutinin, which binds to the Giardia N-glycans, to dramatically enrich secreted and membrane proteins. Cyst-specific glycoproteins included a candidate for the GalNAc homopolymer synthase. The GalNAc homopolymer, which was isolated free of protein, maintains its hollow spherical shape based upon interlocking loops of curled fibrils. The Leu-rich repeat domain of the Giardia cyst wall protein 1 is a lectin that binds the GalNAc homopolymer. Proposed experiments towards Specific Aim 1 will explore further a curled fibril and lectin model of the Giardia cyst wall, isolate the synthase for the unique GalNAc homopolymer, and characterize the glycohydrolase that breaks down the GalNAc polymer during excystation.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Giardia lamblia, which is spread by poor hygiene, is an important cause of diarrhea in the US, Europe, and developing countries.

1R01AI101084-01,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Pathogenic bacteria such as Salmonella enterica contain horizontally acquired DNA on plasmids or genomic islands that play a critically important role in host-pathogen interactions. Most virulence genes are regulated at the level of transcription in order to be coordinately expressed under specific environmental conditions. Classical models of transcriptional regulation involve regulated binding of specific DNA sequences by proteins that interact with RNA polymerase to activate or repress gene expression. Our studies of a Nucleoid-Associated Protein (NAP) called H-NS have recently shown that many horizontally acquired virulence genes are controlled by an alternative paradigm in which intrinsic transcriptional silencing by NAPs that bind DNA with relatively low specificity is countered by the actions of other DNA binding proteins. The latter are comprised of classical transcriptional activators, repressors, and alternative sigma factors. This model, designated xenogeneic silencing, provides a mechanism by which the potentially deleterious impact of horizontally acquired sequences can be minimized by silencing, and newly acquired genes are subsequently integrated into pre-existing regulatory networks through counter-silencing. DNA binding proteins such as PhoP, SlyA, OmpR, SsrB and &#191;S (RpoS) are known to be essential for Salmonella virulence. We propose that many, if not most, genetic loci regulated by these proteins are in fact controlled by counter-silencing mechanisms. This application aims to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of silencing and counter-silencing by biochemically analyzing the transcriptional regulation of individual genes and relating expression to interactions between NAPs and counter-silencing proteins. We hypothesize that counter-silencing proteins act by relieving NAP-induced DNA stiffening to facilitate RNA polymerase open complex formation or by overcoming open complex trapping by NAPs. The specific aims are: 1. Determination of Transcriptional Regulatory Mechanisms in the PhoP Regulon. The prototypical Salmonella PhoP regulon will be subjected to bioinformatic and functional analysis to distinguish genetic loci controlled by direct activation and those controlled by counter-silencing mechanisms. 2.Analysis of Silencing and Counter-Silencing Mechanisms for Selected PhoP-dependent Genes. Individual counter-silenced genes from the PhoP regulon will be analyzed using biochemical and biophysical methods to determine the functional and mechanical consequences of DNA binding by NAPs (H-NS, StpA) and counter-silencing by the PhoP and SlyA proteins. 3. Characterization of Counter-Silencing by the Alternative Sigma Factor &#191;S. Genetic loci co-regulated by H-NS and &#191;S will be subjected to functional, biochemical and biophysical analysis and compared with counter-silencing by PhoP and SlyA.

This project expands the concept of xenogeneic silencing in pathogenic bacteria, a conceptual breakthrough our lab has discovered in the understanding of regulatory network evolution and control of virulence gene expression.

5R01DK091566-02,National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,24,"Biliary atresia is the most common cause of pediatric end stage liver disease and the number one indication for pediatric liver transplantation. Because pathogenic viruses have been found in the liver of afflicted children, a proposed etiology for biliary atresia is a perinatal viral infection triggering immune mediated destruction of the biliary epithelium. The murine model of biliary atresia supports a viral pathogenesis as newborn mice infected with rhesus rotavirus (RRV) develop inflammation within the portal tract and extra- hepatic bile duct obstruction. RRV targets the cholangiocyte for infection and in addition to direct cholangiocyte injury also induces T-cell mediated injury to the biliary epithelium.  Rotavirus is a dsRNA virus comprised of 11 gene segments. We hypothesized that specific rotavirus genes govern the ability to infect the cholangiocyte and induce immune mediated injury. To test this hypothesis, we generated a complete set of single gene reassortants derived from the parental strains RRV and TUCH. These reassortants give us a unique set of tools to determine how specific rotavirus genes contribute to the pathogenesis. In preliminary studies, we found that RRV segments 3, 4, 6, 8, 9 and 11 are genes of interest. Given the robust nature of the observations made with gene segment 4, we focused on this gene. We will use in vitro models of RRV - cholangiocyte infection and T-cell activation to determine the mechanisms by which gene segment 4 contributes to disease pathogenesis. We will also use reverse genetics to generate mutate gene segment 4 infectious virus to determine the basis in the more complex environment of the intact host. These complimentary approaches will generate new insight in viral induced biliary atresia.

1R01ES021930-01,National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences,25,"There is a critical knowledge gap regarding the impacts of chronic low-level exposure to common environmental toxins such as the neurotoxic amino acid, domoic acid (DA), a phycotoxin naturally produced during harmful algal blooms (HABs).  Accumulation of DA in the food web poses significant health threats to humans and wildlife and is responsible for a neurotoxic illness known as amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP).  Regular monitoring of DA levels in edible shellfish tissues has been effective in protecting human consumers from acute high-level DA exposure.  However, there is no protection from chronic low-level DA exposure, which may pose significant human health risks, particularly in coastal and tribal communities that subsistence harvest shellfish known to contain low levels of the toxin.  In fact, recent findings b a member of this investigative team suggest that significant cognitive impairment and increased seizure prevalence occur in a coastal cohort of shellfish consumers compared to non-consumers of DA-containing shellfish. The subclinical health effects and underlying mechanisms of chronic toxicity are difficult to elucidate primarily due to the lack of a biomarker specific for chronic exposure.  The investigators' research team has discovered 1) a novel antibody based biomarker that is a specific signature for chronic low-level DA exposure, and 2) that chronic exposure increases toxin susceptibility in subsequent exposures in a zebrafish chronic exposure model.  Here they test the hypothesis that a DA- specific antibody is a persistent biomarker for low-level chronic exposure that results in neurotoxicity even in the absence of the overt neurobehavioral symptoms characteristic of acute exposure.  The investigators have detected the antibody biomarker in naturally DA-exposed California sea lions, thereby ensuring that the antibody response occurs in mammals under environmentally relevant exposure conditions. The overall goals of the study are to 1) develop and validate a biomarker for chronic low-level exposure to DA, 2) link this biomarker to quantifiable subclinical neurotoxic  logical endpoints, and 3) quantify the effects of chronic exposure on overall whole animal toxin susceptibility (i.e., increased sensitivity or resistance) in a mammalian model system. This is the  first solid step towards developing a viable diagnostic test for assessing health impacts of chronic low-level DA exposure and will be an important tool for monitoring changes in exposure risks associated with changing ocean conditions.

The lack of a cell culture and animal model has hindered progress in understanding host susceptibility and host-viral interactions. Recently, NoVs have been identified as an important enteric pathogen of travelers' diarrhea. The principal investigator has a unique opportunity to study host genetic determinants and immune responses to NoV gastroenteritis in a large (n = 600) prospective cohort of US travelers to Mexico, India, or Peru. Our longterm goals are to: 1) to define important genetic determinants of susceptibility and mechanisms of host immunity to NoV infection to further vaccine development against NoVs, and 2) to identify vulnerable populations who may most benefit from vaccination. In order to achieve these goals, we propose the following specific aims: 1) to evaluate whether secretor status is an important determinant of risk of NoV infection, clinical severity of infection, and level of fecal viral shedding; 2) to study the role of preexisting antibodies to NoVs in protection against NoV infection; 3) to evaluate the cellular immune response elicited in subjects with NoV diarrhea. The 1st specific aim will be accomplished by secretor phenotyping with saliva specimens and genotyping from serum samples. NoV detection will be performed with quantitative real-time PCR and serum antibody conversion. The 2nd aim will be achieved by evaluating for preexisting anti-NoV antibodies and assessing for potential neutralization capacity of detected antibodies, with in vitro inhibition of VLP binding to histo-blood group antigen carbohydrates assays.

A 2008 CDC report indicated an 18% rise in childhood  food allergy from 1997-2007 with an estimated 3.9% of children currently affected. Milk or egg allergies in  infants/young children are most common (~2.5%), and typically resolve, although recent reports indicate  increasing persistence beyond age 5 years. Peanut allergy now affects approximately 1% of young children,  which is double the prevalence reported just over a decade ago. Peanut allergy is often severe, sometimes  fatal and, in contrast to milk and egg allergy, resolves in only 20% of patients. There is only a limited  understanding of the mechanisms involved in the developmental course of food allergies. For peanut allergy  in particular, it is not known why only certain atopic individuals acquire this allergy, or what mechanisms are  responsible for its permanence. To effectively prevent or reverse the progression of food allergy, immune  interventions will be needed. Furthermore, it is likely that successful strategies will need to be directed to  those persons at identifiable risk (e.g., who have biomarkers associated with development of peanut allergy).  This multi-center, longitudinal observational study completed enrollment in March 2008. The cohort includes  512 infants initially age 3-15 months with likely egg/milk allergy or moderate-severe atopic dermatitis and a  positive allergy prick skin test to egg or milk, but without current known peanut allergy. These criteria were  employed to establish a cohort with an increased risk to have or develop peanut allergy. There has been a  98% retention rate for ongoing serial allergy assessments. Clinical information and DNA samples were also  obtained from 250 of their siblings as a control group. Continuation of this study is required to determine the  clinical course of peanut, egg and milk allergies. These final clinical outcomes will be used to delineate,  compare and contrast biologic markers and immunologic changes associated with development of peanut  allergy and loss of egg and milk allergy, while simultaneously addressing genetic and environmental  influences. This cohort will also serve as a comparator group for children with eosinophilic esophagitis and  for those undergoing immunotherapies to peanut as described in additional projects in this Consortium.

Very recently, mounting evidence points to the dual function of Nrf2 in cancer. (i) In normal cells when the Nrf2- Keap1 axis is intact and basal level of Nrf2 are low, transient activation of Nrf2 by chemopreventive compounds confers protection against environmental toxins and carcinogens. (ii) In certain cancer cell lines, constitutive activation of Nrf2 creates an environment conducive for cancer cell survival. Moreover, Nrf2 contributes to chemoresistance and inhibition of the Nrf2 pathway enhances the efficacy of cancer treatments. Arsenic (As) is a human carcinogen, which causes tumors in the skin, lung and bladder. Large populations around the world are exposed to arsenic through contaminated drinking water, which imposes a major challenge to human health. However, a sufficient rodent model to study arsenic-carcinogenicity is still lacking. This competing renewal of NIH ES015010 takes advantage of a previously unrecognized role of arsenic in autophagy leading to prolonged activation of Nrf2, which was uncovered during the last funding period. We hypothesize that arsenic-mediated carcinogenicity is associated with its ability to deregulate the autophagic pathway. We believe that canonical Nrf2 inducers can alleviate this effect and thus, can be used as chemopreventive agents to counteract the damaging effects of arsenic. The following three aims are proposed: Aim 1 (in vitro): Elucidate a novel mechanism of Nrf2 induction by arsenic through deregulation of autophagy (prolonged activation of Nrf2). Aim 2 (ex vivo): Determine the role of Nrf2 in arsenic-mediated autophagosome formation and carcinogenicity using a transplantable syngeneic mouse lung cancer model. Aim 3 (in vivo): Validate the biological and pharmacological relevancy of this work. From this proposal we will (i) gain novel mechanistic insight of how arsenic deregulates autophagy, (ii) confirm the association between deregulation of autophagy and tumorigenicity of arsenic, (iii) provide new biomarkers and a sensitive animal model for arsenic carcinogenicity studies and (iv) demonstrate the potential translational impact of targeting the Nrf2 pathway using canonical Nrf2 activators to combat arsenic-induced toxicity and carcinogenicity.

1P01ES021923-01,National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences,25,"PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):  The overall objective of the proposed research is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which short-term exposure to harmful algal bloom (HAB) toxins and marine toxicants during development causes physiological and neurological abnormalities later in life. It is now well known that the early life environment can have a profound effect on the health of adults (the developmental origins of health and disease). However, the mechanisms by which developmental exposure elicits effects later in life are not understood. The central  hypothesis of this research is that embryonic exposure to certain marine toxins or toxicants alters epigenetic programming, leading to long-term effects on gene expression in adult tissues and ultimately contributing to altered neurobehavioral function in adults. We will conduct studies to identify a core set of genes that show long-term transcriptional changes due to changes in the early life chemical environment and identify their epigenetic signature to determine the mechanistic link between adult phenotype and early life exposures.  These studies will be conducted using zebrafish, a powerful model organism for research on developmental mechanisms. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that developmental exposure to HAB toxins (saxitoxin, domoic acid) and toxicants (PCB126, PCB153) causes later life changes in gene expression and behavior.  In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that adult effects resulting from developmental exposure to HAB toxins and toxicants are caused by epigenetic reprogramming of gene expression, focusing on altered DNA methylation and microRNA expression. In Aim 3, we will determine whether the proximal mechanisms involving receptors and ion channels known to be responsible for the acute effects of these chemicals are  also involved in the delayed effects seen in adults exposed to chemicals during development. This research will identify molecular bases for adult effects occurring after developmental exposure to important HAB toxins and marine toxicants, and determine whether there are similar or convergent epigenetic mechanisms involved.",Epigenetic Mechanisms Of Toxicity After Developmental Exposure To Marine Toxins,,,"Hahn, Mark E",Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution,Woods Hole,MA,26,1,1649,8540
1R03AI099315-01,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"The goal of this R03 application is to determine in vivo roles of fascin1 in dendritic cell (DC)-based immunity against infection of Listeria monocytogenes (Lm). DCs, the most potent antigen presenting cells, play central roles in both innate and acquired immunity. When DCs encounter pathogens, they undergo terminal differentiation called maturation: they assemble numerous veil-like membrane protrusions, travel from the peripheral tissues to draining lymph nodes, and present antigens to naive T-cells. Fascin1 is a unique actin-bundling protein in DCs because it is greatly and specifically induced upon DC maturation. Fascin1 is absent in immature DCs or in other blood cells including macrophages, neutrophils and natural killer cells, suggesting a specific role for fascin1 in DC biology upon maturation. Indeed, we and others have demonstrated that fascin1 is critical for the maturation-associated functions including massive reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, chemotactic migration of DCs into draining lymph nodes, T-cell activation and assembly of the immunological synapse. We have found, by characterizing fascin1 KO DCs, that fascin1 plays a novel role in a DC-mediated host defense system. It has been reported that DCs show a stronger intracellular killing activity toward Lm than do macrophages. This resistance to Lm is thought to be crucial for the DCs primary function of antigen presentation: DCs must survive infection at the periphery and then move to draining lymph nodes for transferring antigen information to T-cells. We found that fascin1 KO DCs displayed higher susceptibility to Lm-mediated killing. Importantly, DCs with high fascin1 expression was extremely resistant to Lm infection. We further found that fascin1 made Lm-encapsulated phagosomes more acidic, and increases autophagy flux. These results indicate that fascin1 increases lysosomal fusion of both phagosomes and autophagosomes for bacterial clearance, explaining why DCs (fascin1-positive) are more resistant than macrophages (fascin1-negative). However, a key question remains to be answered: Is fascin1 crucial for DC-based adaptive and innate immunity against Lm infection in vivo? We will examine, by using the Lm mouse model, whether fascin1 KO mice show reduced adaptive and innate immune responses to Lm infection. The proposal is likely to provide vital information that will help us develop new DC-based immunotherapy against bacterial infection.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The elucidation of the in vivo role of fascin1 in innate and adaptive immunity against Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) infection could have a transformative effect on our understanding of host defense toward intracellular pathogens. Fascin1-expressing dendritic cells (DCs), by controlling intracellular proliferation of Lm and possibly other pathogens, are expected to effectively transfer pathogen information to T-cells, thereby leading to clearance of bacterial pathogens. We suggest that fascin1-expressing dendritic cells (DCs) could thus be utilized in DC-based immunotherapy.",Role Of Fascin1 In Dendritic Cell-Mediated Immunity Against Listeria Infection,2012,2014,"Matsumura, Fumio Yamashiro, Shigeko  ","Rutgers, The State Univ of N.j.",New Brunswick,NJ,35,1,-1,-1
5R01AI095667-02,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Giardia lamblia, a waterborne parasite, is responsible for intestinal infections in both developed and developing countries. Giardiasis, which is also a zoonotic disease, is transmitted via infective cysts through contaminated water. Exposures of cysts to gastric acid during passage through the human stomach trigger excystation, while factors in the small intestine, where trophozoites colonize, induce encystation or cyst formation. The hallmark of encystation is the biogenesis of encystation-specific vesicles (ESVs), which transport cyst-wall materials that later merge with the plasma membrane and lay down the cyst wall. However, it is not clear how ESV biogenesis is regulated and how viable or infective cysts are produced. Results from our laboratory have indicated that Giardia expresses fewer sphingolipid biosynthesis genes, which are differentially regulated during encystation. The overexpression of glucosylceramide transferase-1 (gGlcT1), one of the important enzymes of SL biosynthesis, produces enlarged and aggregated ESVs and alters cellular lipid homeostasis. The knockdown of gGlcT1, on the other hand, interferes with ESV formation that leads to the generation of cryptic cysts with reduced viability. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that the regulated expression of gGlcT1 is essential for ESV biogenesis and the production of infective cysts that transmit the disease. In Specific Aim 1, the mechanism by which gGlcT1 regulates lipid homeostasis and ESV biogenesis will be investigated using gGlcT1 overexpressed and knockdown Giardia. We will determine whether gGlcT1 coordinates with other enzymes of sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway to regulate ESV formation. The lipid components involved in assembly of functional ESVs will be identified by mass spectrometry and molecular/cellular methodologies. In Specific Aim 2, the role of gGlcT1 in regulating cyst morphology, viability, and infectivity will be determined. The biological activity and infectivity of cryptic cysts produced by gGlcT1 knockdown will be tested in in vitro excystation and in vivo animal model, respectively. The cyst- wall components that are responsible for altering cyst morphology and viability will be determined. The proposed study will identify gGlcT1 as a novel regulator of cyst formation by Giardia and could be exploited for the development of new therapies to control giardiasis, which affects millions of children worldwide each year.",Sphingolipid And Mechanism Of Cyst Formation By Giardia,2011,2016,"Das, Siddhartha ",University of Texas El Paso,El Paso,TX,51,1,-1,5309
5F32DK092054-02,National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,24,"Bacteria naturally associated with the host (commensals) limit disease caused by invading pathogens; however, the mechanisms utilized by beneficial microbes to inhibit pathogenesis are poorly understood. To elucidate the role of commensals in intestinal health, we use an animal model in which mice are colonized with the commensal microbe Bacillus subtilis prior to infection with the attaching and effacing (A/E) pathogen, Citrobacter rodentium. Gram positive spore-forming B. subtilis is present in mammalian gastrointestinal tracts and is safely consumed by humans. C. rodentium is genetically and functionally similar to the human A/E pathogens, enteropathogenic E. coli and enterohemorrhagic E. coli. Mice colonized with commensal wt B. subtilis prior to C. rodentium infection exhibited less diarrheal and intestinal disease than mice without B. subtilis. Further, we discovered that B. subtilis mutants unable to synthesize either an exopolysaccharide or flagellin do not protect the host from C. rodentium-associated disease. Bacterial exopolysaccharides and flagellin are ligands for the host receptors, TLR2 and TLR5, respectively. Since B. subtilis mutants deficient in these TLR ligands do not protect mice from C. rodentium-associated disease, we hypothesize that TLR signaling is required for B. subtilis-mediated protection. The innate immune response includes B1 lymphocytes which produce low affinity polyreactive natural antibodies. Natural antibodies can bind enteric pathogens and limit disease. Commensal colonization promotes B1 lymphocyte migration into the intestinal lamina propria. Commensal B. subtilis could promote the migration of natural antibody-producing B1 cells to the intestine and natural antibodies may limit intestinal inflammation by preventing C. rodentium from attaching to the gut epithelium. We hypothesize that natural antibody-producing B1 cells are required for B. subtilis-mediated protection from C. rodentium-associated disease. The goal of these studies is to determine if commensals require TLR signaling and host B1 lymphocytes to protect the host from C. rodentium-associated disease. To test these ideas, we will orally gavage specific-pathogen-free C57BL/6, TLR2 KO, TLR5 KO, and B1 lymphocyte depleted mice with wt B. subtilis and determine if susceptibility to C. rodentium infection is altered. We will also determine if B. subtilis colonization promotes migration of B1 cells into the intestinal lamina propria. Results from these studies will elucidate important commensal:host interactions that limit intestinal inflammation. Host:commensal interactions are critical for immune homeostasis and for limiting disease caused by invading pathogens. By improving our current knowledge of how commensals and the host cooperate to prevent inflammation, we could better utilize commensals to prevent disease induced by pathogenic bacteria.",B.

1R01AI097116-01,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Salmonella infections are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in both developed and developing nations. There are over 2600 serovars of Salmonella that exhibit a variety of host ranges and disease manifestations, which include gastroenteritis, bacteremia, metastatic infections and paratyphoid and typhoid fevers. In all cases, infection requires adaptation of the bacterium to distinct conditions of a number of host compartments, mediated in large part by changes in the expression of virulence and metabolism genes. Understanding these adaptations during the infection cycle is important for developing new strategies for preventing and treating infection. Although knowledge is limited, regulation of the virulence and metabolism genes of this organism are intricately linked through genetic circuitry involving SirA (Salmonella invasion regulator) and CsrA (carbon storage regulator). SirA is a DNA binding transcription factor that is the response regulator of the BarA-SirA two component signal transduction system. CsrA is an RNA binding protein that regulates mRNA translation and stability. CsrA activity is regulated by small noncoding RNAs (CsrB, CsrC), which sequester the CsrA protein. In turn, the transcription of csrB and csrC is activated by SirA. Regulation by this system responds to substrates and end products of carbon metabolism, which vary within host compartments, leading to the hypothesis that the status of carbon availability in large part governs adaptive transitions during the infection cycle. In Aim 1, a combination of genomic, bioinformatic, molecular genetic and biochemical approaches will be used to define the SirA and CsrA regulons, and thereby greatly increase our understanding of the regulatory links between metabolism and virulence. In Aim 2, several complementary approaches will be used to determine precisely when and where genes of this system are expressed and active during Salmonella infection of mice. This information will be evaluated in context with the regulons (defined in Aim 1) as well as the environmental and metabolic conditions that are known to influence these regulators in vitro. SirA and CsrA orthologs are highly conserved throughout the gamma-proteobacteria and are important for disease transmission and/or virulence in every species in which they have been examined. Thus, an understanding of the conditions and stimuli affecting SirA and CsrA activities and the mechanisms by which these proteins coordinate virulence and metabolic gene expression may be applicable to a broad range of pathogens.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Antibiotic therapies are relatively ineffective and are contraindicated for Salmonella gastrointestinal infections, which nevertheless have the potential to progress to life-threatening infections in infants and immunocompromised patients. Salmonella and many other species of bacteria utilize an ancient regulatory system to control metabolism and virulence.

5R01DK079215-05,National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,24,"Invasive gastroenteritis and enteric fever are major sources of mortality and morbidity worldwide. The initial steps in the pathogenesis of these syndromes involve a breach of the gastrointestinal epithelial barrier by virulent bacteria, colonization and growth in the intestinal tissue, and in some cases subsequent systemic spread to other organs via the lymphatics or blood stream. The receptors for epithelial cell invasion have been defined for several of these pathogens. However, many of these receptors for entry are not found on the luminal side of the intestine, but are instead abundant components of the basolateral membranes of epithelial cells. This implies that pathogens must first breach the epithelial tight junctions, or find alternative mechanisms to cross the epithelial barrier before reaching their receptors for epithelial invasion. We have proposed a novel model of intestinal invasion and colonization by the pathogen Listeria monocytogenes. We found that the tips of intestinal villi are a specialized site where the normal cell extrusion process allows basolateral receptors to be exposed at the luminal surface. Listeria monocytogenes finds E-cadherin, its receptor for entry, at these sites and invades the gastrointestinal epithelium of the villus tip. We propose to establish an oral model of Listeria gastrointestinal infection in Guinea pigs to test this model by characterizing the sites and kinetics of intestinal invasion and colonization. We will test the hypothesis that invasion of the cell extrusion zone results in asymptomatic carriage of Listeria in the gastrointestinal tract and study the relationship between this mode of invasion and systemic disease. Because of technical limitations found in Guinea pigs, we also propose to test whether genetic alterations in the Listeria invasin InlA can improve its interaction with murine E-cadherin, in order to develop a murine model of intestinal Listeriosis. In parallel with in vivo experiments, we will use cell culture experiments to define the mechanisms of endocytosis involved in internalization of Listeria at the cell extrusion zone. We will utilize polarized MDCK cell monolayers to test the hypothesis that Listeria take advantage of junction remodeling during invasion of the cell extrusion zone.Listeria monocytogenes has emerged as a significant cause of mortality due to food-borne illness in the United States, since it was responsible for 27.6% of deaths from enteric infection. Other important pathogens that invade the epithelium include rotavirus, Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia, enteroinvasive E. coli, and Campylobacter. How these organisms breach the gastrointestinal epithelial barrier is not clearly understood.

5R01AI042236-15,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"The outermost part of Gram-negative bacteria is the lipopolysaccharide (i.e. LPS). This molecule constitutes a permeability barrier that protects bacteria from a variety of noxious agents, and it is recognized by the host innate immune system of different animals and targeted by several natural antimicrobial peptides. Many Gram-negative pathogens have evolved mechanisms to modify their LPS in ways that decrease recognition by the host and increase resistance to antimicrobial peptides and certain toxic metals. In Salmonella enterica, which is the etiologic agent of typhoid fever and gastroenteritis, many of these LPS modifications are observed only under conditions that activate the PmrA/PmrB regulatory system. This proposal describes experiments aimed at understanding how the activity of the PmrA/PmrB system is dynamically controlled in response to internal and external inputs. Our studies will focus on a novel gene that encodes both a small peptide and small RNA, and on a set of Salmonella-specific genes that are required for survival inside macrophages. In addition, we will analyze the distinct properties that the PmrD protein plays in Salmonella, where it functions to activate the PmrA protein, and in the related species Escherichia coli, where it lacks this ability. We will examine whether the ability of commensal E. coli to colonize the mouse intestine is compromised when E. coli carries out the PmrA-controlled LPS modifications under inducing conditions that promote such activation in Salmonella. An accomplishment of these goals will uncover how the PmrA/PmrB system - a major regulator of LPS modifications in enteric bacteria - controls the remodeling of its cell surface in ways that protect it from antimicrobial insult.

5R01AI041930-14,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Toxoplasma gondii chronically infects approximately 30% of the USA population and causes severe life-threatening Toxoplasmic encephalitis infections in AIDS. Current drug treatments are not well tolerated, and because these treatments have little effect on the slow growing bradyzoite stages, latent parasites remain as a source of recrudescing infection in AIDS. More effective therapies that can target both tachyzoite and bradyzoite stages are urgently needed to treat acute infections as well as to prevent the toxoplasmosis caused by recrudescing parasites. Our preliminary studies have demonstrated that disruption of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase II (CPSII) in the de novo pyrimidine synthesis pathway causes a severe uracil auxotrophy with a corresponding loss of parasite growth and virulence. Consequently the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway appears to be an excellent target for intervention, and fundamental studies on pyrimidine acquisition have the potential to identify new targets. Due to the need for uridine monophosphate in all life stages, we hypothesize that pyrimidine biosynthesis is necessary to sustain rapid tachyzoite replication as well as the viability of bradyzoites within tissue cysts. We propose to use a combination of genetic, biochemical, and cell biological approaches to better understand the fundamental biology of de novo pyrimidine synthesis and salvage pathways in T. gondii. Inhibitors of pyrimidine biosynthesis will be identified based on a screening strategy of pyrimidine auxotrophy. The information and reagents developed in our studies will be used to validate significant drug targets in the pathway as well as to validate the target(s) of inhibitors identified in this project.

5R37AI036929-19,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Listeria monocytogenes is a ubiquitous Gram-positive bacterium that can cause serious food-borne infections in pregnant women, newborns and immunocompromised or older adults. Some patients develop infections in the central nervous system because of the unusual ability of L. monocytogenes to breach the blood-brain barrier. The bacterium grows directly in the cytoplasm of infected host cells and moves rapidly throughout and between infected cells using a form of actin-based motility. The L. monocytogenes surface protein, ActA, is expressed in a polarized fashion and interacts with host cell cytoskeletal factors to induce the polymerization of an actin comet tail structure that pushes the bacterium through the host cell cytoplasm. The overall goal of this project is to understand the mechanism and biological significance of the actin-based motility of L. monocytogenes. We propose to use an interdisciplinary approach to studying this form of motility at all levels from the biochemistry and biophysics of single molecules involved in the generation of actin-based motility to the dynamics of spread across the blood-brain barrier in infected animals. At the MOLECULAR level, we will determine the minimal functional unit for actin comet tail assembly. At the level of the BACTERIAL CELL, we will establish how ActA localization is determined by bacterial cell wall synthesis and remodeling, and measure the effects of ActA mislocalization on actin comet tail formation and motility. At the level of the HOST CELL, we will identify host cell components that contribute specifically to the process of cell- to-cell spread, and elucidate the possible mechanisms by which bacteria can cross endothelial monolayers. At the level of the HOST ANIMAL, we will determine how the bacteria cross the blood-brain barrier in a newly developed mouse model of systemic infection. Successful completion of our research goals would give significant insight into the mechanisms by which pathogenic bacteria such as L. monocytogenes communicate specifically with the cells of their human hosts to subvert host cell function in favor of bacterial propagation and dissemination. In addition, because L. monocytogenes actin-based motility is a simple model system for force generation by actin polymerization, the results of our research would contribute to our understanding of a wide variety of basic biological processes involving actin-based cell movement, including wound healing, inflammation, embryonic development, and cancer metastasis.

5U19AI044236-14,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"In order for food allergens to initiate an allergic response throughout the body, they must first traffic across  the single layer of columnar epithelial cells that line the gastrointestinal tract. We have recently shown that a  facilitated antigen sampling mechanism occurs whereby IgE in the intestinal lumen binds to antigens and can  be trafficked as a complex across the epithelium by the low-affinity IgE receptor CD23. These antigen-lgE  complexes can then act of effector cells such as mast cells, leading to degranulation and alteration of normal  physiology of the gut, lung, or skin. In addition, we have shown that subjects with food allergy have  detectable CD23 and food-specific IgE levels in the stool, which non-atopic controls do not. We hypothesize  that the CD23-mediated uptake mechanism is a critical step in the pathophysiology of food allergy, and  appearance of CD23 and IgE in the stool may be a useful non-invasive biomarker of food allergic disease.  In these proposed experiments, we will examine the use of stool CD23 as a biomarker in food allergy.  We will measure stool CD23 in a group of 110 milk-sensitized individuals and determine if stool CD23 is  associated with clinical reactivity to milk.

The First Aim is to develop molecules that inhibit formation of the orange carotenoid virulence factor, staphyloxanthin, in Staphylococcus aureus. In recent work, we discovered that human squalene synthase inhibitors can also block staphyloxanthin biosynthesis in S. aureus, at 200 nM levels. The resulting S. aureus (L. aureus=golden) are white, non-infective in mice and are killed by neutrophils, since they have decreased defenses to reactive oxygen species. In Aim 1, we will develop more effective compounds, using NMR, X-ray and QSAR results to guide the design process. If successful, this work would be of importance given the increasing number S. aureus strains that are becoming resistant to conventional antibiotics. The Second Aim is to develop the azole class of molecules currently used as anti-fungals, as agents against S. aureus, blocking bacterial flavohemoglobin dioxygenase (which detoxifies NO from innate immune cells), as well as affecting isoprenoid biosynthesis. We will first investigate how azoles bind to flavohemoglobin and deduce structure-activity relationships that will guide the design of other, more potent inhibitors. Second, we will investigate how azoles exert their direct anti-bacterial activity. We propose to test the hypothesis that this activity is a result of the inhibition of isoprenoid biosynthesis, by correlating isoprenoid levels with anti-bacterial activity, and by using microarray techniques to investigate the bacterial transcriptome. If successful, this work would lead to novel azoles that inhibit bacterial defenses against NO-based killing, as well as new compounds that inhibit bacterial cell wall biosynthesis. The Third Aim is to develop bisphosphonates that activate ?? T cells of the innate immune system to kill bacteria, in addition to developing novel bisphosphonates that kill bacteria directly. In each Aim, we will use the strategy of developing alternate uses for existing types of drugs already used or tested in humans: cholesterol lowering drugs that block virulence in S. aureus (Aim 1), anti-fungal azoles with anti- bacterial activity (Aim 2) and bone resorption drugs that have immunomodulation or direct anti- bacterial activity (Aim 3).In addition, in two or three sentences, describe in plain, lay language the relevance of this research to public health.

The absorption of Stx across the intestinal barrier is poorly understood. Given that the epithelial cytoskeleton is integral to the regulation of transcytotic and paracellular transport, Stx translocation may be facilitated by the ability of EHEC to dramatically alter host filamentous (F-) actin. EHEC, along with enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) and the natural mouse pathogen Citrobacter rodentium, trigger the formation of attaching and effacing (AE) lesions on epithelial cells. These lesions are characterized by intimate attachment and rearrangement of F-actin to form pedestals beneath bound bacteria. The ability to generate AE lesions requires the type III translocation of bacterial effector proteins, and the effectors Tir and EspFU have been implicated in the formation of actin pedestals. In addition, EspFU can promote the disruption of epithelial barriers in vitro. We identified the activities of Tir and EspFU required for pedestal formation and have isolated numerous mutants that are incapable of promoting localized actin assembly. Recently, to examine the pathogenesis of Stx-mediated disease, we generated a murine model for EHEC infection utilizing C. rodentium lysogenized with a phage encoding Stx2, an allele of Stx particularly associated with HUS. Mice infected with C. rodentium (?Stx2) suffer Stx-dependent renal damage, weight loss and eventual death. We have also constructed derivatives of C. rodentium (?Stx2) that express EHEC virulence factors, including Tir and/or EspFU, and a pilot experiment was suggestive that the ability to generate cytoskeletal changes may enhance virulence in this model. To test the hypothesis that EHEC mediated actin rearrangement contributes to the disruption of intestinal epithelial barrier function and enhancement of Stx-mediated disease, we will pursue the following aims:    1.Assess the ability of EHEC-mediated actin rearrangement to enhance Stx2 translocation across polarized epithelial cells in vitro. Polarized monolayers will be infected with (a non-Stx- producing) EHEC expressing wild type Tir and EspFU, or with derivatives that are incapable of triggering actin rearrangement. Purified Stx2d will be added to the apical surface and its translocation across infected monolayers of T84 intestinal epithelial cells will be measured.    2. Assess the ability of EspFU to enhance Stx2-mediated disease in a mouse model for EHEC.  Mice will be orally infected with C. rodentium (?Stx2) expressing wild type TirEHEC and EspFU, or with derivatives of these effectors that specifically lack activities required for triggering actin rearrangement. Bacterial colonization, intestinal permeability, and systemic disease will be assessed.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O157:H7 is an important food-borne pathogen in North America, Europe and Japan (79). The life-threatening systemic manifestations of infection are due to the absorption of bacterial toxin from the intestine (51, 52). EHEC binds to cells of the gut wall and triggers the host cell to generate striking pedestal-like structures beneath bound bacteria (33), a process that may promote the absorption of toxin into the mammalian bloodstream. These studies investigate whether the ability of EHEC to induce pedestals promotes systemic disease.",EHEC-Induced Actin Rearrangement And Stx2 Translocation Across Epithelium,2011,2013,"Leong, John M",Tufts University Boston,Boston,MA,26,1,-1,1495
1R21AI102106-01,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"There is an urgent need for new therapeutics to effectively target drug-resistant microbes and pathogens that currently have no treatment options. Noroviruses cause an estimated 23 million infections and over half of all food-borne gastroenteritis outbreaks in the US every year yet no antivirals or vaccines exist to treat or prevent infections. Listeria monocytogenes is another food-borne pathogen with a 20 - 25% fatality rate, responsible for recent cantaloupe-associated food-borne infection outbreaks. There is a compelling rationale for developing broad-spectrum therapeutics for early and effective treatment of infectious diseases. One approach towards that goal is development of anti-infective compounds that target host-encoded proteins critical during pathogen infection.  Ubiquitin is a eukaryotic low molecular weight polypeptide that acts as a post-translational regulatory switch when covalently linked to target proteins.  This application provides preliminary data showing a small molecule, WP1130 (WP) and related compounds have anti-infective activity against different classes of pathogens, including: category B bacteria (MRSA, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium); viruses (murine and human norovirus, encephalomyocarditis virus, Sindbis virus, La Crosse virus); and an apicomplexan parasite (Toxoplasma gondii).  WP inhibits a subset of host cell deubiquitinases (DUBs), causing accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins.  Pathogens outside the host are not affected.  Studies using WP analogs provide vital clues for development of novel therapeutics that may effectively control pathogens by interfering with key host and microbe interactions. Ubiquitination and deubiquination of host targets have critical roles in many microbial infections.  We hypothesize that WP can limit infection by selectively inhibiting DUBs exploited by microbial pathogens. We will use murine norovirus and L. monocytogenes and established small animal models of infection to define DUB targets that mediate the anti-infective effects of WP. Our goal is to select lead compound to be utilized in an investigational new drug (IND) application. We propose the following specific aims: (1) Determine target DUBs of WP that mediate anti-infective activity, (2) Test a SAR series of WP in vitro to identify lead compounds, and (3) Test lead compounds for in vivo efficacy. This application proposes to develop broad-spectrum anti-infective therapeutics that have efficacy against many pathogens including multiple category B agents.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Infectious agents are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States today.  The emergence of drug resistant organisms is a major public health concern.

5R03AI094245-02,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Gene regulation plays a critical role in the virulence of pathogenic bacteria. Our long-term goal is to understand how transcription factors (TFs) regulate virulence processes in the pathogenic species, Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC). ETEC is the leading bacterial cause of diarrhea in the developing world and causes >300,000 deaths annually, mainly in children. Many virulence genes have been identified in ETEC but relatively little is known about regulation of these genes. We have recently identified a TF, RoaA, encoded on one of the ETEC virulence plasmids, that is required for efficient adhesion to gut epithelial cells. We hypothesize that RoaA is a key regulator of ETEC virulence. The goal of this proposal is to comprehensively identify the regulatory targets of RoaA with nucleotide resolution. We will use complementary genomic approaches, ChIP-seq and RNA-seq, to identify direct and indirect regulatory targets. We will determine which of the target genes are required for ETEC virulence. We will then use genetic and biochemical analyses to identify the precise DNA sites for RoaA at the promoters of these genes. The proposed work will provide important insight into the regulation of ETEC virulence genes, and will form the foundation of future studies of ETEC virulence.

5K01DK082725-05,National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,24,"IL-10 is a critical cytokine for homeostatic responses in the intestinal mucosa, both against orally ingested antigens and against commensal microflora. IL-10 can exert its effects through the induction of DC that prime tolerogenic responses, referred to as tolerogenic DC. It is proposed that tolerogenic DC prime type-1 regulatory (Tr1) cells, a subset of T cell that produce high amounts of IL-10 and suppress inflammation. However, the molecular mechanism of tolerogenic DC and (Tr1) cell generation in the intestine remain poorly understood. The goal of this proposal is to determine how IL-10-producing cells are generated in the intestinal immune tissue using Y. enterocolitica infection as a model system. What makes Y. enterocolitica an ideal choice for examining induction of IL-10-mediated mucosal responses is because of its tropism for immune sites of the small intestine, specifically the Peyer's patches and the MLN, both sites of immune cell induction and T cell priming. More importantly, Y. enterocolitica harbors the Low Calcium Response V Antigen (LcrV) an essential virulence factor found in all three pathogenic Yersinia species and which has been shown to induce IL-10 from antigen presenting cells (APC). Using systemic Y. pestis infection we found that LcrV induced tolerogenic DC and primed a Tr1 cell response in a TLR6 dependent manner. Furthermore, our initial studies suggest that TLR6 is uniquely involved in the generation of tolerogenic DC and Tr1 through activation of the MAPK JNK. We hypothesize that TLR6 and JNK will play a key role in the generation of mucosal intestinal tolerogenic DC and Tr1 cells. Furthermore, we anticipate that TLR6 and JNK play an important role in Y. enterocolitica pathogenesis. Our specific aims will investigate [sic], 1) Evaluate the induction of tolerogenic DC and Tr1 cells using mucosal DC from TLR-deficient and JNK-deficient mice stimulated in vitro by LcrV or infected with Y. enterocolitica. 2) Evaluate the role TLR6 and JNK play during pathogenesis of oral Y. enterocolitica infection. In this aim we will utilize knockout mice as well as by using IL-10-T cell reporter mice bred to TLR-deficient and JNK-deficient mice in hopes to identify the mucosal sites of IL-10 induction and evaluate whether mucosal CD4 T cells induced during infection can transfer tolerance and spread tolerance to a second antigen. 3) Use monoclonal antibodies against LcrV and LcrV deletion mutants to identify specific residues within LcrV responsible for inducing IL-10 and activating JNK.   PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Understanding the molecular mechanism that Y. enterocolitica induces intestinal Tr1 and tolerogenic DC, may give us critical insight into understanding how intestinal tissue generates regulatory responses homeostatically.",Role Of JNK2 And TLR6 During Y.

5R01NS060034-05,National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke,96,"Prion diseases are inevitably fatal, transmissible disorders inducing a progressive neurologic dysfunction after a prolonged incubation period. Oral transmission is the primary route of infection for BSE, scrapie and TME and is the suspected route of transmission for vCJD and CWD. TSEs share several hallmark characteristics including the accumulation of a disease-specific structurally abnormal form of the prion protein (PrPSc). We have recently demonstrated that prions bind to soil, clay minerals and silicon dioxide (Johnson et al., 2007). We have analyzed the binding of PrPSc to montmorillonite clay (Mte) and found it to be extremely avid. When laboratory animals are orally challenged with PrPSc bound to Mte, more animals succumbed to disease with shorter incubation periods than were observed with just PrPSc. Survival analysis of oral transmission experiments demonstrate that prions bound to clay are approximately 700 times more orally transmissible than unbound agent (Johnson et al., 2007). Whole soils have a similar effect; two of three tested soils enhance transmission and the third is no less infectious than unbound PrPSc (Johnson et al., 2007). Our studies support the hypothesis that soil and soil microparticles bind to prion protein (PrPSc) enhancing disease transmission for scrapie and CWD. In this application, we propose to examine the effect of soil microparticles on CWD transmission in deer (SA1). These studies will emphasize whole soils, their ability to bind CWD agent and the impact of this interaction on CWD disease transmission. In SA2, we will determine the mechanism(s) by which clay-bound prions have increased orally transmissible by examining the resistance to degradation, uptake of clay-bound agent and the aggregation state and other biophysical parameters of PrPSc bound to clay. Microparticles are found in many other substances than soil. Meat and bone meal (MBM), a commonly used cattle food supplement thought responsible for BSE in Europe. We present data demonstrating MBM is rich in microparticles and will test if MBM-associated agent enhances oral transmissibility similar to Mte. Finally we will determine if endogenous calcium (Ca) phosphate microparticles, formed in the intestine, promote TSE infection. These studies will assess the infectivity of TSE agent sorbed to Ca phosphate and examining oral infectivity in animals with reduced Ca content. We hypothesize that animals with reduced Ca phosphate microparticles will be less susceptible to TSE infection and that agent sorption to intestinal calcium phosphate represents a step in the pathway by which oral TSE infections in initiated. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prion diseases are transmissible neurologic disorders that can affect animals (sheep scrapie, cervid chronic wasting disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy) and humans (Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and Kuru). The potential for the environment to maintain and become a source of infectivity for sheep scrapie and cervid CWD is well documented and, undoubtedly, involves oral transmission of low levels of infectious agent. Since oral transmission is, in general, not an efficient means of infecting susceptible animals, we hypothesize a role for soil in the enhancement of oral transmission.

5R01AI021423-27,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"One of the most remarkable features of the obligate intracellular parasite, Toxoplasma gondii, is its ability to infect almost any nucleated cell in an extremely broad host range. During asexual growth in such cells, the parasite can adopt either of two forms: the rapidly dividing tachyzoite and the more slowly growing encysted form, the bradyzoite. This application addresses the molecular basis of the interaction between the tachyzoite form and the individual host cells in which it resides. Key to this interaction are a set of highly specialized secretory organelles known as rhoptries. These club-shaped structures are found at the apical end of all members of the Apicomplexa, including the causative agent of human malaria, Plasmodium. The rhoptries release their contents when these parasites invade into a host cell and this release appears key to both the physical act of invasion as well as to the co-opting of host cell functions once the parasite is inside.  Recent work has shown that rhoptry neck proteins (RONs) help create the ring of physical contact between the host cell and invading parasite, the so-called moving junction. Rhoptry bulb proteins (ROPs), on the other hand appear to function within the cytosol/nucleus of the infected cell as well as on the parasitophorous vacuole that surrounds the dividing parasites. The work described in this application will determine how key RONs and ROPs perform their critical functions including identification of their location and topology and the host pathways/proteins with which they interact.

The early inflammatory response elicited by S. typhimurium is beneficial to the host because it confines the infection to the gut mucosa. However, aspects of this response are also beneficial to S. typhimurium as they are exploited to successfully colonize the gut and achieve transmission to the next susceptible host. Very little is known about which mucosal inflammatory responses constitute the mucosal barrier to systemic Salmonella dissemination and which are exploited by Salmonella to colonize the gut. Our long-range goal is to understand how the intestinal mucosal barrier functions as well as how it is altered in individuals at higher risk for systemic infections. The objectives of this application are to investigate the costs and benefits of mucosal inflammation during Salmonella pathogenesis. Our central hypothesis is that a subset of cytokines, namely the TH17 cytokines, orchestrates both the mucosal barrier function that prevents systemic S. typhimurium dissemination and the inflammatory responses that are exploited by S. typhimurium and other bacteria to survive in the inflamed gut. The rationale for the proposed research is that understanding the host-pathogen interaction at the mucosal interface will lead to innovative approaches to treat and prevent infections at mucosal surfaces and to reduce the risk of bacteremia. We plan to test our hypothesis and fulfill the objectives of this application by pursuing the following specific aims: 1. Determine which components of the inflammatory response constitute the gut mucosal barrier during S. typhimurium infection. We will investigate the role of IL-17 and IL-22 in orchestrating the mucosal barrier during S. typhimurium infection. 2.

Infectious and inflammatory diseases cause the down-regulation of many P450s and other drug metabolizing enzymes in the liver, causing impairment of drug clearances. In mice infected with C. rodentium, a model of E. Coli food poisoning in humans, a number of P450 enzymes in the liver are moderately down-regulated. However, CYP4A enzymes are more profoundly affected, as is another drug metabolizing enzyme, i.e. flavin monooxygenase 3 (FMO3). Preliminary evidence suggests that one or more bacterially secreted factors regulate hepatic CYP4A expression in an endotoxin-independent manner. CYP4As have important roles in fatty acid metabolism, control of blood pressure and in oxidative stress. Therefore, it is important to understand how human CYP4A11 is regulated during infection, and to understand whether on not CYP4A regulation is a defensive or adaptive response of the host, or if the invading bacterium could be regulating CYP4As to its own advantage. To address these questions, the regulation of CYP4A11 will be studied in the livers and kidneys of CYP4A11 transgenic mice during C. rodentium infection. This will be complemented by studies in cultured human hepatocytes and in CYP4A11 transgenic mouse hepatocytes, on CYP4A11 regulation by inflammatory cytokines and bacterial products. Transcriptional and proteomic profiling will be used to assess the effects of infection on global gene expression in the liver and to elucidate signaling networks involved in CYP4A and FMO3 down-regulation by factors secreted by bacteria. To identify these factor(s) we will screen known mutants and, if necessary, an enteropathogenic E. coli transposon insertion library to identify mutants that fail to down-regulate these enzymes. This approach will be complemented by biochemical characterization and partial purification of the factor(s). To elucidate the role of CYP4A enzymes in the host response to C. rodentium infection, or as targets of the bacterium's strategy for propagation and survival, the effects will be studied of Cyp4A10-/- and Cyp4A14-/- gene deletion on the pathologies associated with C. rodentium infection.

It is possible that if the Salmonella lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is truncated further, this may result in more effective presentation of conserved outer membrane proteins (OMPs) to the host immune system, which will lead to an immune response that is cross protective against a number of other Salmonella species and to other Gram- negative enteric pathogens. In addition, exposure of the fairly conserved core oligosaccharide and enhanced production of outer membrane vesicles may also aid in production of a cross-protective immune response. In this proposal, we will construct a series of mutations to achieve regulated O-antigen or core synthesis such that full length LPS is present at the time of immunization but is lost after colonization of the host.

TZUs demonstrate bactericidal activity, oral bioavailability, in vivo efficacy, a low propensity for toxicity and a low rate of spontaneous resistance. TZUs inhibit a novel bacterial target, thereby circumventing existing mechanisms of antibiotic resistance. We have made compelling progress during Phase I, having already met several key goals. In particular, we have identified several TZUs with in vitro potency exceeding that of linezolid, the only orally active drug approved for MRSA. We seek Phase II funding to enable completion of pivotal studies required for filing of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application. The research plan is divided into three stages. Aim 1 focuses on in-depth characterization of three top TZUs; each exhibits key attributes including in vivo efficacy following oral administration and outstanding microbiological potency. Aim 1 studies will include in vivo pharmacodynamics (PD) dose response studies, determination of pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters in two species, determination of the PK-PD index, evaluation of in vitro and in vivo toxicity, and determination of rates of resistance development. Based on these results, the TZU that best exemplifies the target product profile will be selected as the IND candidate. In Aim 2, process chemistry work will commence, focusing on improving synthetic yields, lowering cost, and making the synthetic process more scalable (e.g., by elimination of chromatographic steps). At this stage, the goal will be to develop a synthetic route appropriate for 1-10 kilogram scale synthesis at a cost of less than $25,000 per kg. Exploratory toxicology and toxicokinetic studies will be performed under non-GLP conditions in two species to support dose selection, toxicology endpoints and toxicokinetic time points for GLP-compliant studies. Analytical and bioanalytical methods will be validated under Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) conditions. Comprehensive microbiological characterization will be performed, including MIC90 testing in several Gram-positive species, evaluation of cross-resistance, post antibiotic effect (PAE) and synergy with other antibiotics. In Aim 3, a 5-10 kg GLP-toxicology batch will be synthesized, and GLP-compliant toxicology and safety pharmacology studies will be performed.

Currently there is no effective therapy for this group of diseases. The outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy and the resulting emergence of a new human prion disease vCJD, highlight the public health threat from prion diseases. Although the original outbreak of vCJD is waning, there is the possibility of further outbreaks from current asymptomatic carriers of the disease. In the USA an ongoing threat from prion disease is from chronic wasting disease (CWD). High rates of infection among deer and elk populations have been report, with experimental data indicating that this disease is transmissible to primates. In the prior funding of this grant we reported on the first successful in vivo active and passive immunization approaches for prion diseases using wild-type animals. In the last funding cycle we also developed an in vitro tissue culture model of prion disease, and showed that it is a valuable tool to screen for therapeutically active anti-PrP antibodies. Our recent preliminary results indicate that using our novel mucosal immunization approach we are able to completely prevent prion disease among animals with a high anti-PrP titer. We also have shown that anti-PrP antibodies that are active in our tissue culture model of prion infection, can significantly delay prion infection and reduce severity of disease. In our planned studies we will further develop our active and passive immunization approaches, to bring them closer to veterinary and human clinical use for both prion infection prevention and potential treatment of symptomatic disease. The specific aims of this proposal are to : 1): Development of the optimal oral vaccination method in wild-type mice and transgenic mice expressing elk, sheep or human PrP; 2) Characterization of the immune response in successfully vaccinated animals and the development of monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) to mouse and human PrP from these mice. Mabs will be tested for therapeutic efficacy in tissue culture models of scrapie and human sporadic CJD prion infection and 3) Passive immunization studies using existing Mabs and antibodies generated from successfully vaccinated mice to determine the mechanisms responsible for therapeutic effects and to investigate if any will be effective in both human and scrapie prion infection in the pre- symptomatic incubation period and in symptomatic disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Currently prion diseases are without treatment and are universally fatal. The past outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy with the resulting emergence of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, as well as the currently epidemic of chronic wasting disease among deer and elk in the USA, which has been shown to be transmissible to primates, all highlights the threat of this group of disorders.

Mammalian prions tend to accumulate at high levels in the nervous system, causing fatal neurodegeneration. The most common form of human prion disorders is sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD). The origin, spectrum, and structure of sCJD prions are unknown. The extraordinary phenotypic variability of the disease suggests the existence of many different conformers of pathogenic prion protein (PrPSc) coding for distinct CJD prion strains. Moreover, the co-existence of different proteolytic fragments of PrPSc in approximately 40% of sCJD brains has raised the intriguing possibility that conformationally distinct sCJD prions coexist in the same host. This, in turn, raises fundamental questions about the origin of sCJD prions, their evolution and hypothetical interference. The focus of this application is to decipher the conformation of PrPSc in sCJD patients and to elucidate the mechanism underlying the replication of human prions. Novel conformational methods in tandem with protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) and conformation-dependent immunoassay (CDI) will be used to identify the conformations and critical domains in human PrPSc that code for different strains of sCJD prions. The analysis of hydrogen/deuterium exchange in brain-derived PrPSc and PrPSc-like conformers amplified in vitro by PMCA, together with site-directed spin labeling strategy, should allow us to elucidate the strain- dependent conformational mechanism in the replication of natural sCJD prions. Furthermore, measurements of replication rates of sCJD prions with tandem CDI and PMCA combined with structural data should determine the specific conformational features of brain PrPSc that modulate replication rates and thus the progression rate of the disease. The ultimate goal of these studies is to advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing the replication of human prion strains and the impact of PrPSc conformation upon the sCJD phenotype and transmissibility of the disease.

2R01AI045746-11A1,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Knowledge is very limited with respect to how facultative pathogens, i.e., pathogens that spend portions of their life cycles both inside and outside of the human body, adapt to drastically changing conditions when passing from a human host into an environmental reservoir. Advances in understanding of the basic mechanisms of adaptation during this transition are needed to provide new molecular targets and strategies for limiting transmission, dissemination and environmental persistence, and thus reduce the large medical burden imposed by this diverse group of pathogens. In the facultative, water-borne pathogen Vibrio cholerae (the causative agent of cholera), signaling by the intracellular secondary messenger molecule cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP) leads to the repression of virulence genes, and at the same time, the induction of environmental survival genes. At a late stage of infection, just prior to excretion of V. cholerae in watery stool, expression of three genes that encode c-di-GMP synthetases is induced, leading to the hypothesize that c-di-GMP mediates the transition from a state of virulence to one of environmental suitability. In this project the role of c-di- GMP in the biology of V. cholerae late in infection and in the process of dissemination will be determined using genetic and biochemical methods, including some novel methods created for these studies. In addition, the roles of a family of five c-di-GMP-binding proteins in transducing the c-di- GMP signal into biological changes will be determined. It is anticipated that this work will provide a working model of the central regulatory pathway in V. cholerae that represses virulence gene expression and induces expression of genes important for dissemination. It is also anticipated that these studies will have application to a broad range of bacterial pathogens since most contain multiple c-di-GMP synthetic, degradative and sensory proteins.

1R01AI099451-01,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Rotavirus (RV) is a leading global cause of childhood diarrhea. Current attenuated human RV (AttHRV) oral vaccines are effective in infants in developed countries, but for unexplained reasons, they lack efficacy in impoverished countries where diarrhea mortality is highest. Alternative affordable strategies are urgently needed to reduce diarrheal diseases and enhance oral vaccine efficacy. Malnutrition (kwashiorkor) and frequent antibiotic usage in infants affect the gut microbiome and barrier integrity, likely compromising gut immunity and predisposing infants to diarrheal illness, but their impact on HRV infection is uncharacterized. Studies of gnotobiotic (Gn) animals have revealed that probiotics or commensal microflora are crucial for gut immune maturation and homeostasis, but the mechanisms involved and their roles in modulating viral diarrheas or enhancing oral vaccine efficacy are unclear. Neonates undergo progressive changes in the gut microflora which we will model by colonizing Gn pigs with Lactobacillus spp (Gram, G+), E. coli (G- ), both, or a commensal cocktail from conventional piglets. Gn pigs resemble infants in size, anatomy, physiology, development of mucosal immunity and are the only animal model susceptible to HRV diarrhea. Our investigation of how the selected probiotics/commensals modulate gut homeostasis and immune responses and impact enteric diseases and vaccines will permit their rational use as biotherapeutic agents and/or adjuvants. We hypothesize that selected G+ and G- gut microflora will modulate different host cellular pathways leading to immunostimulatory, but balanced (Th1/Th2/Th17/Treg) responses that enhance efficacy of RV vaccines or immuno-regulatory (Treg) responses that moderate HRV diarrhea. Further, humanized, outbred Gn pigs are a unique model to study how microbiota and diet contribute to malnutrition and HRV disease severity under conditions that constrain confounding variables in ways not possible in infants. In Aim 1, we determine how selected G+ or G- probiotics, both, or the commensal cocktail modulates immune responses, gut homeostasis and HRV pathogenicity. Then we test the impact of antibiotics on the commensal microflora and on these same parameters. In Aim 2, we determine how defined probiotics or commensals modulate protective immunity to AttHRV oral vaccine. In Aim 3, in collaboration with Jeff Gordon, we develop a humanized Gn pig model to study the interaction of microbiota x diet (from African twins discordant for kwashiorkor) on severe malnutrition and HRV pathogenicity and identify microbial biomarkers to aid in vaccine design or therapeutic interventions. Effects of the probiotics/commensals/microbiota will be compared by intestinal transcriptome profiling (pig microarrays, 44K ESTs), metagenomics, metabolomics and metatranscriptomics, gut barrier integrity (sugar permeability, tight junction genes, serum LPS), and induction of innate and adaptive immune responses, to establish the immunoregulatory/immunostimulatory profiles. Our innovative studies will address gaps in knowledge of gut immune maturation and homeostasis and interactions between gut microflora and enteropathogenic viruses or oral vaccines.

PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Human rotavirus (HRV) is a leading cause of childhood diarrhea worldwide. The high costs and unexplained low effectiveness of licensed oral HRV vaccines in infants in impoverished countries remain obstacles to their universal adoption. Alternative low cost treatments to moderate HRV disease and enhance effectiveness of RV and other oral vaccines are needed to reduce infant diarrheal diseases and deaths. A balanced, healthy gut microflora containing Gram positive (Lactobacillus sp) and Gram negative (E. coli) bacteria plays a crucial role in maturation of the neonatal intestinal and systemic immune systems. It is also critical for development of post-natal immune competence and resistance to infectious diseases or allergic and inflammatory bowel syndromes. Our goal is to use harmless probiotic or commensal microbes to confer beneficial effects to infant health via immune stimulation (pro-inflammatory strains to enhance vaccines) or immune regulation [anti-inflammatory strains to reduce inflammation (diarrhea, allergies, inflammatory bowel diseases)]. Our unique germfree (GF) pig model is derived free of confounding microbes and maternal antibodies. Neonatal GF pigs resemble infants in size, physiology, anatomy, susceptibility to HRV diarrhea and development of mucosal immunity.

Factors such as antibiotics and diet (malnutrition) can disrupt the gut microflora, influencing susceptibility to diarrheal diseases and the effectiveness of oral vaccines, but in undefined ways. Using the GF pig model, we will determine the impact of antibiotic treatment, commonly used in infants and children, on the gut microflora, neonatal immune responses and the severity of HRV diarrhea. With our collaborator, we will further develop a humanized GF pig model (transplanted microflora from African twins) to define the role of microflora and native diet  on the development of severe forms of malnutrition such as kwashiorkor, seen in African children. We will then explore how severe malnutrition affects diarrhea and deaths associated with HRV, to discern the basis for the disproportionately high mortality rates in HRV-infected children in developing countries.

Infection with EAEC is associated with malnutrition and weight loss in children. In HIV-infected patients, even with antiretroviral therapy (ART), malnutrition and weight loss are important predictors of mortality. Establishing factors that contribute to malnutrition and weight loss in HIV-infected patients is essential. EAEC may play a role, but currently the impacts of EAEC infection on HIV-infected patients treated with ART are not clear nor are there established management strategies.  I recently evaluated stool samples from patients in a case-control study in Port au Prince. For the first time, EAEC was the most commonly identified pathogen in Haitian AIDS patients with diarrhea. In addition, EAEC was associated with weight loss in the first month of therapy. The proposed study will carefully examine EAEC infection in HIV-infected adults initiating ART. I hypothesize that patients with diarrhea who are infected with EAEC will have worse clinical outcomes when compared to patients with diarrhea but uninfected with EAEC and to those without diarrhea. The primary outcome will be % of patients in each group with weight loss at one month, an important predictor of mortality. Secondary outcomes will include survival to 48 weeks. In addition, I will evaluate whether bacterial and patient genotypes correlate with outcomes. The factors evaluated will include the prevalence of genes encoding bacterial virulence factors, the production of bacterial biofilm, the prevalence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) that confer susceptibility to EAEC infection in the patients, and patient production of intestinal inflammatory markers.  In the first three years of the award, I will pursue training in the evaluation of bacterial causes and host responses to enteric infections and in clinical trial design and research ethics in resource-limited settings. The sponsor and cosponsor have significant experience in these areas and will guide this training. Concurrently, I will build on established relationships with Haitian colleagues to set up and carry out the proposed study.

They are one of the six most dangerous potential bioterrorism threats and are also utilized to treat a variety of human diseases ranging from muscle spasms to chronic pain. BoNTs are known to act by cleaving neuronal proteins essential for synaptic vesicle exocytosis, thereby blocking neurotransmission. Because neurotransmission is not required for survival of neuronal cells, BoNTs are considered not to have any cytotoxicity to neuronal cells. However, a significant portion of patients surviving severe botulism have reported persistent residual symptoms, raising the possibility that BoNTs may have additional long-term adverse effects in neurons beyond their acute action on synaptic vesicle exocytosis. Indeed, our preliminary studies indicated that members of the BoNTs can induce degeneration of neurons. These findings raise the need to investigate the potential cytotoxic effects of BoNTs on neurons in order to fully understand the long-term effects of botulism and to ensure the safe use of BoNTs. Here we propose to carry out the first in-depth study to investigate the cytotoxicity of BoNTs at the molecular and cellular levels. Using cultured hippocampal neurons as a cell model, we will first screen all known BoNTs to identify the ones that can induce degeneration of neurons. We will then evaluate the physiological and human relevance of their cytotoxicity using rodent motor neuron models in vitro and in vivo, and human motor neurons derived from embryonic stem cells. Finally, we will define the molecular basis for BoNT-induced neurodegeneration by identifying the toxin-target proteins and determining the essential cellular process whose disruption leads to neurodegeneration. These proposed studies will uncover and characterize a novel long-term consequence of BoNT action in neurons and lay the foundation for understanding a critical cellular process essential for neuronal survival.",Cytotoxicity Of Botulinum Neurotoxins,2012,2014,"Dong, Min ",Harvard Medical School,Boston,MA,26,1,-1,5642
5R01AI049978-10,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"The ability to invade non-phagocytic host cells is essential for Salmonella virulence. SipA, SipC, SopB, SopE, and SopE2 are five type III effectors that are known to promote Salmonella invasion by modulating host actin dynamics both directly and indirectly. SipA and SipC regulate actin dynamics directly by mimicking functions of host actin-binding proteins. Indirectly, SopB, SopE, and SopE2 subvert host cell signal transduction pathways to induce actin cytoskeletal rearrangements and membrane ruffling. The concerted actions of these bacterial effector proteins eventually lead to the efficient uptake of the bacterium. SipA, SipC, SopB are multifunctional effectors also involved in effector translocation and in inducing host inflammatory responses. Despite improved understanding of these effectors and their individual roles in Salmonella-induced actin cytoskeleton rearrangements, little has been done to separate their multifunctional activities and to examine how these activities functionally interact to promote Salmonella invasion. In this study, we propose to investigate the individual contributions of their actin-modulating activities and how they are functionally coordinated during bacterial invasion. Our preliminary data showed that SipC exerts its actin-nucleation activity through transient dimer formation and that SipA and SipC may functionally cooperate to promote bacterial entry. We also demonstrated SopB-dependent VAMP8 recruitment to Salmonella-induced membrane ruffles and that VAMP8 is required for efficient bacterial invasion. We further determined that SipA and SipC may mediate SopB- and SopE-independent Salmonella entry. We hypothesize that SipA, SipC, SopB, and SopE function both cooperatively and independently to regulate host actin dynamics to promote Salmonella entry. To test this hypothesis, we will: (i) characterize the contributions of SipA, SipC actin-modulating activities in Salmonella invasion; (ii) define the molecular mechanism by which SopB promotes actin cytoskeleton rearrangements and Salmonella invasion; (iii) study how SipA, SipC, SopB, and SopE coordinate their actin-modulating activities to promote Salmonella invasion. Results from this study will provide a molecular basis for how SipA, SipC and SopB exploit the host actin cytoskeleton both independently and cooperatively to promote Salmonella entry.        Project Narrative: Despite the understanding gained by our long-standing interest in studying Salmonella, salmonellosis continues to pose worldwide medical concerns and remains the number one cause of food-borne diseases even in developed countries. The identification of host cellular targets of Salmonella virulence proteins will aid clinical therapeutic drug designs and treatment of multidrug-resistant bacteria.

1R21AI101403-01,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Botulism is caused by Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT), a CDC Category A biodefense threat agent for which no antidote exists. BoNT is the most potent toxin known and can be produced with relative ease. If large numbers of people were exposed to even a small dose of this toxin, they would become paralyzed and require assisted breathing which could easily overwhelm the limited supplies of respirators. We have developed small protein agents that, when expressed within intoxicated neurons, promote rapid degradation of BoNT proteases and improve rates of recovery from intoxication. We call these biomolecule agents targeted F-boxes (TFBs) because they consist of a 15 kDa F-box domain fused to a 14 kDa camelid VHH domain with binding specificity for a BoNT protease. Here we propose to develop adenovirus-based botulism antidotes that will specifically target motor neurons and lead to cytosolic expression of a TFB agent within intoxicated neurons. Adenoviruses (Ads) are ideal vehicles for delivery of TFBs to motor neurons for several reasons. First, Ad does not integrate their genome into infected cells and Ad vectors have been produced that are non-replicating and safe for therapeutic use. Second, Ad can be modified to dramatically reduce the normal tropism (liver) while increasing infection of a selected cell population. Thirdly, Ad vectors can be modified to produce a transient burst of transgene expression lasting only a few weeks after which the infected cells revert to normal. Finally, Ads have been found to infect motor neurons leading to transgene expression and, surprisingly, BoNT intoxicated motor neurons are much more efficiently infected than normal neurons. In the R21 phase of this proposed project, we will develop an adapter protein that will block normal Ad tropism while imparting tropism for motor neurons by employing a neuron-specific receptor binding domain (RBD) that derives from BoNT. Recombinant Ad will be engineered to express a TFB agent that targets the protease from BoNT serotype A (BoNT/A) for degradation and will be pre-treated with the neuron-targeting adapter. This modified Ad will then be tested as a botulism antidote by local injection into BoNT/A intoxicated muscles in mice. If successful, in the R33 phase we will make additional modifications to the Ad vector to further improve specificity for motor neurons and obviate the need for an adapter protein. We will also engineer an Ad antidote for another BoNT serotype, BoNT/B. These Ad vectors will be tested for the ability to accelerate recovery from botulism paralysis in mice following a systemic administration of the therapeutic agent. If successful, similar agents can be readily developed for all seven known BoNT serotypes by simply replacing the VHH domain of the TFBs with others having specificity for different BoNT proteases. In addition, the neuron-targeted Ad vehicles we develop may have applications in other important neuronal pathologies.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Botulinum neurotoxin is an extremely dangerous, CDC Category A biodefense threat that is widely available, easily produced, exceedingly toxic and for which no antidote is available. Furthermore, at least seven different toxin types exist, that would  each require distinct, challenging, expensive and prolonged antidote development programs using conventional approaches. In contrast, the innovative, virus-based strategy we propose to develop should quickly lead to safe, economical and commercially viable antidotes for all BoNT serotypes.",Motor Neuron-Targeted Adenovirus Antidotes For Botulism,2012,2014,"Curiel, David Terryshoemaker, Charles Bix ",Tufts University Boston,Boston,MA,26,1,-1,-1
2R01GM068851-09A1,National Institute of General Medical Sciences,93,"Vibrio cholerae is the causative agent of cholera, an acute life-threatening diarrhea disease. Cholera epidemics occur with seasonal regularity in endemic areas, such as the Ganges Delta region of South Asia. Cholera epidemics in 2010 in Africa, Pakistan, and Haiti remind us that further investigation of this disease is warranted. The ability of V. cholerae strains to cause severe enteric infection in humans depends on their virulence gene content. Bacterial viruses infecting Vibrio species (vibriophages/phages) are known to play a critical role in the transmission of the virulence genes among different strains of  V. cholerae (e.g., cholera toxin genes via the filamentous phage CTXf). Furthermore, our fieldwork in Bangladesh has provided direct evidence that lytic vibriophages seemly end cholera epidemics through predation and influencing infectivity. The objective of this proposal is to learn  how vibriophages drive the emergence of new pathogenic clones of V. cholerae through horizontal gene transfer, predation, and other biological interactions that affect properties such as biofilm formation, infectivity and environmental persistence. We will approach this problem with six specific aims 1) we will attempt to reconstruct the chromosomal arrangement of filamentous prophages found in the 7th pandemic strain, the most successful clone of toxigenic V. cholerae; 2) we will study the formation of hybrid filamentous phages encoding virulence properties and different host range; 3) we will use comparative genome sequence analysis of both phages and V. cholerae isolates to deduce the mechanisms of phage- resistance and displacement phages in Bangladesh aquatic environment; 4) we will utilize biofilm-degrading phages to study the effect of biofilm dissociation on V. cholerae infectivity and persistence in th environment; 5) we will test the ability of phages to mediate transfer of virulence genes or to produce virulence factors such as inflammatory molecules, cytotoxins and enterotoxins; 6) we will construct genetically marked phages suitable for environmental release and accurate subsequent molecular tracking in water and patients.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will test the hypothesis that viruses active on the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, play many undefined roles in the ecology of this pathogen including specialized forms of horizontal gene transfer, selection of emergent clones, production of virulence factors, and modulation of infectivity.

3U01AI075443-05S1,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) are classified by the Centers for Disease Control as one of the 6 highest-risk threat agents for bioterrorism (the Category A agents), due to their extreme potency and lethality, ease of production and transport, and need for prolonged intensive care. BoNTs have been produced and weaponized by rogue nations and deployed by terrorist groups. As a result of these threats, specific pharmaceutical agents are needed for prevention and treatment of intoxication. The only near term product for treatment of botulism that has been validated in animals and humans is antitoxin. Under previous NIAID funding, we have generated a potent human compatible recombinant monoclonal antibody based antitoxin for BoNT serotypes A, B, and E. The BoNT/A recombinant antitoxin is currently being developed under separate NIAID funding for human clinical trials. The overall goal of this proposal is to generate novel human compatible monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that can be used to prevent and treat botulism caused by BoNT serotypes C, D, F, and G. Achievement of this goal requires three components: 1) determination of the extent of BoNT gene diversity of these 4 toxin serotypes (C, D, F, and G); 2) generation of panels of broadly neutralizing human compatible mAbs to the four BoNT serotypes; and 3) in vitro and in vivo characterization of mAbs with respect to serotype cross reactivity and toxin neutralization. These goals will be achieved by an inter-institutional team of botulism experts who have worked in this field for more than 13 years: James D. Marks, antibody engineering and Leonard Smith, BoNT vaccine development, toxin and toxin fragment generation and animal models of toxin neutralization. They will be assisted by an expert in microbial genetic characterization, Karen Hill, at Los Alamos National Laboratory, who will define the extent of toxin diversity to ensure that antibodies neutralize all possible toxin subtypes. At the end of the funding period we anticipate having generated a recombinant antitoxin for BoNT serotypes C, D, F, and G that can be transferred into the manufacturing and late stage development pathway. Combined with previous results, this will make available a safe, efficacious human compatible antitoxin for all seven BoNT serotypes.","Development Of Botulinum Neurotoxin Immunotherapy, Serotypes C, D, F, And G",2012,2013,"Marks, James D.","University of California, San Francisco",San Francisco,CA,6,1,-1,5678

Despite the increasing awareness  of these agents as a major cause of diarrheal illness, assays for the diagnosis of human calicivirus infection are  not available to most clinical laboratories. There are also no effective antivirals available that can be used  therapeutically or prophylactically for this infection. This project will focus on high throughput approaches to develop rapid diagnostic assays for the detection of human caliciviruses and high throughput assays to identify potentially effective antiviral agents. We hypothesize that the reagents and strategies developed in the previous project period to target shared epitopes can be optimized and used to develop broadly reactive diagnostic assays for these antigenically diverse viruses. In Specific Aim 1, we will further optimize broadly-reactive reagents that can be used to make diagnostic assays for human caliciviruses. Studies in this aim will optimize single chain (scFv) antibodies with a range of binding specificities and monoclonal antibodies that recognize conserved epitopes, both of which were developed and characterized in the previous funding period. In Specific Aim 2, we will develop broadly-reactive diagnostic assays for human caliciviruses. Rapid formats that will be useable in the field to detect human caliciviruses will be identified. High affinity, cross-reactive single chain and monoclonal antibodies characterized in specific aim 1 will be used in assays that require minimal sample preparation and yield a result in less than 30 minutes. Formats to be evaluated are those that have been used successfully for the detection of other human viruses and include solid-phase immunoassays, and latex agglutination assays. In Speciflc Aim 3, we propose to develop high throughput assays to screen agents for antiviral activity against human noroviruses. A high throughput screen for inhibitors ofthe viral protease will be used to identify inhibitor candidates from small molecule libraries. The results obtained from project 1 studies will lead to the availability of new assays for the diagnosis of these important enteric pathogens and the identification of antiviral agents with the potential to diminish the disease burden caused these agents.",Rapid Diagnostics Assays And Antivirals For Noroviruses,,,"Atmar, Robert L.",Baylor College of Medicine,Houston,TX,51,1,47,1393

The long-term objectives of this laboratory are (I), To define the mechanism of how protein-protein interactions regulate CFTR Cl- channel function and (II), To dedicate our efforts toward making a long-term contribution in understanding gastrointestinal disorders related to diarrheal diseases. The specific aims of this proposal are: Specific Aim 1. To test the hypothesis that MRP4 is an apical cAMP transporter in the gut and inhibition of this transporter potentiates cholera toxin (CTX) induced diarrhea. Four subaims will be tested, they are (1a). To test whether MRP4 is an apical cAMP transporter in gut epithelial cells and to characterize the cyclic nucleotide transport using HPLC. (1b). To test whether MRP4 inhibition and MRP4 silencing (using Si-RNA) augments CFTR-dependent short circuit currents in the apical membrane of polarized gut epithelial cells and in excised mouse intestine. (1c). To test whether MRP4 inhibition can potentiate cholera toxin (CTX)-induced and CFTR-dependent secretory diarrhea in mice and to test if CFTR knock out mice fail to respond to CTX and MRP4 inhibition. (1d). To test whether MRP4 knock out mice are more susceptible to CTX-induced secretory diarrhea and to test if MRP5 inhibitors fail to induce secretion. Specific Aim 2. To test the hypothesis that there is a physical and functional coupling of cAMP transporter (MRP4) and CFTR Cl- channel at or near the apical plasma membrane of gut epithelial cells. Three subaims will be tested, they are (2a). To test whether the cAMP transporter (MRP4) is in a macromolecular complex with PDZK1 and CFTR and to define the stoichiometries of CFTR:PDZK1 and MRP4:PDZK1 complex in the plasma membrane of gut epithelial cells. (2b). To test if the disruption of the cAMP transporter containing macromolecular complex inhibits CFTR function and to test if the lateral mobility of CFTR and MRP4 increases (high diffusion rates) at the plasma membrane. (2c). To test whether cAMP accumulates at or near the plasma membrane (using a membrane associated cAMP sensor) upon inhibition of the cAMP transporter.  These studies will demonstrate that the two ABC transporters (CFTR and MRP4) can be functionally and physically coupled and that MRP4 inhibition can augment CFTR transporter function. The results of these studies will provide us with possible alternative methods and targets for treating certain diseases of the gastrointestinal tract such as secretory diarrhea and IBD.

4R37AI025096-27,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"The long range goal of the proposed work is to define the molecular components and mechanisms mediating Vibrio cholerae colonization and virulence protein secretion to the point where there is sufficient knowledge to intelligently incorporate this information into improved cholera vaccine strategies and antimicrobial therapies designed to inhibit these events. Most of the proposal involves analysis of the molecular mechanisms by which toxin coregulated pilus (TCP) is formed and mediates intestinal colonization. Some steps in the process by which TCP and other type 4 pili are built are linked and/or related to the process of toxin and other virulence determinant secretion by type II secretion systems. Thus further understanding of the mechanisms of type 4 pilus biogenesis should lead to the characterization of potential antimicrobial targets involved in multiple virulence pathways. We will examine the aspects of pilus biogenesis in detail. These experiments will be facilitated by our currently available collections of tcp genetic constructs and immunoreagents. Regarding the mechanism of TCP function, we will utilize the technique of field emission scanning electron microscopy in combination with specifially engineered tcpA missense mutations and a tcpB deletion mutant to address the biophysical mechanisms that lead to pilus supertwist formation, promoting the bacterial associations that represent the basis of microcolony formation in the intestine. Further characterization of TcpF and its role in colonization will be undertaken. This analysis is aided by the recent solution of the crytsal structure of TcpF and the mapping of a functional domain of the protein within this structure. Additional steps in the epithelial interaction with V. cholerae will be defined using carbohydrate binding analyses. Taken together, the results of the proposed studies will provide detailed information regarding the mechanisms of V. cholerae colonization from the levels of defining the components, understanding how they are elaborated to the cell surface and beyond. RELEVANCE (See Instructions): Diarrheal diseases caused by enteric infectious bacteria continue to cause significant morbidity and mortality world-wide, including within the US. Despite years of sophisticated research on V. cholerae, the causative agent of cholera, there is still no effective vaccine. The type 4 pilus, toxin coregulated pilus (TCP), of V. cholerae is the major colonization factor and represents a paradigm for type 4 pilus biogenesis and function throughout the realm of enteric bacteria.

5R37AI020148-30,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Escherichia coli O157:H7 is the most common infectious cause of bloody diarrhea, or hemorrhagic colitis (HC), in the U.S, and the incidence of non-O157:H7 Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) is about half that of O157:H7. Moreover, the hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a sequela of O157:H7 in particular but also other STEC infection, is the most frequent basis for acute kidney failure in U.S. children. E. coli O157:H7 belongs to a subset of STEC called Enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) that not only make Shiga toxin (Stx) type 1 or type 2 (or a variant thereof) but also harbor pO157 (or a related plasmid) and express the adhesin intimin, an outer membrane protein encoded by the eae gene contained within a pathogenicity island called the locus of enterocyte effacement. Intimin engages its bacterially-expressed translocated receptor Tir and also binds, albeit less avidly, to the eukaryotic receptor nucleolin. We recently found that Stx2 increased the level of nucleolin on the surface of HEp2 cells and, possibly as a consequence of such a toxin-mediated alteration of the cell surface of enterocytes, an Stx2-expressing EHEC O157 strain colonized the intestines of mice better than did its isogenic Stx2-negative mutant. The long-term goals of this project are to define at the molecular, cellular, and whole animal levels the pathogenic mechanisms by which STEC cause disease and to test strategies to prevent and treat these illnesses. The specific aims are to: 1. investigate whether both Stx1 and Stx2 contribute to the development of kidney lesions and/or other HUSrelated clinical features when produced from the same E. coli O157:H7 strain after oral inoculation of Dutch belted rabbits, a newly described model of HUS; 2. examine the basis for the enhanced virulence in orallyinfected, streptomycin-treated mice of STEC strains that produce the Stx2d-intestinal mucus activatable toxin (Stx2dact), an Stx2 variant that when produced by eae-negative STEC strains has been associated with bloody diarrhea and HUS in European patients; 3. continue to probe the role of Stx2 in the establishment of infection by E. coli O157:H7 in the murine gut, measure the impact of Stx2 on nucleolin expression in vivo, and test whether Stx1 can augment O157:H7 colonization; and, 4. determine whether Stx2 modulates nucleolin expression and/or distribution in epithelial cells and whether such changes are linked to Stx-induced apoptosis of intoxicated cells. Public health relevance: Due to the potential severity of O157:H7 infection and because the organism has a very low 50% infectious dose and can spread from person to person, E.coli O157:H7 is classified as a category B biological agent.

5F32AI096853-02,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Toxoplasma gondii is a widespread protozoan parasite that is capable of causing congenital disease in developing infants and severe complications in immunocompromised patients. Nearly a third of the human population is chronically infected by T. gondii. Current therapies are unable to cure chronic infection and intolerance, due to toxicity, often results from long-term treatment. Our ability to effectively treat T. gondii infection requires the identification of new therapeutic targets and the development of a rational drug design strategy. T. gondii is highly effective at parasitizing a broad range of warm-blooded hosts and can infect nearly any nucleated cell type. During the invasion process T. gondii injects a heterogeneous mixture of proteins from secretory organelles, known as rhoptries, into the host cytoplasm. The result is that many of the well known innate mechanisms employed by hosts to combat infectious parasites become unresponsive or inoperative. Host pathways involved in apoptosis, metabolite sequestering, and the immune response become effectively co-opted allowing T. gondii to complete its intracellular life cycle unimpeded. Proteomic analysis of the rhoptry organelles identified the presence of a highly expanded family of serine/threonine (S/T) kinases (ROP kinases) and genetic mapping studies of virulence genes implicated several of these as critical virulence factors. Approximately 20 active ROP kinases have been identified in the T. gondii genome and phylogenetic, structural, and functional analyses have indicated that they differ significantly from any of the major families of S/T kinases found in humans. Several polymorphic ROP kinases have since been shown to directly modulate parasite virulence yet, surprisingly, none were essential for parasite viability. The goal of this application is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the ROP kinase family by systematically determining their role in parasite viability and virulence. We will first define the essential members of the kinase family and characterize the phenotypic effects of protein knockdown on the intracellular life cycle in vitro as well as virulence in the mouse model. The role of the essential ROP kinases in host cell modulation will be assessed through microarray based comparison of transcriptional changes occurring after infection. The isolation of native core ROP kinase complexes and the trapping of host substrates will complete the analysis by providing insight into additional factors which may play a role in regulating kinase function or determining substrate specificity. In summary this project will integrate various phenotypic analyses, host cell transcriptional profiling, and proteomic characterization of ROP kinase complexes to yield a composite view of the role that essential ROP kinases play in critical host-pathogen interactions.

5R01AI043596-14,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"We propose a genetic study of the human-pathogen-environment relationship that underlies susceptibility to amebiasis. 8 years ago we started a prospective cohort study of Entamoeba histolytica infection in 300 two to five year old children living in the Mirpur urban slum of Dhaka, Bangladesh. We discovered that amebiasis is common and associated with malnutrition and geohelminth infection, that parasite genotypes differ in propensity to cause disease, and that mucosal IgA and systemic IFN-gamma are markers of protective immunity. Despite a substantial burden of disease, we noted that children differ markedly in their susceptibility to amebiasis. Our hypothesis is that susceptibility is determined by (a) host innate and acquired immune responses that vary between individuals in part due to human genetic polymorphisms; (b) environmental influences including malnutrition and concurrent geohelminth infection; and (c) virulence differences of E. histolytica genotypes. Three specific aims are proposed to delineate the interaction of host, parasite and environment leading to disease. Specific Aim (1) will measure the incidence of amebiasis and correlate it with human and parasite genetic polymorphisms, immune responses, and environmental factors such as geohelminth infection and malnutrition. As part of Aim 1 a 2nd cohort of 500 live births will be enrolled to separate innate from acquired immune responses, examine the burden of amebiasis in the first 2 years of life, and independently test genetic polymorphisms found to influence susceptibility in the older child cohort. Specific Aim (2) will test the hypothesis that protective immunity is mediated both by innate immune responses initiated via TLR stimulation as well as by mucosal IgA against the Gal/GalNAc lectin and systemic IFN-gamma. We will measure innate and acquired immune responses to E. histolytica in the 2 cohorts and correlate them with incidence of infection, host genetic polymorphisms and environmental factors. Specific Aim (3) will test for the association of common genetic polymorphisms in host innate and acquired immune genes with incidence of amebiasis. In the older child cohort, 2800 SNPs in 89 candidate genes will be typed and correlated with immune responses and susceptibility. Using a 2-stage study design (original cohort followed by birth cohort) candidate genes associated with susceptibility will be validated in the birth cohort. Successful completion of these studies will identify host, environmental and parasitic determinants of infection, while at the same time establishing the burden of infection by completion of the only prospective community-based study of amebiasis from infancy to age 18. Project Narrative     Amebiasis is a common cause of diarrhea and is associated with malnutrition in grade- school aged children in an urban slum of Dhaka, Bangladesh. We wish to determine the contribution of amebiasis to illness in the first 2 years of life when most deaths due to diarrhea occur, and understand the immunologic and genetic factors that protect children from amebiasis. Successful completion of these studies will provide an estimate of the impact of amebiasis on the health of the study children, and could lead to new approaches to prevent and treat this disease.",Field Studies Of Human Immunity To Amebiasis In Bangladesh,1998,2013,"Petri, William A",University of Virginia,Charlottesville,VA,55,1,1,1
1R21AI101172-01,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"The alarming increase in the incidence/severity of diseases caused by Staphylococcus aureus in recent years, particularly those caused by community-associated and hospital-acquired methicillin resistant strains, call for novel effective antibacterial strategies. The disturbing findings that such strains produce more virulence-determining toxins, including superantigens (SAg), mandate a multipronged attack using a combination of drugs that act at different stages of staphylococcal infection. While antibacterials  such as linezolid, which inhibit bacterial toxin production, are useful, bacteriostatics alone seem  to be not very effective. This is attributed to two major reasons. (i) Bacteriostatics fail to completely shut down toxin production in vivo. (ii) In the clinical settings, there is almost alway a significant time delay between the onset of S. aureus infection and initiation of antibacterial therapy. During this delay, significant quantities of pathogenic exotoxins have already been produced. Unfortunately, bacteriostatics have no activity on pre-formed exotoxins. Therefore, antibodies could be administered to neutralize toxins that were produced prior to initiation of therapy as well as to inactivate the residual toxins produced in spite of antibacterial therapy. Such antibodies would act synergistically with bacteriostatics. Since SAg are one of the most pathogenic exotoxins of S. aureus, in vivo neutralization of SAg may be the preferred approach. In addition, SAg have the unique ability to robustly and non-specifically stimulate the immune system followed by induction of unresponsiveness or anergy. SAg, thus divert the immune response against the bacterium, thereby helping in bacterial immune evasion. Therefore, stimulating the innate immune system will also be beneficial during S. aureus infections. Hence, we propose a combination therapy with the bacteriostatic drug, linezolid, neutralizing antibodies to superantigens, and immunomodulatory agents that boost innate immunity to effectively control/eliminate S. aureus infections. The effectiveness of this novel approach will be tested using the robust HLA class II transgenic mouse model. Lethal pneumonia will be induced in HLA-DR3 transgenic mice with a highly pathogenic strain of S. aureus that produces large amounts of the SAg, staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB). To mimic the clinical scenario, treatment will be delayed in 2-hour increments after initiation of infection. Mice will be left untreated or treated with various combinations of linezolid, human-mouse chimeric neutralizing anti-SEB antibodies or isotype control antibodies and the toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 agonist, Pam2CSK4. Protection from mortality will be studied. Thus, we would have established an effective combination therapy against lethal S. aureus infection and identified the therapeutic window of the combination therapy.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The incidence and severity of diseases caused by antibiotic resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus, producing highly pathogenic toxins are increasing drastically. Therefore, we propose to test the effectiveness of a new drug cocktail for the treatment of such S. aureus infections. Our cocktail would consist of an antibiotic, antibodies against a pathogenic staphylococcal toxin and a drug to stimulate immunity.",Novel Combination Therapy For Staphylococcus Aureus Pneumonia,2012,2014,"Rajagopalan, Govindarajan ",Mayo Clinic Rochester,Rochester,MN,28,1,-1,-1
5R01AI032074-20,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) strains are a leading cause of severe diarrhea worldwide. These strains use a type III secretion system (T3SS) to inject proteins into host cells, produce the attaching effacing effect, initiate the mitochondrial death pathway, and disrupt intestinal barrier function. Prior work has led to the discovery of the EspADB protein translocation apparatus and the EspF effector protein. With the overall goal of better understanding the mechanisms of EPEC pathogenesis, this proposal has four specific aims. (1) to determine the role of Abcf2 in EspF-induced apoptosis. The host Abcf2 protein is a target of EspF. Experiments will be conducted to test the hypothesis that Abcf2 is an anti-apoptotic protein that is degraded directly or indirectly by EspF. An abcf2 knockout mouse model will be used to study the effects of Abcf2 on apoptosis in tissue culture and in vivo. (2) to determine the role of EspF in alterations in barrier function. The evidence suggests that EspF is a bifunctional protein with separate effects on apoptosis that depend on mitochondrial targeting and on tight junctions that are independent of mitochondrial targeting. The role of Abcf2 in EspF mediated disruption of barrier function will be determined and alternative pathways that lead to this effect will be identified. (3) to define interactions among translocon components EspA, EspD and EspB. The prevailing model of the EPEC translocon proposes that the EspD and EspB proteins form a complex at the tip of the EspA filament that forms a pore in the host membrane through which effector molecules pass. Purified functional proteins will be used to test whether EspB and EspD form a complex and whether this complex is located at the tip of the EspA filament. (4) to determine the roles of EspB and EspD pore formation and in translocation of effector proteins through the pore. The abiity of purified proteins to form pores will be tested. The identification of a recessive espB allele that results in normal hemolytic activity but no effector translocation suggests a role for EspB in translocation that is separate from its role in pore formation. Whether this phenotype is due to a defect in connecting to the EspA filament or to a defect in assisting effector proteins to translocate the host membrane will be determined. The significance of this work is that it will lead to a better understanding of how bacteria inject proteins into host cells and interfere with pathways that protect the cells from death and maintain barrier function. E. coli strains are a leading cause of severe diarrhea worldwide. Some of these strains inject proteins into host cells, resulting in cell death and disrupting intestinal barrier function. By studying the specific proteins involved in these processes the work outlined in this proposal will lead to a better understanding of how bacteria inject proteins into host cells and interfere with pathways that protect the cells from death and maintain barrier function.",The Eae Gene Cluster Of Enteropathogenic E.

7R01AI046454-13,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"Enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) serotype O157:H7, an important agent of diarrheal disease, triggers the formation of filamentous actin pedestals on intestinal epithelial cells beneath sites of bacterial attachment. The ability to generate actin pedestals promotes late stage intestinal colonization and permits the formation of large aggregates on the epithelial surface. To generate pedestals, EHEC injects two effectors, Tir and EspFU, into mammalian cells via a type III secretion system. Tir is inserted into the host cell membrane and acts as a receptor for the bacterial outer membrane protein intimin. The C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of Tir is recognized by IRTKS (Insulin Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Substrate), a mammalian adaptor/effector that promotes the formation of F-actin and protrusive membrane structures at the plasma membrane. IRTKS also binds PI(4,5)P2 and deforms membranes, and binds the GTPase Rac, which is also known to stimulate actin assembly. Importantly, a C-terminal IRTKS SH3 domain binds to EspFU,, potentially linking it to Tir. EspFU contains multiple 47-residue proline-rich repeats and activates the actin nucleation promoting factor (NPF) N- WASP by mimicking and displacing an autoinhibitory N-WASP peptide. N-WASP is required for efficient translocation of Tir and EspFU, but if this block is overcome, EspFU can trigger an N-WASP-independent pathway for actin assembly, presumably by interacting with an alternative mammalian actin NPF. These findings suggest a model in which host actin assembly initially promotes translocation of Tir and EspFU, both of which bind IRTKS to assemble a complex at the plasma membrane, clustered by interaction with bacterial intimin, that potently stimulates two pathways of actin assembly. Tir/EspFU-mediated actin assembly may in turn promote more efficient type III translocation, and, by unknown means, epithelial colonization in vivo. IRTKS may play a role in pedestal formation in addition to linking Tir to EspFU, since pilot experiments suggest that the IRTKS binding sequence of EspFU enhances pedestal formation even when EspFU is directly fused to Tir. The following aims will be pursued to investigate both N-WASP- dependent and -independent mechanisms of actin pedestal formation, and to examine potential roles of pedestal formation during mammalian infection: (1) Determine whether Tir-, EspFU-, PI(4,5)P2-, and/or Rac-binding activity is important for IRTKS to promote actin pedestal formation; (2) Identify mutants of EspFU that are defective for the N-WASP-dependent and/or -independent pathways of pedestal formation; (3) Determine the relative importance of the N-WASP-dependent and N-WASP- independent pathways in pedestal formation on polarized intestinal epithelial cells, and (4) Investigate whether pedestal formation promotes stable bacterial attachment, disruption of tight junctions and/or translocation in vitro, and the clonal expansion of microcolonies on intestinal epithelium during infection.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O157:H7 is an important food-borne pathogen in North America, Europe and Japan (79) that causes both intestinal disease and a life-threatening systemic illness (51, 52) The interaction of intestinal bacteria with the gut wall is a critical step in disease (33), and EHEC triggers the host cell to generate striking pedestal-like structures beneath bound bacteria. These pedestal promote enhanced colonization of the gut later in infection, and these studies investigate EHEC induces pedestals and how this process promotes disease.",Actin Pedestal Formation By EHEC O157:H7,2000,2015,"Leong, John M",Tufts University Boston,Boston,MA,26,1,-1,1495
1R01AI103083-01,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,22,"The Picornaviridae are a large and diverse family of positive-strand RNA viruses that include a number of important human pathogens, among them hepatitis A virus (HAV), an hepatotropic virus that is the causative agent of acute hepatitis A and  the only species in the genus Hepatovirus. As a family, picornaviruses are non-enveloped. Their genomes are encapsidated within icosahedral capsids comprised of 60 copies of each of 3-4 polypeptides. High-resolution structural models have been developed for several pathogenic picornaviruses but not HAV, and its structure remains poorly defined. We have discovered that most HAV particles released by cultured human hepatoma (Huh-7.5) cells are fully enveloped in host-derived membranes. Remarkably, biophysical studies indicate that these enveloped hepatoviruses (eHAV) are also the dominant form of virus circulating in the blood during acute hepatitis A. eHAV particles are fully infectious, yet highly resistant to neutralizing anti-HAV antibodies. These novel observations provide a new view of hepatitis A pathogenesis, and raise important questions about the mechanism by which vaccines provide protection against hepatitis A even when administered 2 weeks after infection. Specific Aim 1 will use quantitative proteomics and immunoelectron microscopy to characterize viral and host-derived proteins present in eHAV particles, as these may provide clues to the origin of eHAV. Specific Aim 2 focuses directly on the biogenesis of eHAV, and will use reverse molecular genetics and RNAi knockdown of multiple host proteins to probe interactions of HAV with ESCRT complexes involved in endosomal sorting and proteins involved in autophagy. Both cellular processes are potentially relevant to eHAV release from cells. Specific Aim 3 addresses the fate of eHAV, focusing particularly on how anti-HAV antibodies neutralize eHAV after its entry into permissive cells, a process that is likely to account for the protection vaccines afford against disease when administered after infection with the virus. A subsidiary aim is to develop a murine model of hepatitis A in which these events can be studied and which can replace existing nonhuman primate models of HAV infection. Although a completely novel finding, membrane hijacking may not be unique to HAV. These studies are thus broadly relevant to other non-enveloped viruses and how vaccine-induced antibodies provide protection against disease.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is a common cause of acute viral hepatitis. It is a member of the Picornaviridae family, a diverse group of non-enveloped RNA viruses that includes many human pathogens. We have made the surprising discovery that HAV particles released by infected liver-derived cells in vitro, or circulating in the blood during acue hepatitis A, are packaged within a single-membrane envelope and, although fully infectious, are resistant to antibody-mediated neutralization. This membrane hijacking by HAV has broad implications for other non-enveloped viruses, and for the mechanism by which hepatitis A vaccines protect against disease even when administered 2 weeks after infection.",Membrane Hijacking: Biogenesis And Fate Of Enveloped Hepatovirus,2012,2017,"Lemon, Stanley M.",Univ of North Carolina Chapel Hill,Chapel Hill,NC,38,1,-1,1264
5R01MH079296-05,National Institute of Mental Health,94,"The behavioral manipulation hypothesis posits that parasites can change the behavior of hosts to increase the reproductive fitness of the parasite. The protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii fits this description well. Toxoplasma shuttles between an asexual life-cycle in rodents and a sexual life-cycle in cat intestine. In rodents, parasites preferentially localize to the brain. The parasite has evolved the capacity to, once having formed cysts in the brain, abolish the innate fear that rodents have of the odors of cats, and to convert that fear into an attraction; this increases the likelihood of the rodent being predated, thereby completing the parasite's life cycle. Our prior work has shown the robustness of this behavioral phenomenon, the preferential formation of Toxoplasma cysts in the amygdala, and the capacity of the parasite to reduce cell number and dendrite length in the basolateral amygdala. The present grant further explores the neurobiology of Toxoplasma's behavioral effects, in order to better understand both normal and pathological fear. Specific Aim 1 identifies brain regions that are candidates for mediating the behavioral effects of Toxoplasma. A time course study will indicate brain regions where Toxoplasma cysts form prior to the first emergence of the behavioral effects of the parasite. In addition, we will construct a map of brain regions activated in response to cat odor in control rats (using cFos expression as a marker), and then determine whether Toxoplasma blocks such activation in any of those regions. The candidate brain regions identified in this Specific Aim will be studied in the subsequent Aims. Specific Aim 2 studies whether Toxoplasma causes inflammation in local brain regions and whether that contributes to the behavioral syndrome. It will also investigate whether the parasite changes the number of cells (both neurons and glia) in different brain regions, and/or changes the complexity of dendritic processes in neurons. Finally, it will examine whether Toxoplasma blocks the effects of cat odor on extracellular concentrations of glutamate, GABA and dopamine in those candidate brain regions. Specific Aim 3 will explore the reductive bases of Toxoplasma's actions. The first part will be an analysis of protein expression profiles in brain regions implicated in the parasite's behavioral effects, and in the parasite as well. The second will be a conditioned medium experiment, determining whether the medium in which cultured Toxoplasma grows can have the same effects in the brain as the parasite itself. This will be a first step in determining whether a factor secreted by the parasite mediates the behavioral effects.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  Experiments proposed in this grant explore an unlikely intersection of parasitology and neurobiology, that is, loss of innate fear in rodents due to Toxoplasma infection. Pathological fear is central to several psychiatric disorders. Understanding how Toxoplasma abolishes fear will shed light on how fear is generated in the first place and how we can manage pathological fear.",Parasite / Host Interaction And The Neurobiology Of Fear,2008,2013,"Sapolsky, Robert M.",Stanford University,Stanford,CA,6,1,151,3892
