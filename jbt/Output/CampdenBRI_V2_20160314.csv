"123466"	"Vitamin D fortification of foods"	"2011"	"2014"	"Vitamin D is the term used to describe two molecules, ergocalciferol (vitamin D2, derived by UV irradiation of the ergosterol that is widely distributed in plants and other fungi) and cholecalciferol (vitamin D3, formed from the action of UV irradiation on the skin). Poor vitamin D status is a very common problem in the UK. This has important health consequences (such as muscle/bone function, increasing the risk of diabetes). This project is directly comparing the biological effects of vitamin D2 vs. vitamin D3 in fortified foods of different matrices (i.e. a solid vs. liquid food) using a dose of vitamin D that is realistic and relevant to the food industry (600IU/15µg per day). It will examine responses in Caucasians and South Asians, and explore 'systems' level (genetic/enzymatic) differences in potential responses to vitamin D fortification.

"124487"	"Novel processing of flour and starch"	"2011"	"2015"	"The functionality of wheat flour is determined by its physical properties and chemical composition. For example, swelling power and gelatinization temperature of wheat flour are highly dependent on the content and composition of components associated with starch such as proteins and lipids. Wheat flour is used as an ingredient in a multitude of food products such as breads, biscuits, cakes, batters, soups, sauces and coatings. While flour milling (the primary process) may be considered a mature technology, there has been less focus on developing secondary processing technologies to modify the functionality of flour (with the exception of heat treatment). Instead, processors tend to rely on the addition of ingredients and additives. The objective of this study is to gain a deeper understanding of the potential to modify flour functionality through modification of the base chemistry. The initial focus will be on selective modification of the lipid profile of flours. A second focus will be to modify the starch properties of flour. Studying these areas in more detail in a range of baked products will complement the already well developed understanding of the role of proteins in flour quality and functionality.

"126707"	"Protective effects of coffee and diabetes"	"2012"	"2016"	"There is significant epidemiological evidence to suggest that moderate coffee consumption is protective against the onset of Type II diabetes. However, intervention studies into the acute effects of coffee on glycaemic control are inconclusive. The aim of this study is to unambiguously establish evidence for the beneficial effects of moderate coffee consumption on postprandial glucose response. It will attempt to clarify whether the effect is attenuated by caffeine, and also shed light on the identity of the active component(s) in coffee. Ultimately, this could result in the identification of food-sourced ingredients which help to regulate blood glucose.

"128875"	"Ingredient functionality"	"2013"	"2015"	"Ingredient specifications for traditional bread products are well documented and understood. However, more than one third of all flour produced in the UK is used for non-bread applications. These include an increasingly wide range of products, including crackers, wafers, doughnuts, and batter coatings, for which the ingredient specifications are not fully understood. In addition, a wider range of bread-based products such as flat breads and tortillas are increasing in popularity. Methods for modifying raw ingredients to improve performance in processing and end product quality are of wide interest. Indeed, many companies have expressed an interest in a deeper understanding of the raw ingredient specifications for their products. An understanding of the functionality required of raw ingredients for various applications, and appropriate methods to test for them, will enable more accurate specification of raw ingredients for specific applications and better management of ingredient variability.

"128876"	"Improved fibre enriched baked goods"	"2013"	"2015"	"Consumption of wholegrain/fibre enriched bread and other baked goods remains low despite considerable evidence linking diets rich in fibre to reduced risks of obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. There is scope for developing new products to appeal to consumer interest in healthy products by using cereals other than wheat and introducing products other than bread. Of particular interest are oats, barley and pseudocereals (such as buckwheat). Soluble fibres (e.g. arabinoxylose, ß-glucan or inulin) provide an alternative to cellulose-rich wheat bran and introduce a different set of challenges for processing. These fibres are light in colour and may be more acceptable to consumers. Considerable academic research has been carried out into the use of pre-treatments to reduce the negative impact of fibre addition on bread quality. The feasibility of applying these techniques in plant bakeries will be evaluated in this work. "	"fred.gates@campdenbri.co.uk"	"Gates, Fred"	"44(0)1386 842093"	"437"	"-1"	"139"	"437"
"131992"	"Food authenticity - development of 'next generation' analytical technologies to protect the food industry from fraud"	"2014"	"2016"	"Following the recent issues with horse DNA found in meat products, there is increasing concern and interest in all parts of the industry regarding the authenticity and adulteration of foods and raw materials. This follows previous concerns regarding adulteration of milk with melamine and addition of illegal dyes to spices. The concern goes beyond the specific issue of the origin of meat and has been identified as one of the most important issues globally concerning food and drink. Recent events have highlighted the need for member companies to have a resource to help them tackle authenticity issues, and to help them identify suitable modern analytical approaches to verify claims made on packaging and to confirm the identity of raw materials. Non-targeted screening methods are being sought by the food industry since these are not generally available. This project will look at the potential for new and emerging analytical technologies to fill some of these gaps to provide rapid and cost-effective ways of ensuring the authenticity of foods and drinks and detecting adulteration.

"131993"	"Assuring the quality and safety of cereal-based food products and ingredients for the food industry"	"2014"	"2016"	"This project will develop and maintain the industry agreed analytical methods which underpin the quality and safety of cereal based ingredients used in a wide range of foodstuffs including baked goods (breads, cakes, pastries, biscuits, crisps, chips, and tortillas), doughnuts, semolina, bran, batter, food coatings, pasta, soups and others. A form of MSFR project has supported the activities of this Cereals and Cereal Applications Testing Working Group (CCAT) and its previous incarnations on a rolling basis for at least three previous projects. During this period, the work has evolved from wheat and flour methods to include baked goods. The focus has been on assuring quality and safety of ingredients in the cereal chain. The relationship with food companies across the supply chain has expanded and evolved as a result of previous projects and is continuing to address measurement issues important to the food industry.
