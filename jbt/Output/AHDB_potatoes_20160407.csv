"R461"	"Detection of Potato Storage Diseases Using Field Asymmetric Ion Mobility Spectrometry"	"http://potatoes.ahdb.org.uk//publications/r461-detection-potato-storage-diseases-using-faims"	"2012"	"2015"	"Industry Challenge Storage diseases of potatoes cause major losses each year for the industry. Diseased potatoes and in particular those associated with bacterial soft rots release specific volatile compounds which if recognised would allow early detection and diagnosis, enabling store managers to initiate preventative measures. Early detection of Pectobacterium carotovorum in store is therefore extremely desirable if the disease is to be controlled and contained. Collaboration University of Warwick, FERA, Owlstone Nanotech and Sutton Bridge Crop Storage Research (SBCSR)  Approach This approach will also be investigated for detection of important quarantine diseases of potato in contained import consignments. Other sensors such as the latest electronic noses will also be assessed. The project will be multidisciplinary involving novel approaches to instrument engineering, volatile identification, data analysis and plant pathology. Objectives: a) Collect pathogen isolates and develop/adapt methodologies for artificial inoculation of potato tubers focussing on P. carotovorum but also including selected fungal pathogens and the quarantine pathogens Ralstonia. solanacearum and Clavibacter michiganensis. b) Develop and optimise methodology for recording volatile fingerprints over time for healthy and diseased potato tubers in controlled laboratory conditions using FAIMS and compare with other sensor technologies such as electronic nose. c) Determine the effect of environmental conditions on volatile release and detection. d) Identify characteristic volatiles for each disease using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and develop a database of FAIMS fingerprints associated with these target molecules. e) Develop intelligent systems analysis, such as neural networks and genetic algorithms to optimise FAIMS / electronic nose to improve recognition of the target signals. f) Determine the efficacy of FAIMS / electronic nose to detect diseases in experimental potato stores. Further optimise volatile fingerprint detection. g) Determine the efficacy of FAIMS / electronic nose to detect diseases in commercial potato stores."

Industry Challenge Storage of potatoes for the fresh market is carried out at low temperatures, typically in the range 2 to 3.5°C. A storage temperature in this range is selected in order to maintain the appearance of crops, with conditions restricting the development of skin blemishing diseases, maintaining bloom and limiting weight loss. The maintenance of a low storage temperature however adds to the costs of storage and induces sweetening. As well as affecting flavour and texture, sugar formation in combination with amino acids, results in relatively high acrylamide levels when certain preparation methods are employed. Collaboration SBCSR Approach Objectives: a) To evaluate the effect of storage temperatures on the components of skin finish e.g. skin bloom and blemish disease (black dot, silver scurf, skin spot). b) To evaluate the effect of storage temperatures on other quality criteria known to be influenced by temperature e.g. respiration rate, sprouting, weight loss and sweetening. c) To determine the cost/benefit of temperature variation. d) To indicate what factors of skin finish limit storage temperature increase, which may require further research.   Reports"	"146"	"Briddon, Adrian"	"-1"	"-1"	"SBCSR"

The threshold inoculum loading on seed tubers required to induce disease in the field, and the contribution of seed storage conditions to disease risk in the subsequent crop, is understood for some pathogens but requires determination for other important pathogens. Objectives: a) Quantify the effect of varied storage management of seed potatoes on pathogen populations. b) Quantify the effects of varied storage management on the subsequent crop health. c) Establish a storage-field cycle baseline against which other or new threats, or changes to practice, can be compared experimentally. d) Compare varied storage management and subsequent crop performance with commercial practice. e) Determine effective integrated control strategies for maintaining good seed tuber health during storage.   Reports  "	"146"	"Harper, Glyn"	"-1"	"-1"	"SBCSR"

These are members of a large grouping of bacteria known as actinobacteria (sometimes also referred to as actinomycetes). The streptomycetes are probably some of the most well-known and well-studied actinobacteria, because they produce compounds that are used in human medicine. Streptomycetes are ubiquitous in soil, sediments and seawater and there is increasing evidence to show that they form associations with other organisms such as insects (Seipke et al., 2012). A limited number of species of Streptomyces cause disease in plants. Those that are plant pathogenic colonize root structures and grow both inter- and intra-cellularly within the host (Loria et al., 2003 ) and produce phytotoxins and secondary compounds that affect the plant. The phytotoxin thaxtomin A is considered to be essential for scab symptoms to appear. An assay for the thaxtomin pathogenicity gene (txtA) has been developed and used to assess the numbers of pathogenic streptomycetes present in tuber peel. This has allowed comparison of their numbers on different potato varieties grown under the same conditions and studies of how numbers of pathogenic streptomycetes change in response to factors such as irrigation.  AHDB Potatoes supported the production of a review of common scab in 2004 and was the sole or joint funder for three research projects.

Industry Challenge Sclerotinia disease caused by the fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is an increasing problem in the UK. It causes significant losses in arable and vegetable crops in the rotation, including oilseed rape, peas, spring beans, potatoes, lettuce and carrots.  If this trend continues, rotations will become more limited and it may ultimately become uneconomic to produce some susceptible crops in the UK. S. sclerotiorum has two lifecycle phases targeted by control measures: airborne spores and long-lived resting bodies (sclerotia). Current control relies on foliar fungicides which prevent infection by airborne spores, but there is scope to improve both targeting of fungicides and treatments to soil.

Industry Challenge Pesticides usage survey data shows that potato crops in the UK receive, on average, ten blight sprays at close to the full label recommended dose. Control of potato late blight is going to become more difficult in the UK in future because of the impact of climate change and evolution in the P. infestans population towards increased virulence, aggressiveness and fungicide insensitivity. Continuing to rely so heavily on repeated applications of fungicide for control will not be effective and greater use will need to be made of cultivar resistance in an integrated control strategy, which does not compromise control and offers economic benefits.

Aims and Approach Previous AHDB Potatoes-funded work, using samples submitted by blight scouts, had shown that British late blight populations had changed over time. This project was commissioned to study the characteristics of the current populations and assess whether the changes may have implications for disease incidence, severity and control. Lab tests examined a series of key characteristics of the late blight pathogen (P. infestans) including; aggressiveness, response to different temperature and humidity regimes, type of spore germination and their ability to infect and survive on potato tubers.  The survival of P. infestans sexual oospores was investigated in a long-term study that involved field burial and recovery of samples that were tested for their viability in several different bioassays. The competitive ability of different pathogen lineages was also examined in a field trial in which a late blight epidemic was initiated and carefully tracked. Key Findings and Recommendations The detailed conclusions are provided in the R423 final report (below). Practical recommendations include:  Smith criteria remain a useful indication of risk of pathogen infection and disease spread on a regional basis. However, this study has shown that the criteria should be revised and that growers should be aware of the local environmental conditions are very important factors in considering disease risk and that infection can occur in a crop in the absence of a reported Smith period. There is no evidence from the tuber blight studies that the current pattern of use of zoospore-active and sporangia-active fungicides needs to be modified to accommodate the population change. Oospore inoculum is important in some regions of Europe but, within the GB industry, the risks remain low.  This is, in part, due to the nature of the P. infestans population and, in part, due to long rotations.  Growers should remain aware of the threat and keep rotations as long as possible to allow oospore inoculum to degrade. Modelling approaches to predicting of early infections and risks of disease spread have great potential to improve decision support and AHDB Potatoes is funding further work in this area (PhD studentship 115R471). Monitoring of GB late blight populations using samples submitted by blight scouts is ongoing and a summary of the 2014 and 2015 seasons' Fight Against Blight (FAB) data are provided below.

Industry Challenge There had been several projects in GB prior to 2010, mostly funded by AHDB Potatoes, examining the use of DNA-based tests to study potato blemish diseases. The results from a couple of the projects contributed to the development of a black dot risk assessment guide. Attempts to develop a risk assessment for black scurf and stem canker, incorporating the results DNA-based tests for Rhizoctonia solani, had proved to be more difficult Collaboration During 2010- 2012 AHDB Potatoes-funded researchers participated in an international collaboration to improve the reliability and interpretation of results from DNA-based diagnostic tests. The programme of work involved researchers in GB, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand. The collaboration allowed a greater range of experiments to be completed whilst ensuring that there was no duplication of effort on diagnostics development. The main focus of the work was soil and seed borne diseases including powdery scab, Rhizoctonia and common scab, although black dot and root knot nematode (Meloidogyne fallax) diagnostics have also been studied. The Australian component of the diagnostics work continued until winter 2014. Risk assessments based on DNA-based soil test results have been validated on commercial crops in South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania.  The tests are being offered as a commercial service (PreDicta Pt) in Australia and provide an indication of the risk of powdery scab, black dot and root knot nematode (M. fallax). DNA levels of Streptomyces txtA gene (associated with the development of common scab), R. solani AG3, R. solani AG2.1, Meloidogyne hapla and Verticillium dahliae are reported. However, these results are provided for information only as sensitivity and risk categories are not available for these tests. DNA-based tests for some of the pathogens (eg black dot, powdery scab) are also offered by research providers such as Fera and SRUC in GB. These were developed using results from a range of trials carried out in GB. It has not proven possible to develop risk assessments for R. solani based on soil test results, primarily because the research work in GB identified cases where soil samples tested negative for R. solani but disease caused by the pathogen subsequently developed in the crop. These anomalies are attributed to the distribution of R. solani in soil, which may mean that soil sampling protocols suitable for other soil borne pathogens do not apply to R. solani. Reports and other information Once the final report on the Australian work has been published it will be available on request via AHDB Potatoes. The final report of the British component of the project and a review of information on R. solani are available below.

"R421"	"Spongospora subterranea Genetic Diversity"	"http://potatoes.ahdb.org.uk//publications/r421-spongospora-subterranea-genetic-diversity"	""	""	"Global genetic characterisation of the powdery scab pathogen Introduction Powdery scab is one of the most serious diseases of potatoes wherever intensive potato cropping is carried out. It is caused by the pathogen Spongospora subterranea - which may be seed-borne or soil-borne. Consequently planting disease-free and uncontaminated seed-tubers in infested soil; or infected or contaminated tubers in uninfested soil can both lead to the development of disease symptoms.  Transporting diseased potatoes or contaminated soil has probably been the main route of spread of S. subterranea.  Given this, the extent of the genetic diversity of S. subterranea in different locations is difficult to predict. However, knowing about its diversity could be useful, for example when plant breeders are looking for sources of resistance to pathogens it is useful to know how genetically variable the pathogens are, as it may impact on the durability of resistance. AHDB Potatoes was one of several international sponsors who provided support for a PhD student to carry out research on the genetic diversity of S. subterranea. Results from her work are summarised below. Global study This study is the first to characterise the powdery scab pathogen on a global scale. Collections of the pathogen were obtained from 19 countries, from all continents (Figure 1). Close to 700 samples (from tuber lesions or root galls) were analysed using molecular techniques. Collections from South America were variable (six strains were differentiated), while collections from almost all other areas of the world were genetically identical to each other. This indicates that the pathogen probably originated in the highlands of northern South America (where greatest diversity occurs), the same area where potatoes were first developed as food crops. Figure 1. World map showing sources of collections of the powdery scab pathogen. Computer analysis procedures were used to test different scenarios of pathogen evolution and spread around the world. The pathogen was probably transported out of South America during the 1500s, when the conquistadors introduced potatoes to Europe. Only a very few original introductions from South America to Europe were likely, which accounts for the very low diversity in all countries other than in South America. Further spread probably occurred when European colonialists took potatoes from Europe to other areas. More recently, the export of seed potatoes from Europe has probably caused further dissemination of the pathogen. Implications for potato breeding The low diversity of the pathogen in all areas except South America has important implications. Potato breeders working to develop powdery scab resistant cultivars who are working in areas outside South America can proceed with the knowledge that the pathogen they are selecting against is genetically very uniform. This suggests that cultivars selected for resistance to powdery scab in one area are likely to be resistant in most other areas of the world. South America is likely to be a good area to find potato varieties that are resistant to powdery scab. Plant types from that area are likely to have been exposed to different strains of the pathogen and may possess usefully broad resistant characteristics. Another important outcome is that spread of different strains from South America to other countries should be prevented. This emphasises that plant quarantine regulations should be robust particularly to prevent import of potentially infested soil or plant material from South America. October 2013 Dr Rebecca Gau worked in Switzerland at the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule (ETH) in Zurich, and in New Zealand at the NZ Institute for Plant & Food Research at Lincoln. Dr Gau examined genetic variation in the powdery scab pathogen, and how the pathogen has dispersed around the world. Dr Gaus project was supervised by Dr Ueli Merz, Dr Patrick Brunner and Prof Richard Falloon, and was funded by the ETH; Horticulture Australia Ltd; AHDB Potatoes; the New Zealand Ministry for Science and Innovation; Potatoes New Zealand (Horticulture New Zealand); and the Swiss Ministry for Agriculture.

Industry Challenge The genome sequence could provide the information to improve the dietary and commercial qualities of the potato, through the identification of genes controlling quality, appearance, nutritional value etc. Commercial growers can be applying up to 20 fungicide sprays per season to control disease, and the UK potato crop currently consumes half of the total irrigation water used. Through identification of candidate genes for biotic and abiotic stress resistance the potato genome sequence has the potential to provide solutions to these issues and may help to minimise the environmental impact and mitigate the effects of climate change. Collaboration James Hutton Institute (JHI) formerly SCRI, University of Dundee Approach The Potato Genome Sequencing Consortium (PGSC) is an international collaboration and aims to determine the sequencing of the 'gene-rich' regions of the potato genome by the end of 2010. The UK will only be sequencing chromosome IV. The potato genome is very similar to tomato (also a member of the Solanaceae) and as the UK is also sequencing tomato chromosome IV, this will enable highly detailed comparative sequence analysis of these two crop species. Moreover, by studying gene and genome sequence data a 'genetic marker' system can be created based on small DNA variations between different varieties. This will allow the examination of a large number of genes and the variation between varieties with different characteristics.

The availability, efficacy and desirability of pesticides for the control of weeds, pests and disease in GB potatoes is under pressure. The project was carried out in parallel with a similar study commissioned by HGCA and the approaches taken were compatible with those of the HGCA investigation so as to provide information on national consequences of the loss of availability of active ingredients. The information has been displayed in a matrix format that can be updated according to changes in the availability of active ingredients."	"146"	"Clarke, James"	"-1"	"-1"	"ADAS"
"R291"	"Testing potato varieties for susceptibility to PMTV"	"http://potatoes.ahdb.org.uk//publications/r291-pmtv-screening"	"2007"	"2008"	"Aim: To determine if field trials, using PMTV-free tubers planted into naturally infested field soils, can be used to provide reliable information on variety susceptibility to PMTV. At present, only limited and anecdotal evidence exists on the relative susceptibility of potato cultivars to potato mop top virus (PMTV) and to symptom expression on plants and tubers.  Therefore work is needed to establish the relative susceptibility of the most popular cultivars, particularly the extent to which infection may occur without symptom development (symptomless infection). However, the complex epidemiology of PMTV makes it more difficult to assess cultivar susceptibility employing the type of pot-tests generally used for disease testing.  Ten GB grown cultivars were planted at two sites, in each of two years and a programme of testing samples of soil and tubers pre-planting and post-harvest was carried out. The recommendations from the work include: 1. Testing potato varieties for susceptibility to PMTV should concentrate on assessing susceptibility to transmission and spraing over one season by exposing test material to infection from inoculum in the growing medium. The development of foliar symptoms is significantly influenced by environmental conditions and is a poor indicator of PMTV infection and, thus, not a suitable tool for assessing varietal resistance. 2.  If a field test is used for varietal testing, the plot area should be tested for PMTV before planting to ensure that inoculum is uniformly distributed across the intended area.  However, the current test using tomato as bait plant followed by detection of PMTV in roots by real time PCR cannot give an accurate assessment of the amount of infestation in the soil because the bait plant acts as an enrichment step distorting the amount of inoculum originally in the sample. A pot test, using amended compost, could be considered as an alternative to conducting field tests but further work is required to establish the reproducibility of the test. 3. Tests should be conducted for more than one year because differences amongst varieties in susceptibility to PMTV infection, as with the ten tested here, may be relatively small and differences in respect to spraing appeared to be variable amongst years and trials. The reasons for this variability in spraing reaction are unclear and factors affecting spraing development may merit further investigation, both for testing and grower management purposes. 4.  Planting PMTV-infected seed in clean land gave variable results in terms of infesting the soil and the risks involved for growers merit further study.  Reports and Key Words"	"146"	"Carnegie, Stuart"	"-1"	"-1"	"SASA"

Black scurf is a blemish disease of potato caused by the fungus Rhizoctonia solani and is characterised by black sclerotia on the tuber surface. With increasing emphasis on skin quality in the pre-pack and seed potato markets, this disease has increased in significance and is considered one of the three major tuber disease problems of the potato industry. In addition to producing a blemish on the tuber, the fungus can infect developing sprouts and stolons from the seed tuber prior to emergence resulting in the formation of cankers. This infection can result in delayed emergence, an uneven and reduced tuber set and an undesirable tuber size distribution. The source of the fungal inoculum can be either the seed tuber or soil. The presence of black scurf or mycelial threads of the fungus on seed tubers can be established visually and microscopically and this permits a rational decision on the use of a Rhizoctonia-specific fungicide treatment. Where used, fungicide seed treatments have proved very effective at controlling seed-borne inoculum. However, soil-borne inoculum is not controlled by a seed tuber fungicide treatment. Published studies on soil-borne inoculum have indicated that the fungus is not long-lived in soils and that during a long rotation the level of soil infestation declines markedly. Other studies have suggested that the impact of the disease is greatest in lighter soils. However, observations over the last decade suggest that these findings no longer hold true. Whilst light soils probably do represent the greatest risk, quality problems from black scurf development on tubers are common on a wide range of the best land for potatoes and an increase in prevalence of potato groundkeepers, which sustain a high level of soil-borne inoculum. At the time this project was carried out, growers had no way to predict which fields harbour the greatest amount of the fungus. Three different methods were tested for their ability to detect the fungus in soil. Further work on DNA-based methods for detecting Rhizoctonia were carried out on project R253. Reports"	"146"	"Wale, Stuart"	"-1"	"-1"	"SAC"

Existing methods of predicting the occurrence of TRV rely either on counts of trichodorid nematodes, which do not necessarily correlate with the presence of the virus, as the nematodes may not be viruliferous, or on various bait test systems. A sensitive PCR-based method was used to map the occurrence of virus in the roots of weeds in fields prior to potato cropping (2004). Spraing susceptible potatoes were then used to assess the predictive ability of the test (2005).  TRV was successfully identified in weeds at the sites studied. Risk areas, where high levels of virus were detected in 2004, were correlated with high levels of spraing in 2005. However, in areas with low levels of virus infection there was a weaker relationship between the test results and the levels of spraing that developed in 2005. It was concluded that the assay offered benefits compared to some existing methods, but that in areas with low level virus infection environmental factors, that influence nematode feeding/virus transmission, may have a disproportionate influence on the occurrence of spraing.

European populations of the late-blight pathogen, Phytophthora infestans, include both mating types (A1, A2). In the mid 1990s, GB-wide surveys showed that most crops had a single clonal lineage of A1 mating type; the A2 mating type was detected at less than 10% of sites.  Samples of blighted foliage were collected by Blight Scout volunteers as part of the Fight Against Blight (FAB) campaign and sent to CSL for confirmation of the presence of P. infestans. Positive samples were forwarded to the Sarvari Research Trust (SRT) for further analysis. In 2005, the pathogenicity of previously collected isolates was compared under field conditions. The work has indicated a change in the frequency of the A2 mating type in England, however as the results were based on a limited number of samples, further research has been carrried out in project R274. Two reports are available for downloading. The second describes the frequency of A1 and A2 mating type in FAB samples and the results from the studies of the pathogenicity of different isolates and the characterisation of the A2 isolates.
