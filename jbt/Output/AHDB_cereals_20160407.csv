There is now an opportunity to provide an early indication of regional fusarium risks within the season that can be used by farmers during the completion of their risk assessments to improve accuracy, and by the supply chain, to get a better understanding of regional in-season risks. The project The overall aim is to improve the information available on fusarium infection risk during flowering to raise awareness amongst farmers of mycotoxin risks, to aid accurate completion of mycotoxin risk assessments and increase reliability of information, and to give an early indication of season regional mycotoxin risks for the supply industry. This would be achieved through: 1. Monitoring and reporting – Run weekly fusarium infection risk monitoring from ear emergence (mid-May) to end of flowering (early July) covering 30 counties in GB and provide six reports on fusarium infection risk in each year. 2. Validation – Undertake targeted harvest mycotoxin DON test results to compare to monitoring. 3. Develop methodology and pilot use of early season mycotoxin testing (between flowering and harvest). The benefits The project would provide more accurate level of information around the fusarium infection risk at flowering. Weekly reporting will aim to raise farmer’s awareness of the local fusarium infection risk, and subsequent concerns of mycotoxin. This would allow farmers will take action to minimise the mycotoxin risks in their grain, e.g. through timely ear wash applications, or through segregation and appropriate marketing of high risk crops. The early indication of fusarium infection risk should provide the industry with an early warning of mycotoxin hot spots that may need greater focus on testing if grain is purchased from those regions.

Control is difficult, however, as the fungus produces numerous microsclerotia in affected stems as the crop matures. The microsclerotia become incorporated in soil, creating a long term inoculum source, and the fungus may also contaminate seed externally. There are currently no available agrochemical control options, and extending oilseed rape rotations to reduce the impact of the disease is a long term strategy. Variation in the level of symptom expression in oilseed rape varieties has been reported from several trials, indicating that partial resistance to the disease exists in elite material. The project This project aims to develop an inoculated test protocol, coupled with variety screens on heavily and uniformly infected land, to test for consistent differences between Recommended Lists (RL) varieties with the aim of producing 1 to 9 verticillium wilt resistance ratings for the RL. This proposal will also investigate the relative effects of verticillium wilt on the yield of putative partially resistant and more susceptible varieties, by means of high and low disease pressure blocks created by soil inoculation. Outcomes will aid growers in the practical interpretation of resistance ratings and define more precisely the effects of verticillium wilt on oilseed rape productivity over sites and seasons. The benefits Independent data on varietal tolerance to verticillium wilt will be provided as well as robust information on the level of yield loss which might be expected on infested land. Growers will be able to select varieties according to their verticillium risk using 1 to 9 rantings. If land is known to be infected, more resistant types could be selected to avoid potential yield losses. View a printer friendly version of this publication"	"146"	"Thomas, Jane"	"-1"	"-1"	"NIAB"

Farmers protect key leaves with fungicides but sporadic diseases (e.g. Sclerotinia and Fusarium) infect at other growth stages. This leaves crops susceptible to disease or can lead to fungicides being applied unnecessarily. A third disease, septoria leaf blotch ( Zymoseptoria tritici or Mycosphaerella graminicola ), also has a sporadic late phase of infection caused by airborne ascospores which can infect the flag leaf of wheat when an earlier fungicide spray has degraded. A reliable forecast is needed to alert farmers of imminent risk of these diseases in time for action. Current conventional air samplers can detect the presence of specific spores in the air; however, these samplers require tedious and time-consuming lab-based processing which delays the communication of disease risk. The project The project aims to produce an automated air sampling device, which will be able to use a DNA-based method to rapidly detect key pathogens, or genetic traits such as fungicide resistance, and text the result, along with weather data to a web-based information portal, which will be accessible to growers. The devices have the potential to be operated as a network with IT systems augmenting currently available infection models with the information on airborne spore presence to produce a disease risk alert in time for application of crop protection products. Two automated air samplers will be developed during the project which will operate in a network of conventional air-samplers. Methods will be developed to rapidly detect and quantify sclerotinia, fusarium and M. graminicola spores both by the automated air sampler and on tapes collected from the conventional samplers. In-season results and disease alerts will be made available on cereals.ahdb.org.uk/monitoring . Air samplers will be placed on field sites located in Hertfordshire, Lincolnshire, Devon, Herefordshire and North Yorkshire.   The benefits The methodologies and technology developed through this project have huge potential to improve the use of spore detection in crop protection. Real-time information on the presence or absence of spores in the air will allow fungicide applications to be better targeted, which will both reduce yield losses caused by disease and also reduce unnecessary spray applications. Spore release information will enhance and improve the robustness of existing weather based disease forecast models. There is further potential for this technology e.g. through the inclusion of appropriate test reagents to assess these genetic traits such as fungicide resistance.

There are significant declines in sensitivity to the former group and the latter group is classed as being at moderate or high risk of resistance occurring. In addition, recent years have seen reduced control of septoria on farm despite large spend on fungicides. Alternative, integrated management methods are required to improve control and slow development of resistance. The project This project will directly compare the value of cultural control measures as part of a disease management programme, specifically sowing date and disease-resistant varieties. It will evaluate their ability to reduce the intensity of fungicide required, whilst minimising yield losses to septoria and maximising profit. This will be quantified in terms of yield, disease control and margin over fungicide cost to provide information on how current strategies could be altered and the resulting effect on crop profitability. In the event of further resistance development to current fungicides or the loss of actives through legislation, this research will inform stewardship and mitigation options using cultural options along with remaining chemistry, to minimise the impact on crop production and profitability. Where growers already employ cultural control methods (for example where they are sowing later or using less susceptible varieties), this research will provide clear guidance on scope to adjust fungicide strategies. The benefits This will benefit growers and agronomists by: 1. Identifying and quantifying the impact of key agronomic factors that can reduce the risk of yield loss to septoria 2. Improved prioritisation of fungicide strategies in the spring, based on risk 3. Optimising the order of planting varieties to reduce disease risk where varieties with a range of different susceptibilities are planned (accounting for other agronomic factors such as developmental speed and lodging risk). Growers will benefit by being able to maximise the benefits that accrue from agronomic modifiers of septoria risk, enabling them to make strategic decisions on which crops will benefit from intensive or reduced fungicide inputs. This will minimise yield losses to septoria in a way that maximises the cost effectiveness of fungicide programmes. In addition, growers will benefit from having robust information on the extent to which cultural control strategies can ameliorate the impact of future loss of fungicides, resulting from either further development of resistance or legislative impacts.

Over recent years, a series of yellow rust races, including the Warrior race, have arisen in Europe and overcome some of the major resistance genes in elite germplasm. Despite the success of the United Kingdom Cereal Pathogen Virulence Survey (UKCPVS) and our understanding of the phenotypic diversity of yellow rust, little is known about its genetic diversity. To address this, a novel approach called “field pathogenomics” for pathogen population surveillance has recently been developed by The Genome Analysis Centre. This method, based on new gene sequencing technology, allows data to be acquired directly from field samples of yellow rust-infected wheat. By implementing this approach it has been found that the yellow rust population across the UK underwent a major shift in recent years. The project The overall aim of this project is to apply gene-sequencing technology to the surveillance of yellow rust and undertake comprehensive global population genetic analyses of this important plant pathogen. Specific objectives: 1. Analyse the threat of potential exotic incursions of PST to the UK by mapping the global population structure. 2. Define associations between PST genotypes, pathotypes and host pedigrees (working with UKCPVS) 3. Characterise temporal and spatial dynamics of PST genotypes 4. Develop open-source tools to map PST population structure and relay this information to the wider community Within this large project, AHDB funds will be specifically used for the development of the genotyping platform. This platform will then be integrated into the United Kingdom Cereal Pathogen Virulence Survey (UKCPVS) at the completion of the project. The benefits Once established, the genotyping platform will provide UKCPVS with a cost-effective way to genotype isolates. In the long-term this will ensure the UKCPVS is more predictive and better fulfils its main objective of gaining an early indication of new races and predicting durability of wheat varieties. This will also place the UK at the forefront of the most progressive pathogen surveillance mechanisms. Farmers, breeders, agronomists and wheat variety testing authorities will benefit from the rapid means of confirming whether previously resistant wheat varieties have been broken by virulent races of the pathogen.

The pathogen responsible (Plasmodiophora brassicae) can persist in soils for up to 20 years, so cannot be managed practically through extending normal arable rotations. Varietal resistance remains the most effective method of clubroot control but the resistance source is not effective against all pathotypes of the disease and ‘resistance breaking strains’ have become more prevalent. Soil treatments with lime, calcium or boron give partial control, but strategies such as raising field pH to over 7.5 are not practical over whole fields in the context of arable rotations, as other crops within the rotation might be severely compromised. Targeted treatment of affected patches offers a potential approach and will be more cost effective than treating whole fields. The project The project aims to develop cost-effective treatment of clubroot through an understanding of the prevalence of resistance breaking strains of P. brassicae present in the UK and by targeting the use of resistant varieties and soil treatments to regions and field patches where they are needed and likely to be effective. A second aim is to increase the impact of the research and add value through knowledge exchange with stakeholders and scientists by holding regular stakeholder events. The benefits This project will develop more practical and economical methods of managing clubroot through an understanding of the prevalence of ‘resistance breaking strains’ present in the UK and through field mapping to establish the impact and spread of the disease in oilseed rape in order that available control strategies can be targeted to affected patches. This approach will improve production efficiency for the grower and extend the useful lifespan of available control strategies, as well providing breeders and researchers with UK relevant information on clubroot status and variability to improve and better target control of this disease.

Variable rate application of PPP to cereal crops is technically feasible with currently-available commercial equipment. However, the agronomic rationale for variable doses for PPPs is not currently clear. The project This project aims to explore some of the fundamental mechanisms involved in determining the dose received by the plant, and how this is influenced by crop structure, and the extent to which this affects dose responses to PPPs. The main objective will be to identify if there are situations where adjusting the dose to achieve a constant dose per unit plant mass or surface area can optimise the use of PPPs, particularly fungicides or plant growth regulators. If this is the case, a cost-benefit analysis of different scenarios will be undertaken to enable future developments to focus on where the benefits will be greatest. The project will attempt to prove a central hypothesis, that to achieve optimum performance, doses of PPPs should be applied per gram of plant material for systemic, or per unit surface area for contactacting products. This will be done through four key work packages. 1. To review the state of the art in dose adjustment and optimisation for cereal crops, identify the situations (crop, pest, disease, product) where the hypothesis is most likely to be true and develop a model system (crop , PPP and application method) for use in the project.  2. To develop a model relating applied dose to actual dose for the model crop(s), for a ‘standard’ application method, using existing sensors and/or manual methods to characterise the crop. 3. To identify the circumstances for which the project hypothesis it is true, and develop algorithms for optimising dose for different crop characteristics for the model system. 4. Undertake a theoretical cost-benefit analysis for the model system. The benefits The outcomes of the project will be valuable in optimising applications of plant protection products, contributing to reducing the environmental impact and allowing products to remain available at a time when many active ingredients are at risk from failing the approval process. The project outcomes will also assist in identifying where growers can expect to see benefits from variable rate application technology in the future, and can support future investment decisions, leading to new developments in precision agriculture and sprayer control. It will also improve our understanding of the mechanisms that are important in delivering a dose of PPP to a plant and how they could be manipulated to optimise the application process. This could be of value to agrochemical manufacturers who wish to optimise the application of their products.

Good control with fungicides is now difficult to achieve and greater use of cultivars with good resistance against the causal pathogen is essential to manage the disease. There is new evidence about resistance against light leaf spot in oilseed rape; a major resistance gene has been mapped to the bottom end of chromosome A1 in B. napus. Other sources of resistance have not been characterised genetically but rapid progress in mapping resistance genes against P. brassicae is expected as genome sequences of brassicas are now available. This information can be exploited to provide guidance for breeding cultivars with improved resistance. The project This project aims to exploit new information about resistance and genome sequences to improve control of light leaf spot in brassicas. Specific project objectives include: 1. To sequence a resistance gene against P. brassicae at the end of oilseed rape chromosome A1. 2. To use the sequence of the resistance gene to identify other resistance genes in commercial oilseed rape cultivars with good resistance against P. brassicae. 3. To use available segregating populations to map resistance genes and generate markers for marker assisted selection in oilseed rape breeding programmes. The benefits This project will provide new information to improve brassica resistance against the light leaf spot pathogen to increase yields of oilseed rape, whilst decreasing production costs through reduced fungicide use.

It is important to obtain consistently effective control; otherwise even low level disease contributes to the build-up of long-lived inoculum in the soil. Airborne spores result in plant infection when flowering has started and weather conditions are conducive. Foliar fungicide treatments must be applied to prevent infection, before disease symptoms are visible. However, the timing of foliar fungicide applications to prevent infection can be difficult because the period when the crop is at risk of infection is longer than the period of fungicide protection. Results from a recent research project (LK09130, HGCA 3570) showed that a simple weather-based infection model, using temperature and relative humidity forecasts up to 48 hours ahead, could help to plan and target spray applications. Inclusion of other sclerotinia infection risk factors was also helpful, for example, crop flowering stage, rainfall intensity and spore inoculum estimates. This reflects the complex infection process for S. sclerotiorum in oilseed rape which requires simultaneous occurrence of inoculum, suitable weather conditions and flowering stage. Work is needed to bring together the risk factors and forecasting in a simple format for growers and agronomists to use. The project The overall aim of this project is to provide a sclerotinia disease risk reporting system, to help guide fungicide timing, improve control of sclerotinia, and therefore reduce crop losses. This will be achieved by providing forecast alerts and reports of risk factors for sclerotinia infection to growers during the oilseed rape flowering phase. This is to guide the timing of the first fungicide application needed during flowering, and when or if a subsequent application is necessary. This will be done as a ‘live’ reporting system by generating weekly reports which will deliver both forecasting model predictions and information on other disease risk factors based on crop observations (e.g. are there petals sticking to leaves?) and quantification of airborne inoculum, as well as an overall assessment of sclerotinia disease risk. This is different from previous schemes which have only evaluated specific models or risk factors in isolation. The reports will present the data in appropriate simple tables and charts, and interpretation of the in-field and regional results will be provided. Reports will be published on cereals.ahdb.org.uk/monitoring . Work will also be done to demonstrate that the forecasting and risk evaluation scheme provides improved control of sclerotinia and gives an economic benefit. The benefits The main benefit of the project will be to inform the timing of fungicide applications to give maximum protection against sclerotinia infection. This will result in a reduction of yield losses caused by the disease. In some cases, the impact will also be to enable an informed decision on a second spray, e.g. to justify inclusion or omission of a second spray, or to adjust its timing. If robust control can be obtained with one spray rather than two, this will reduce costs and also minimise the development of fungicide resistance and therefore prolong the availability of effective fungicides.

In these situations the adoption of cultural approaches, such as fallowing for the worst affected areas (often combined with spring cropping within the rotation), should be considered. Project aims   The aim of this project is to add value to fallows by incorporating cover crops that can enhance weed suppression, as well as delivering the additional benefits of improved soil structure, fertility and biodiversity. Approach   - Quantify the effect of different cover cropping approaches on grass weed populations and seed return in following crops compared with conventionally managed autumn and spring cropping and fallowing. - Evaluate the potential for plant residues to suppress weed establishment and growth in a wider range of grass weed species and compare a wider range of cover crop species. - Produce robust data on the use of such approaches within integrated weed management that will detail their likely influence on system profitability. - Improve understanding of the effects of such approaches on wider parameters (eg soil systems and measures of biodiversity) and the better integration of ecosystem services into conventional crop production systems. - Develop management guidelines for the use of such cover cropping in integrated weed management. Benefits to the industry   The project outputs will provide a robust scientific evidence base to inform decisions on the potential of added value fallow systems to improve cultural approaches to weed management. In particular, the project will recommend cover cropping approaches and compositions of cover crop mixtures with specific reference to their use as short-term weed suppressing leys; develop agronomy and management guidelines for the use of such approaches; provide robust data on the use of such approaches within integrated weed management that will detail their likely influence on system profitability; improve understanding of the effects of such approaches on wider parameters (eg soil systems and measures of biodiversity) and the better integration of ecosystem services into conventional crop production systems.

No new herbicide modes of action are on the horizon. Worldwide, the ALS-inhibiting herbicide class has the greatest incidence of resistance. Resistance in poppy has already been found in the UK and is common in other European countries (eg Italy, Spain). Project aims   The project aim is to develop practical solutions to prevent a widescale increase in ALS resistant broad-leaved weeds, including common poppy ( Papaver rhoeas ), through effective management in a cereal/oilseed rape crop rotation. Approach   This project includes a three-year wheat/oilseed rape autumn rotation (two field sites) with herbicide treatments focusing on principles (selection pressures), rather than specific products, and breaks (including fallow and spring cropping). The project will be delivered through a series of field and container-based experiments to provide more detailed data and understanding. Container experiments will include up to five different poppy populations of different degrees of resistance providing a range of 'starting points' to be tested against herbicide treatments (up to 12) of varying resistance risk levels over a three-year period to assess how quickly resistance builds up. These will run in parallel with the field trial treatments to provide validation, consistency and practical implementation.   Benefits to the industry   The project outcome will help retain availability of herbicides: directly, by providing strategies to retain their efficacy; and indirectly, by providing evidence of their value in resistance management strategies. It will provide agronomists, farmers and regulators with practical guidelines for use in resistance management strategies. A significant part of the project will focus on raising awareness of the issue and communication of results and management guidelines to farmers.

Alternative herbicides, even when used in mixtures and sequences, do not offer reliable control above 90%. Field experience over the last two years has demonstrated this concern and the need to supplement alternative herbicides to iodosulfuron + mesosulfuron with other management options. Project aims To sustain predominantly winter cropping rotations where they are threatened by herbicide-resistant black-grass. Approach - Measure the impact of drilling date, crop plant population and the interaction between these two management options in combination with alternative herbicides to iodosulfuron + mesosulfuron, on the population dynamics of black-grass seed return in winter wheat. - Incorporate the data into an existing mechanistic model in order to improve the quantification of the impact of delayed sowing and crop competition in terms of control of seed return required from alternative herbicides to iodosulfuron + mesosulfuron. - To provide crop management guidelines to enable farmers to sustain predominantly winter cropping rotations in the presence of multiple-herbicide resistant black-grass. Benefits to the industry The project aims to provide information on drilling date and plant population that may sustain rotations that contain predominantly winter-sown crops and where herbicide resistance prevents high levels of black-grass control.

There is an urgent need to develop sustainable new crop varieties with greater yield potential with reduced inputs. The challenge for industry will be to achieve high yielding, cereal varieties that consistently produce high quality products that are safe, nutritious and meet end-user requirements. Therefore, BBSRC and the Scottish Government have brought together industry and the research community to support research efforts on oilseed rape, barley and wheat and their uses in food production through the development of the Crop Improvement Research Club. The project The project aims to: - Strengthen the UK research community in the areas of crop breeding, production and processing through interdisciplinary research and the provision of training - Ensure the exchange of knowledge between the science base and industry through effective networking between academic groups and companies - Develop a greater understanding of quality and yield traits and of the complex genetic and environmental factors affecting them through: The benefits This initiative has increased investment in research activity that would underpin the needs of the crop production and processing industry to address the challenge of maintaining food security. As no single organisation could hope to undertake the sort of research that CIRC enables, by clubbing together with the help of public funders, it is expected to make improvements across the industry. The anticipated output could help to reduce waste, improve quality and deliver cost savings benefitting wider society. To date, this programme is supporting 15 research projects and 10 four-year PhD studentships aligned with the funded projects.

The main threat is in annual arable crops where glyphosate provides a key role in managing grass-weeds which have developed resistance to selective herbicides. Guidance to reduce the risk of resistance development has been published by AHDB but important knowledge gaps still exist. The project The project will provide information for the development of more robust guidelines to reduce the risk of resistance development, in particular to quantify the four key principles: prevent survivors, maximise efficacy, use alternatives and monitor success. Specifically it will provide greater precision on how much glyphosate can safely be used and how often to avoid resistance evolving. The experimental work will involve a combination of both field and container-based methods. The main grass-weeds tested will be black-grass and Italian rye-grass and will investigate the two key risk periods of glyphosate application: 1) Stubbles/pre-drilling when multiple applications are applied and 2) Between crop rows when application will be to larger plants and not followed by other risk mitigation. Outcomes of the research will enable publication of more robust practical management guidelines. The project will be managed by ADAS with co-funding and collaborative involvement from the Glyphosate Task Force (through Monsanto) and four distributor companies (providing data and sites). The Black-grass Research Initiative (BGRI) will be represented on the steering group and close collaboration will be maintained through joint activity. CRD will be a regulator. The benefits The project outcome will be improved evidence leading to greater precision and detail in future management guidelines, which should significantly reduce the chances of resistance to glyphosate evolving in key grass weed species.  View a printer friendly version of this publication"	"146"	""	"-1"	"-1"	"ADAS"

Management options to control black-grass based around rotational changes or sowing date are unattractive. Understanding the basis of the evolution and spread of herbicide resistance may provide new management options to combat black-grass and will provide insights that should enable more effective management of new herbicide resistance problems early in their development. The project The project will examine the evolution and management of herbicide resistance in black-grass from the genetic to the agroecosystem level. It will focus on multiple herbicide resistance (MHR), which is underpinned by enhanced herbicide metabolism. The work addresses five key questions: Engagement of stakeholders throughout the life of the project is a central part of the work and will include the formation of a farmer’s forum and a project steering group. This large, ambitious project aims to revitalise weed research in UK universities and will place the UK at the forefront of the global fight against herbicide resistance. The benefits Benefits will accrue from a greater capacity for proactive detection and management of herbicide resistance in black-grass and other weeds. Ultimately, this will lead to the provision of more sustainable weed management strategies, a reduction in the direct impacts of weeds on crop yields and a reduction in the wasteful application of herbicides to populations where the frequency of resistance is high. The project will also provide valuable insight for the agrochemical industry on the severity and distribution of herbicide resistance and help inform appropriate policies and research to ensure the sustainable use of herbicides.

Particularly for black-grass, the most economically important weed in UK wheat, there is an unsustainable reliance on a small number of active ingredients. Without the development of more sustainable weed control strategies, the future profitability of cereal production in the UK is under serious threat. Project aims To exploit the natural variability in the suppressive ability of cereal cultivars to support integrated weed management strategies in a way that doesn't compromise weed free yield. Approach - Identify the plant traits that improve weed suppression without compromising yield under weed free conditions and quantify the value of these traits for a range of cereal cultivars on the recommended lists. - Develop simple, non-destructive screening protocols that can be used to rank new cultivars, prior to commercial release, in terms of their ability to suppress weeds using a small number of indicator traits. - Use simulation models to quantify the potential contribution of competitive cultivars to weed control in the context of integrated weed management strategies that use a combination of cultural and chemical control techniques. Benefits to the industry The combination of the database on eco-physiological traits of the varieties on the recommended list and the simulation model will result in two major deliverables to the industry: 1. Development of management guidelines on the optimal use of cultivars in sustainable weed management in combination with other cultural control options, including a cost benefit analysis of different combinations of cultural and chemical control options. 2. A practical, robust system for indexing new cereal cultivars, even before they are commercially released, in terms of their relative ability to suppress weeds on the basis of morphological traits that can be measured simply and non-destructively.

Whilst these questions persist, they are likely to inhibit the acceptance of the new threshold scheme. Also the project suggested that there is no obvious difference between the inherent tolerance of hybrid and conventional rape varieties. These findings are contrary to long-held beliefs about pollen beetle in oilseed rape and need to be re-enforced and validated by further research in order to engender confidence among farmers/agronomists. General understanding of the role of crop tolerance in crop protection is likely to become increasingly important in the future as the number of available insecticides continues to decline. The project The project will investigate the impact of different numbers of pollen beetles on the yield of winter and spring oilseed rape in the presence or absence of insecticide treatments in crops with a range of plants/m 2 and canopy size. It will simulate pollen beetle feeding damage by pruning buds to provide data on crop tolerance at a range of levels of bud loss. It will investigate the impact of pigeon grazing and plant population on the compensatory ability of plants by simulating damage using a defoliation treatment. The latest pollen beetle traps and on-line decision support tool will also be assessed. The project will provide guidelines on how best to monitor pollen beetle numbers. The benefits The proposed project will give farmers/agronomists greater confidence in assessing the risk of pollen beetle attack and facilitating the use of action thresholds. A validated integrated pest management (IPM) strategy for this pest will save growers time and money by minimising the time needed for effective pest monitoring and helping to prevent unnecessary sprays. It will also minimise the environmental impact of insecticide use in oilseed rape; in particular, it will safeguard natural enemies of pest species and other non-target organisms. Importantly, it will also limit the potential spread of pollen beetle resistance to synthetic pyrethroids. View a printer friendly version of this publication"	"146"	""	"-1"	"-1"	"ADAS"

If slugs were left totally uncontrolled they would cause losses per year of around £25 million in wheat, £18 million in oilseed rape, and £53 million across all potato sectors (ware, processing, and seed). Metaldehyde is often detected in raw water above the drinking water standard, with peaks following rainfall. While levels detected pose no danger to health or the environment, the UK’s environment agencies and Defra are responsible for the implementation of the Water Framework Directive. Unless action is taken, regulatory restrictions, or even withdrawal, may be enforced. With the recent ban of methiocarb, the understanding of slug patterns will aid in a more targeted approach to integrated pest management. The project The work commences by establishing the extent of the discontinuous distribution of slugs in commercial fields defining frequency and size range of patches. The relationship between environmental factors (e.g. soil moisture, organic matter, pH, soil type) and patch location/size will be established to improve understanding of drivers of patch formation/stability and to develop patch identification/definition approaches for precision treatment. Stability of patches (within and between years/crops) will be tested in commercial fields and the theory that population density declines towards the patch edge from a central peak will be investigated to refine patch definition. The relationship between slug population density and patch size will also be defined. A monitoring system for patch definition will be developed and linked to current commercial precision farming methods, and they will be subjected to a cost benefit analysis. The benefits Focussing on patch rather than field scale management of slugs will contribute to the strategic objective of precision inputs, which has two potential consequences: • Reduced risk of diffuse pollution and non-target effects from existing chemistry, arguably allowing use to be retained. • Improved cost effectiveness of alternatives such as biocontrol agents which would also facilitate the development of options for organic growers.   View a printer friendly version of this publication"	"146"	"Walters, Keith"	"-1"	"-1"	"Harper Adams University"

They are designed to assist decision-making relating to spraying. To receive the alerts directly to your inbox, sign up to Aphid News For the latest edition of Aphid News, please see the 'Document downloads' box on the right. How to catch an aphid A suction-trap network is used to catch aphids. The information is used to prepare AHDB Aphid News   The challenge Aphids have the potential to cause major economic problems in most UK crops through removal of sap, transmission of viruses and deposition of honeydew. The sporadic nature of aphid attacks in time and space means that prophylactic use of insecticides does not make economic sense. It also increases the risk of insecticide resistance and damages the environmental reputation of the industry. The project Suction-traps, managed by Rothamsted Research and SASA, have provided data of value in assessing aphid risk on a regional basis, and yellow water-pan traps have been deployed by Fera to assess risk at a local level from aphids to potatoes. This project is bringing together outputs from these networks to optimise information that cereal, oilseed, potato, vegetable, pea and bean growers receive. The project will provide weekly web-based information (AHDB Aphid News) on cereal, oilseed rape, potato, vegetable, pea and other pest aphids on the basis of samples from existing suction-traps; provide weekly information in autumn on numbers of cereal-colonising and bird cherry-colonising bird cherry–oat aphids at Rothamsted; provide forecasts of the phenology and early season abundance of cereal, oilseed rape and potato aphids on the basis of samples from existing suction-traps; provide weekly web-based information on cereal, oilseed rape, potato, vegetable, pea and bean aphid local distribution and abundance on the basis of yellow water-pan traps, and integrate all of the above into weekly summary bulletins for AHDB (HGCA, PCL, HDC) and PGRO. The benefits AHDB Aphid News is written using information produced through this project and provides information about when aphids are migrating at key times of the year. Suction traps and water-pan traps are used to gather regional data and show how the major aphid species have developed over the season. The first autumn migrations are reported and this information can aid decision-making on whether to spray against vectors of turnip yellows virus (TuYV) and barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV). Information in the newsletters should be used to rationalise the use of insecticides, time treatments better and reduce harm to beneficial insects. This will also lower the risk of selection for insecticide resistance by reducing unnecessary or wrongly timed sprays.

Incidence generally increases following a wet harvest period, such as in 2004 when 50% of fields had egg populations above 250/m². Between 1984 and 2010, the probability of fields having an above threshold count has ranged from 3 to 50%   Project aims   To establish the annual incidence of wheat bulb fly in the autumn to allow farmers/agronomists to decide on the need for insecticidal seed treatment and/or egg hatch or deadheart sprays. Approach   To measure the incidence of wheat bulb fly each autumn in the infested areas and to forecast the need for seed treatment or alternative insecticidal treatments. Benefits to the industry   The project will indicate the need for seed treatment against wheat bulb fly and also help to determine the likely need for egg hatch or dead heart sprays. Information on pest egg numbers is a vital component of risk assessment and will help to promote a rational approach to insecticide use against this pest. A continuation of the survey is very timely in view of the high levels of wheat bulb fly in crops in the 2011 harvest year which were predicted in the autumn 2010 survey. This will undoubtedly focus attention on wheat bulb fly for the 2011/12 season and the survey will help to address farmer/agronomist concerns.

In these areas, continuous wheat crops on heavy land have been particularly badly affected, with yield losses in the most severe cases reaching 70% in 2010 and 2011. The project The project will investigate the role of natural enemies in supressing soil populations of saddle gall midge, as well as environmental conditions such as soil moisture. In addition, the effectiveness of break crops in reducing the size of soil populations will be investigated. The project will be completed using a series of field, semi-field and laboratory experiments. The benefits An improved understanding of saddle gall midge biology and factors that may reduce the size of populations of larvae in the soil will be of benefit to cereal growers and agronomists in at-risk situations. Some growers have suffered significant financial losses from saddle gall midge damage and better information would allow these growers to manage the pest more efficiently and avoid the need for unnecessary insecticide applications that may disrupt natural enemies of other pests, such as aphids.

The occasional nature of the pest in the UK means that experience of the problem is minimal, when compared to more regular pests. The risk that this pest poses to the crop is closely linked to the size of the larval population in the soil, the proportion of the population that pupates and successfully emerges as adults and the period over which the pupation and emergence occurs. In 2012 HGCA funded a monitoring programme at a site with a known history of the pest (RD-2011-3765). It suggested that predicting the risk of crop damage from the midge is more dependent on the timing and number of adult pests that emerge rather than the number of larva in the soil. The project Project aims: 1. Monitor midge development in relation to Met data to improve understanding the pest’s life-cycle to facilitate improved forecasting of outbreaks 2.  Measure the impact of midge infestation on crop yield of wheat and barley 3.  Evaluate the efficacy of a range of timings and products for midge control 4.  Use data from objectives 1-3 to propose provisional thresholds for saddle gall midge Climatic conditions at each site will be recorded and numbers of midge developmental stages will be assessed by soil sampling between early-March and mid-June. A range of trapping methods including yellow sticky traps, yellow water traps and emergence traps will be compared. Number of attacked tillers, galls/tiller, ears/plant, grains/ear and yield/tiller will be measured comparison with uninfested plants/tillers. This will help to indicate the level of tiller infestation required to have a significant impact on crop yield. The growth stage of the crop at the time of midge emergence/egg laying and the potential for the crop to compensate will also be investigated. The experiment will compare up to three insecticides at a range of timings at both monitoring sites. The benefits An improved understanding of saddle gall midge will be of benefit to cereal growers in at-risk situations; agronomists; distributors; and the chemical industry. An improved understanding of the risk and timing of saddle gall midge attacks would allow improved targeting and timing of insecticide applications.

The 2014 winter oilseed rape (WOSR) crop was the first for which neonicotinoid seed treatments were not available to protect plants during emergence and establishment. Prior to the restriction, neonicotinoid seed treatments had been widely used to reduce damage during the establishment phase of the crop. A primary pest for which neonicotinoid seed treatments provided protection was cabbage stem flea beetle (CSFB). CSFB is estimated to affect 67% of the total OSR area, with adults feeding on the foliage of emerging crops before laying eggs at the base of plants. Hatching larvae enter the plants from mid-October, where they feed throughout the winter, moving from the petioles to the stems.   The project This project will assess CSFB larval populations in the seven counties worst affected by adult feeding (as identified in the ‘Cabbage stem flea beetle snapshot assessment’) in February and April. In each county, sampling will occur at two sites – one that had high adult CSFB pressures in the autumn and another that had low adult CSFB pressures in the autumn. Plants will be collected from selected sites, inspected for the presence of leaf scarring, and dissected to determine larval numbers. At each site, yield will be recorded at harvest and compared to the average yield for the same field over a number of years. Information will also be collected on the insecticides applied to treat CFSB.   The benefits These data will be used to contribute to a general assessment of the impact of CSFB larval pressures on crop yield and also provide supplementary information on the insecticides used for control. Comparison of the crop yield in 2014 with the average yield over a number of years will help to indicate whether the restriction on neonicotinoid use has affected crop productivity. If leaf scarring is always associated with larval invasion follow-up work could investigate how an assessment of leaf scarring could be used as a simple method of assessing CSFB larval pressure.

However, an EU imposed restriction has left growers with only one alternative of applying a pyrethroid spray. Knock-down resistance (kdr) to pyrethroids in CSFB has been confirmed in Germany and there are growing numbers of reports from UK OSR growers that pyrethroids are failing against CSFB, suggesting that resistance is now present in this country. The transmission of turnip yellows virus (TuYV) by Myzus persicae is also a major concern for OSR growers in respect of the neonicotinoid seed treatment ban. It is already estimated that 60% of UK OSR is affected by TuYV, with average yield losses in untreated crops of 15%. The loss of neonicotinoid seed treatment, combined with existing strong resistance to alternative compounds (pyrethroids and pirimicarb), will undoubtedly result in a significantly increased threat of TuYV transmission for OSR in 2014. The project The first aim of the project is to determine whether the kdr mutation conferring resistance to pyrethroids is present in UK CSFB populations and (assuming it is) to assess the approximate level of resistance it confers (using bioassays) and to obtain an estimate of mutation frequency in selected samples. The second aim is to develop a PCR-based diagnostic assay for detecting TuYV in individual M. persicae samples that will enable aphids to be tested for virus transmission potential alongside known insecticide resistance mechanisms (for which PCR assays are already available). The benefits Recent reports of poor control of CSFB with pyrethroids need to be investigated so that growers can be alerted if resistance has developed and is causing the problems. This project will establish whether the same mutation is also present in UK CSFB and will develop an assay for rapid monitoring of population for the future. Similarly, the second part of the project will aim to develop a rapid screening method for detecting TuYV in M. persicae samples. This assay will run alongside existing methods for detecting resistance mutations and will provide a more complete analysis of resistance status and the virus transmission potential of individual aphids in trap and field-caught samples.

Several limitations hinder the translation into practical guidance to constrain resistance, for example monitoring but does not directly provide guidance on anti-resistance strategies; assessment of risk is still fraught with uncertainties; choice of anti-resistance strategies is often based on fragmentary evidence from a few key pest species. Guidance needs to be strengthened and extended to all major pest problems. Project aims Our overall aim is to maintain effective chemical control of economically important pests of agriculture and horticulture by using appropriate insecticide resistance management strategies.  This will be achieved by the following objectives: 1. Compare the net benefit of different insecticide resistance management strategies for insects with contrasting life-histories and damage implications 2. Develop a method to assess insecticide resistance risk based on objective and measurable criteria  3. Transfer the new knowledge of anti-resistance strategies and risk assessment to the relevant end user communities Approach 1. Models will be applied, using existing data sets, to compare the effectiveness of resistance management strategies on resistance development for groups of pests sharing similar traits influencing their epidemiology and evolution 2. Construct and analyse a data base of insecticide resistance cases together with a quantification of those characteristics (traits) of the (i) pest species, (ii) insecticide, and (iii) agronomic system, which are likely to determine the risk of resistance.  This will generate and test a method to predict the risk of resistance development that is validated using past case-histories 3. Subject the findings to peer review, to ensure they are sound, and translate the resulting knowledge in an appropriate form for dissemination to levy payers and their advisers, by AHDB, CRD and IRAG Benefits to the industry The project will strengthen resistance management and contribute to maintaining effective chemical control of key pests.

There are three parts to the project: The organic materials being trialled are: Autumn applied - Spring applied (top-dressed) - The benefits Collectively, the results of the project will provide up to date information on the S requirement of oilseed rape and enable farmers to make better use of the S supplied by organic materials. This improved guidance is likely to result in a reduction in fertiliser S applications to crops receiving applications of organic materials, as farmers will have the information to estimate the supply of crop available S from applications of organic materials and reduce their manufactured fertiliser S use accordingly.

This is mainly because fewer fields are receiving P treatment. Over the same period, average arable crop yields have been maintained or increased. To date, there is little evidence of decreasing soil P but farmers are concerned that they may be approaching a ‘cliff edge’ of P deficiency, so that yields may soon become reduced unless P applications are resumed or increased. Fertiliser Manual (RB209) P recommendations for arable crops in England and Wales treat all soil types the same in terms of soil analytical method, critical soil P levels and advised rates of P application. However, basing current P fertiliser policy on a P-balance approach may not be right for all situations. First principles, extensive farm experience and some recent trial results indicate that soils differ, at least in rates of soil P decline and quantities of P-balance (inputs minus off-takes) required to change soil P levels. HGCA has invested in two on-going projects on P: Critical-P (Project 3554) to check whether P levels differ by soil type and Targeted P (Project 3454) to research more efficient P fertiliser products and management strategies. This project will integrate both projects, exploit established trial sites, and consolidate and extend the research. The project The specific objectives of the project are to: The benefits The primary beneficiary from this work will be arable farmers with combinable crop rotations who will be able to decide more confidently: There will also be benefits to the environment and society as reduced application is often linked to improvements in water quality.

Whilst a range of approaches are now being used on-farm to address spatial variation in N fertiliser application to cereal crops, there is not yet a comprehensive system that determines absolute N amounts and timings. Project aims To improve profitability through increased yields and optimised N inputs by developing validated commercially-viable systems for automated, fine-scale adjustment of fertiliser N applications to autumn-sown cereal crops. Approach Field experiments will be established, firstly to explain in-field variation in soil N supplies and optimum fertiliser N requirements, and whether grain N% provides a useful post-mortem on optimum N use. Secondly, to investigate the effects of genotypes, sowing dates and establishment on Green Area Indices and soil-adjusted vegetation indices. The resulting automated N management systems will then be validated using on-farm comparisons with uniform N management. Benefits to the industry Current precision of N fertiliser use is such that 43% of crops are fertilised within 50 kg/ha of the optimum N rate, automation could improve accuracy to 74%.

Currently, the challenge is that: • Revision of RB209 is infrequent and unplanned • Crop nutrient management research in the UK is uncoordinated • New research is slow to inform revision of RB209 • The usefulness and credibility of RB209 can be eroded if the status quo continued. The project The Fertiliser Manual (RB209) provides industry standard recommendations for arable and horticultural crops in England, Wales and Northern Ireland and for grassland in England and Wales. This project will review the current recommendations and additional relevant research with a view to revising RB209 and producing the AHDB Nutrient Management Guide to be released in 2017. The new guide will provide practical, robust and clear information on nutrient management to optimise economic production and minimise environmental impact by reduced nutrient loss. The review and revision of RB209 will comprise six work packages: (i) principles of crop nutrient management; (ii) organic materials; (iii) grass and forage crops; (iv) cereals and oilseeds; (v) potatoes; and (vi) horticulture. Research undertaken since 2009 will be critically evaluated for each work package with the quality of the data assessed in terms of its relevance and procedures used to provide robust scientific outputs. The benefits Growers and producers across all sectors will benefit from updated fertiliser recommendations that reflect the responses of current crop varieties to manufactured fertilisers and nutrients supplied from soil, air, crop residues and manures; and recent changes in soil and manure management practices (e.g. reduced tillage and slurry separation using new techniques and substrates). For arable, grassland, forage potato and horticulture crops this will result in higher crop yields and/or reduced inputs costs, due to better timing or amount of fertiliser applied and improved nutrient use efficiency. Advisers of all crop sectors will benefit from an improved manual that will enable them to provide accurate and up to date recommendations of greater relevance to their farmer clients, particularly for sectors with which they are less familiar. Crop and environmental scientists will benefit from a document that forms the basis of best practice in nutrient management planning against which to compare current practices and deduce implications for sustainable intensification, farm profitability and environmental impacts.

Since then, variety yield potential for both feed and malting varieties has increased and hybrid varieties have been introduced. There is now substantial evidence from several sources that the recommendations are out of date in terms of both timing and rate. Basing decisions on outdated information could be leading to a significant amount of unrealised farm profit. For the UK winter barley industry, this unrealised farm profit is estimated at approximately £25 million per year. The project The aim of this project is to review existing evidence and generate new data in order to update the Fertiliser Manual N management recommendations for winter barley. The specific objectives of the project are to: The benefits Growers of winter barley will benefit from the improved understanding of N rates and timings produced by this project. This improved knowledge will help growers obtain higher yields and grain quality and, ultimately, profits. Additional profits may also be achieved as a result of greater straw yields. This work will also help to increase the viability of winter barley to more growers. This could lead to rotational benefits as barley is usually a better entry crop for oilseed rape than winter wheat. Including winter barley in the rotation can also help to spread workloads, especially at harvest. Agronomists will benefit by having more up-to-date and reliable information to use. Malting and distilling barley end users will benefit as the guidelines will help growers to achieve the grain N specifications more consistently.

Significant challenges for wheat breeding are to stabilise yield in a changing and less predictable climate; reduce dependence on limited water and mineral resources, and to reduce CO2 emissions. These considerations are tending to drive crop production towards reduced input regimes, particularly the use of NPK fertilisers. Although recent wheat prices have been very good, this has been partly offset by the rising prices of fertiliser which have doubled since 2006. Project aims The aim of this project is to determine the impact of wheat root growth and morphology on the efficiency of nutrient uptake and hence yield and to explore how this interacts with selected environmental and agronomic parameters. This project will assess the level of genetic variation for root development in a range of wheat genotypes in controlled environments and assess the performance of a sub-set of lines with contrasting root characters under field conditions. Benefits to the industry This project will add important information on the contribution of roots to the performance of the wheat crop in the UK.

There is increasing evidence that some farms may consistently need more N than advised by the Fertiliser Manual (RB209) to achieve higher profitable yields. Other farms may consistently need less N, so savings in N fertiliser use could be made. The recent HGCA Yield Plateau (PR502) and Defra Green Food Project reports suggest that insufficient N fertiliser may be limiting yields on some farms. Farmers need to be able to determine whether or not they are getting N management right on their farm and this project will aim to help them achieve this.  The project The project will use a novel on-farm ‘strip trial’ approach that compares the standard N rate against 50kg/ha more and 50kg/ha less applied N to alternate tramlines. The work will help answer the question: ‘To what extent is N application rate constraining farm yields?’ The approach will be tested on 18 fields per year for four years across six farms to provide a detailed structured core dataset that can be used for validation. An associated network of around 12 farms will also use the approach to help provide wider evaluation, gauge variability in field-average N requirements, determine how the N optimum might be predicted and obtain feedback on how practical the approach is.  Measurements will include soil mineral N, mineralisable N, soil organic matter, soil N%, grain protein content and, where possible, canopy reflectance. Analyses will examine whether these measurements have value in indicating likely N requirements and in identifying fields or farms where N requirements are higher or lower than current recommendation systems would predict. The benefits Through this project, it is hoped that validated techniques and measures will be developed which will allow farmers to better know the N requirements of their crops. The work should give farmers greater confidence that they are applying the right N rates and, where too much N was previously being applied, benefit from fertiliser cost saving and, where too little N was previously being applied, benefit from greater yields. There will also be potential benefits to the environment and society from reduced leaching and improved water quality, if applications more than optimal are identified and subsequently reduced. More efficient N use will also help to reduce associated greenhouse gas emissions per tonne. View printer friendly versions of these publications"	"146"	""	"-1"	"-1"	"ADAS"

The UK currently lacks information from robust experiments that address the agronomic, environmental and economic impacts of soil management practices. Without detailed scientific and economic data, collected in the UK under local weather conditions, growers and agronomists will face the following challenges: Project aims This project will make best use of existing soil management experimental platforms to build understanding from: 1. Defined tillage experiments at three locations that can (a) produce vastly different soil properties, (b) assess commercially-relevant cultivation systems and (c) assess performance of different cereal varieties. 2. Comparison of plough versus reduced tillage only, in larger-scale farm sustainability experiments. 3. Knowledge exchange events: through the Centre for Sustainable Cropping at the James Hutton Institute (JHI) as well as the NIAB TAG-based platforms (including the NIAB TAG Network membership as well as the National Agronomy Centre Initiative and Innovation Farm project), coupled with HGCAhosted events. Approach This project will quantify soil properties using state-of-the-art approaches, coupled with an assessment of economic and environmental benefits. Our soil physical tests assess: Carbon storage will be assessed for a range of soil management treatments as the JHI tillage trial found no differences between reduced tillage and ploughing. The performance of a range of cereal cultivars, including Recommended List entry varieties under different soil management practices will also be assessed. This includes analysis of nutrient capture, root system responses and a root phenomics laboratory assay using intact soil cores that provides a rapid assessment of cultivar performance.

There is an urgent need to develop sustainable new crop varieties with greater yield potential with reduced inputs. The challenge for industry will be to achieve high yielding, cereal varieties that consistently produce high quality products that are safe, nutritious and meet end-user requirements. Therefore, BBSRC and the Scottish Government have brought together industry and the research community to support research efforts on oilseed rape, barley and wheat and their uses in food production through the development of the Crop Improvement Research Club. The project The project aims to: - Strengthen the UK research community in the areas of crop breeding, production and processing through interdisciplinary research and the provision of training - Ensure the exchange of knowledge between the science base and industry through effective networking between academic groups and companies - Develop a greater understanding of quality and yield traits and of the complex genetic and environmental factors affecting them through: The benefits This initiative has increased investment in research activity that would underpin the needs of the crop production and processing industry to address the challenge of maintaining food security. As no single organisation could hope to undertake the sort of research that CIRC enables, by clubbing together with the help of public funders, it is expected to make improvements across the industry. The anticipated output could help to reduce waste, improve quality and deliver cost savings benefitting wider society.

This development would lead to a more efficient use of crop biomass and improve the capture of water and soluble nutrients such as nitrate and sulphate that can otherwise be leached. Modern genetic, modelling and phenotyping techniques will be combined to help understand and optimise wheat root systems. The project The project builds upon previous AHDB Cereals & Oilseeds-funded work that showed cv. Shamrock to have greater rooting at depth and increased grain protein concentration. Shamrock had recent introgression of genetic material from wild emmer (Triticum dicoccoides) in its development which may well have contributed to its unusual rooting distribution. Following Shamrock, cvs Crusoe and Stigg have also been developed, both of which have recent introgression from wild emmer in their parentage. There is now a significant opportunity to understand this phenotype from a genetic perspective, following the production of the Shamrock x Shango doubled haploid mapping population.

For this reason, the biomass and activity of the soil organisms in farmed ecosystems is usually much less than in these natural ecosystems.    Project aims The main aim of this project is to find the minimum addition of external sources of organic matter, including making use of on-farm wastes such as straw, which brings about the maximum improvements in crop yield (grain and straw), and soil and environmental quality .   Three subsidiary aims are to : Approach     Soil quality is intimately linked with soil biology.  Certain organisms are more visible in their effects and experimental work has demonstrated a high degree of association between earthworm activity and crop yields.  Recent research at Rothamsted Research has shown that addition of Farm Yard Manure (FYM) can improve yield of barley grain and straw by more than 1 t/ha each within two years.  These results suggest that striking benefits from adding the right kind of organic matter can be achieved relatively rapidly in soils. The quality of such addition seems important because other long-term experiments on straw incorporation show little benefit following addition of far more organic carbon.    Benefits to the industry           The main target users of the information from this project are farmers and produce growers at the field scale.  This project will provide reliable guidance that shows how to raise yields over a period of a few years at relatively little outlay for a farmer. Increased yield of grain and straw also benefits the wider industry which has access to a greater volume of product, delivered with greater reliability.  Besides grain, farmers should see an increase in straw mass, which currently has a reasonable value for bedding or fuel.

These maps contain important information about the variation of fields, but it is not clear how this information can be fully exploited for management decisions.   There are several difficulties associated with the generation and interpretation of yield maps. There are statistical ones in creating the maps, because the yield monitor data is often noisy and contain artifacts and there is no general consensus on the best analysis methods. When a low-yielding region is identified the farmer is often unsure how to respond because there are many factors which could limit the yield. There is also variation between maps from different seasons, so a single map does not capture the full variability. Project aims The main aim of this project is to determine when it is cost-effective for farmers to use yield maps and management zones to guide soil management decisions. The work will devise protocols for the robust and efficient implementation of yield maps and management zones. Approach This project will investigate existing yield maps and complementary soil data to determine the best methods of exploiting yield information and when this is costeffective. Clear guidelines will be produced so that farmers are able to analyse yield monitor data. Improved yield mapping software will also be produced and made freely available. However, this might be not possible if tests show that complex statistical algorithms are required. The researchers will coordinate with precision agriculture advisory companies so that they can implement the recommendations on behalf of levy payers. Benefits to the industry The eventual beneficiaries of the project outputs will be farmers who will benefit from an improved understanding of the variation within fields. The magnitude of these benefits, in terms of increased profit and reduced environmental impact, will be quantified during the project. Field experiments, conducted in HGCA Project 267 in 2002, suggested that the financial benefits of variable N management could be as much as £22/ha (£48/ha at current prices).

"RD-2010-3699"	"Modern triticale crops for increased yields, reduced inputs, increased profitability and reduced greenhouse gas emissions from UK cereal production"	"http://cereals.ahdb.org.uk/publications/2013/january/21/modern-triticale-crops-for-increased-yields,-reduced-inputs,-increased-profitability-and-reduced-greenhouse-gas-emissions-from-uk-cereal-production.aspx"	"2012"	"2013"	"  The challenge Recent ADAS and HGCA research has shown that triticale regularly out-yields wheat, even in high yielding situations, and is likely to require less N fertiliser and pesticides. This project aims to understand how triticale outperforms wheat in order to better predict the situations when it should be grown, as well as communicating the knowledge gained from the wider project to levy payers. Such knowledge could also give important insight to aid improvement of wheat crops generally, by identifying important traits to breed improved varieties with higher yields and reduced N requirements. Through extra measurements and by using the HGCA knowledge transfer systems we propose that this HGCA add-on project would: 1) Understand the causes of the differences in yield and nitrogen requirement between wheat and triticale, through understanding differences in the important yield forming processes of N uptake, canopy formation, light interception, dry matter accumulation and partitioning, as well as the duration of important growth phases (such as grain filling) and, importantly, differences in rooting depth, root biomass and root length through the soil profile, as well as differences in take-all resistance. 2) By reporting results produced in the TSB project, demonstrate the potential of modern triticale varieties to improve profitability for levy payers, through increased grain and straw yields and reduced inputs, as well as to reduce greenhouse gas costs and improve the sustainability of animal feed and bioethanol supply chains. This add-on project will allow the full results from the TSB project to be communicated to the industry through HGCA knowledge transfer systems. The project The aim of this HGCA-funded project is to add value through improving the underlying science and understanding of the questions relevant to arable growers, and by providing additional communication with growers and other stakeholders through the normal HGCA KT mechanisms. Specifically, we propose assessment of: Items which will be addressed separately through a concurrent TSB project will include lodging risk (incidence of lodging and measurement of crop height) and assessments of ear fertility. The work will be centred on modern varieties which we have shown to be higher yielding (mean 9.6 t/ha over 11 sites) than triticale yields in the 1980’s (ca. 7.3 t/ha). Agronomic options will be addressed through the work of commercial partner Agrovista who are leading the TSB proposal and who will ensure that appropriate crop protection products are used, and SOLAs applied for where required.    The benefits UK wheat growers will benefit directly in situations where triticale is shown to give higher gross margins than wheat. If the results found in 9 of 11 trials conducted over the past 4 years are representative of UK cereal production then triticale offers a huge opportunity for the arable industry to increase yields and reduce inputs. The obvious opportunity for triticale lies in the second or later cereal position, where its greater resistance or tolerance to Take-All gives the greatest advantage, but our results to date suggest it may also be worth considering as a first cereal. Over 50% of cereals grown in the UK are used for animal feed, and there seems to be little reason why much of this could not be met with triticale rather than wheat or barley. Chemical analysis of grain samples from modern triticale varieties will be used to assess nutritional composition to confirm earlier work indicating that triticale grain and DDGS has feeding value for pigs and ruminants equivalent to or greater than that of wheat. Bioethanol production will create an additional market for triticale, if the related TSB project is successful in demonstrating to UK bioethanol producers that triticale can be used in refineries without processing problems and that it has better environmental credentials than wheat. It therefore seems likely that the price discount that triticale suffers should reduce with time, or disappear completely, further enhancing the profitability of the crop. Through improving the understanding of N uptake and utilisation by triticale, the project will provide recommendations for improved crop management of triticale by growers. Current N recommendations are based on research done over 20 years ago, and so may be too low (though the correct recommendations are still likely to be less than for wheat). This project will also provide useful information on current and new triticale varieties, as there is currently no Recommended List for triticale, only a Descriptive List with two trials per year grown with little N fertiliser and without a fungicide programme. The related TSB project will include trials by Agrovista to establish appropriate crop protection strategies for triticale, which will be publicised alongside the results of this HGCA work. Breeders should benefit from an increased market for triticale, which will allow greater investment in triticale varieties. Current triticale varieties have been bred in continental Europe with little or no breeding activity specific to the UK environment. If these current varieties can out-perform the best wheat varieties, which receive large investment from breeders, then it might be expected that triticale varieties bred specifically for the UK in the future could do better still. The emergence of triticale as a broad acre crop could also give large environmental benefits through reduced N fertiliser inputs, and possibly also reduced agro-chemical inputs, increased biodiversity within arable systems, and increased genetic variation for disease and pest resistance. Additionally, because triticale inherits from rye a better ability to scavenge water it could provide more resilient cropping systems in an environment where water resources become scarcer.

The Sustainable Agriculture Research and Innovation Club (SARIC) is a joint BBSRC and NERC initiative to support innovative projects that will provide solutions to key challenges affecting the efficiency, productivity and sustainability of the UK crop and livestock sectors. The project The agricultural industry has a significant impact upon the UK’s economy and environment. The industry has around 150,000 businesses in the UK, which is 6% of the total, and employs 660,000 people. The sector contributes £9.9 billion to UK GDP through production of both livestock and crops. In 2014 the Utilised Agricultural Area was 17.2M hectares, which is 71% of land in the UK. SARIC was created as a public-private partnership that will enhance the efficiency, productivity and sustainability of our agricultural systems. The club will enable the UK research base to contribute to the substantial innovation opportunities connected with the sustainable intensification of agriculture. Over five years SARIC will invest in activities in the research base that translate existing knowledge and generate new insights to benefit the UK. The activities will bring together multidisciplinary teams in novel collaborations with expertise from the biological, environmental, economic and social sciences. The benefits BBSRC, NERC and ESRC have a strong record in managing collaborative research programmes, including the Research Innovation Club mechanism. Companies report a range of significant benefits from their engagement with the Research Councils: • Capacity to influence research in important strategic areas • Knowledge on the progress of relevant research projects and early access to results • Opportunity to work with leading researchers and to build strong relationships with them • Opportunity to identify the best potential industry recruits • Guidance on other Research Council activities and funding opportunities • Promotion of companies through relevant activities, objectives and outputs View a printer friendly version of this publication"	"146"	""	"-1"	"-1"	"BBSRC"

There is an urgent need to develop sustainable new crop varieties with greater yield potential with reduced inputs. The challenge for industry will be to achieve high yielding, cereal varieties that consistently produce high quality products that are safe, nutritious and meet end-user requirements. Therefore, BBSRC and the Scottish Government have brought together industry and the research community to support research efforts on oilseed rape, barley and wheat and their uses in food production through the development of the Crop Improvement Research Club. The project The project aims to: - Strengthen the UK research community in the areas of crop breeding, production and processing through interdisciplinary research and the provision of training - Ensure the exchange of knowledge between the science base and industry through effective networking between academic groups and companies - Develop a greater understanding of quality and yield traits and of the complex genetic and environmental factors affecting them through: The benefits This initiative has increased investment in research activity that would underpin the needs of the crop production and processing industry to address the challenge of maintaining food security. As no single organisation could hope to undertake the sort of research that CIRC enables, by clubbing together with the help of public funders, it is expected to make improvements across the industry. The anticipated output could help to reduce waste, improve quality and deliver cost savings benefitting wider society. To date, this programme is supporting 15 research projects and 10 four-year PhD studentships aligned with the funded projects.

Data used in LCA may also be interpreted from the perspective of resource use efficiency, in terms which are potentially more meaningful for primary producers, striving to optimise productivity within sustainable farming businesses. Existing tools generally focus on a single enterprise but managers' decisions on resource use can have effects on several enterprises on a farm. There is a need for a calculator that can examine the overall resource use across enterprises on a farm. AHDB wishes to build awareness and understanding in their stakeholder communities of the way that farm management decisions on the use of resources (including land) determine environmental impacts. This project is being undertaken to explore, develop and deliver a computer-based “resource use efficiency calculator” for use in the organisation’s interactions with UK farming and supply chain businesses. The project will result in calculator that will calculate other established LCA criteria including: primary energy use (PEU); global warming potential (GWP); acidification; eutrophication; abiotic resource use; pesticide use; land requirement and extracted water use to enable a comprehensive life-cycle inventory (LCI) of the environmental burdens and resource use to be established. The project The main aim of the project is: to develop a AHDB Resource Use Efficiency Calculator to build awareness and understanding of how farm management decisions on the use of resources (including land) determine environmental impacts and associated economic impacts. A further aim is: to show how a user-friendly, computer-based AHDB Resource Use Efficiency Calculator can be used in AHDB’s interactions with UK farming and supply chain businesses, to investigate the outcomes from possible changes that might be made to farming systems. This work will develop a new calculator specifically tailored to the needs of the AHDB that will not be a refinement of existing sector-specific calculators. The consortium will draw on the learning from existing resource use/environmental impact decision support tools already developed by the consortium members, including the PAS2050 certified calculator from SRUC and incorporate this knowledge into the AHDB Resource Use Efficiency (RUE) Calculator. The calculator consists of a number of key components: The benefits This work will develop a new calculator specifically tailored to the needs of the AHDB that will not be a refinement of existing sector-specific calculators.

"RD-2010-3772"	"Agricultural biomass supply chain greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting"	"http://cereals.ahdb.org.uk/publications/2013/january/21/agricultural-biomass-supply-chain-greenhouse-gas-(ghg)-reporting.aspx"	"2012"	"2013"	"  The challenge UK agriculture is likely to have a crucial role in biomass production for the renewable heat, power and transport fuel sectors in the future, as sustainability standards are developed and introduced, and the ability or attractiveness to import cheaper (perhaps less sustainable feedstocks) is reduced. The Renewable Energy Directive (RED) has set ambitious targets for the EU, aiming for a 20% contribution from renewable energy by 2020. In order to achieve these targets, each member state has published a Renewable Energy Action Plan (REAP) which sets out their desired delivery mechanisms. The UKs response is the Renewable Energy Strategy (RES) which defines how the overall target of 15% of our energy mix coming from renewables by 2020 will be delivered. This is broken down as 10% of transport fuels, 14% of heat and 32% of power coming from renewables. A number of policy instruments are in place to incentivise renewable energy generation; Under the RTFO and the RO, aimed at larger-scale generators, there are carbon and sustainability reporting requirements which are currently voluntary. However, from 2013 reports will become mandatory and, eventually, generators are expected to be rewarded according to the GHG savings made. Initially generators will be able to use EU default values for reporting GHG savings; as little information is available, these default values are conservative and only just allow most supply chains to achieve the minimum criteria. However, as more data becomes available or is fed into the calculation, the accuracy increases and the GHG targets are more easily achieved. Domestically supplied feedstock relying on EU default values achieves the minimum criteria; however, with actual data this could be improved. There is a significant opportunity to improve the quality and availability of data to demonstrate how domestic feedstocks can exceed the required GHG savings by following good agricultural practice and to prepare suppliers and generators for the future. Bioethanol from wheat, biodiesel from oilseed rape and bio-electricity from energy crops are the three main biomass-supply chains to which the UK supplies feedstock. These are the three areas under scrutiny in this project, with the aim of improving data availability and quality, to move from relying on the conservative default values to using more accurate actual values. Using biofuels as an example, the default values suggest a 36% GHG saving for FAME biodiesel from oilseed rape and a 26% saving for bioethanol from wheat. However, when using actual values it is thought that this saving can be increased to 65 and 75% respectively. Likewise in renewable power, savings of 60% are proposed to eventually be linked to the receipt of Renewables Obligation Certificates (ROCs); although UK energy crops are thought to be capable of exceeding this target, data is not widely available and has not yet been verified. The project This project is intended to collate and present greenhouse gas (GHG) data representing the UK agricultural supply chain for three industrial use crops; oilseed rape for biodiesel, wheat for bioethanol and miscanthus for bio-power. Data collated from relevant industrial contributors will be run through official GHG reporter tools hosted by Ofgem. Outputs will be presented as summary case studies to illustrate how UK feedstocks can achieve and exceed the desired savings, in order for generators and producers to remain eligible for the respective financial incentives in the future. The outputs of the project are intended to inform farmers, advisers, policy makers and industry.    The benefits Farmers The case studies would be helpful to growers of wheat, oilseed rape and miscanthus to understand how easy it is for them to supply sustainable feedstock by following standard good agricultural practice in the UK. The case studies would also highlight where they can make improvements in the management of their crops, to improve on the carbon intensity figure to potentially make their feedstocks even more attractive to UK generators. This could eventually carry a price premium post-April 2013 when incentives are likely to be linked to the carbon intensity of a given supply chain. Advisors The case studies will allow advisers, agronomists and consultants to prepare farmers to supply sustainable biomass to the renewable energy sector, following good agricultural practice standards, in the same way as the farmers would benefit, as outlined above. Policy makers The results will provide policy makers with sufficient evidence to allow them to justify the carbon intensity thresholds and the potential for achieving these thresholds with UK feedstocks. The case studies will be valuable for demonstrating how UK biomass can make a significant and sustainable contribution to our ambitious renewable energy targets Industry Following the recent Committee on Climate Change (CCC) Bioenergy review, suggesting the carbon intensity figure should be further reduced for solid biomass to power from 285kgCo2/t to 200kgCO2/t, industry would benefit by understanding the value of sustainable domestic feedstocks and the importance of them for meeting the desired savings, and remaining eligible for the financial incentives post April 2013.

However there has been undue reliance on imported soya as the main protein source which has recently raised environmental issues relating to land use change and, specifically, the release of carbon from cropping of high carbon stock soils. Replacement of imported feedstuffs with Distillers Dried Grains with Solubles (DDGS), produced as a result of distilling and bioethanol production, could have a significant positive impact on energy and nutrient utilisation and reduce levels of imported protein. Currently around 250 kt/annum of DDGS from the distilling industry is used in animal feed but supply will increase to 960 kt/annum with the opening of new bioethanol plants by Ensus in 2009 and Vivergo in 2010. However, the goal of replacing imported feedstuffs, including soya bean meal, requires optimisation of all the processes involved to ensure that nutritive value is maximised. Project aims To quantify sources of variability in DDGS, identify opportunities to enhance their value, to consider innovative processes to reduce fibre content (for non-ruminants) and to quantify the contribution of co-products to the overall GHG balance of UK crop, livestock and ethanol production. Approach - Quantify the chemical composition of UK sources of DDGS and other co-products - Quantify the nutritional value of UK sources of DDGS and other co-products in both ruminant and non-ruminant species - Identify routes to improving nutritional value of DDGS - Quantify the overall benefits of DDGS production on reducing diffuse pollutants, and enhancing home-grown protein production Benefits to the industry A more consistent DDGS product and an improved understanding of livestock performance and diet inclusion rates will benefit the arable and livestock industries. Because all parts of the supply chain - from grain procurement through biofuels producers and distillers to end users of co-products - are participating in the project information can be communicated to the entire industry. This will work at various levels, through nutrition experts, trade bodies, food suppliers and the biofuels industry themselves as standards for grain and DDGS develop over the coming years.

Consequently, when grown under low input conditions such varieties have considerable yield and quality shortfalls (4 to 5 t/ha modal range). This reduced productivity is the result of the interaction between varieties that have not been selected for production under low-input conditions, and the field environments that are often highly variable in the absence of a range of inputs. Project aims The overall aim of the project is to improve the performance and stability of performance of winter wheat under environmental conditions that are forecast to become more unpredictable and more costly to ameliorate through inputs. Approach The performance and stability of performance of wheat Composite Cross Populations (CCPs) will be determined over a wide range of environmental conditions and related to phenotypic and genotypic analysis. Benefits to the industry - Increased economic returns from high and stable yield and quality over diverse environments. - Decreased cereal production costs from reduced agrochemical inputs (whilst maintaining yield and quality). - Potential reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, e.g. by reducing inputs and by improved fermentation efficiency of grain production to be used for biofuels. - Marketing 'edge' for small scale producers, organic, low input or non-organic from locally adapted CCPs. - Unique products will support local food supply networks.

There is now an opportunity to provide an early indication of regional fusarium risks within the season that can be used by farmers during the completion of their risk assessments to improve accuracy, and by the supply chain, to get a better understanding of regional in-season risks. The project The overall aim is to improve the information available on fusarium infection risk during flowering to raise awareness amongst farmers of mycotoxin risks, to aid accurate completion of mycotoxin risk assessments and increase reliability of information, and to give an early indication of season regional mycotoxin risks for the supply industry. This would be achieved through: 1. Monitoring and reporting – Run weekly fusarium infection risk monitoring from ear emergence (mid-May) to end of flowering (early July) covering 30 counties in GB and provide six reports on fusarium infection risk in each year. 2. Validation – Undertake targeted harvest mycotoxin DON test results to compare to monitoring. 3. Develop methodology and pilot use of early season mycotoxin testing (between flowering and harvest). The benefits The project would provide more accurate level of information around the fusarium infection risk at flowering. Weekly reporting will aim to raise farmer’s awareness of the local fusarium infection risk, and subsequent concerns of mycotoxin. This would allow farmers will take action to minimise the mycotoxin risks in their grain, e.g. through timely ear wash applications, or through segregation and appropriate marketing of high risk crops. The early indication of fusarium infection risk should provide the industry with an early warning of mycotoxin hot spots that may need greater focus on testing if grain is purchased from those regions.

Many regions in Europe are having to down-grade their malting specifications to source sufficient intake due to inclement climatic conditions. Drought during grain fill can result in increased grain N content and failing to achieve malting specifications, particularly in Eastern England, where much English malting barley is sourced. Such drought conditions are likely to become more frequent and will affect the spring crop much more than the winter crop, which can escape the worst effects of summer drought through a much earlier maturity. Whilst winter barley might therefore provide a more consistent supply, the proportion bought by English maltsters has declined by more than 25% over the past 20 years. Project aims The project aims to: • Utilise knowledge gained from a previous project to introgress specific genetic loci associated with malting quality from the spring into the winter crop, in order to bring the overall quality level of the winter crop up to that of the spring.  Benefits to the industry The information from this project will help breeders identify the best crosses to make to achieve specific breeding goals such as improved malting quality. This in turn will benefit the malting, brewing and distilling industries as it will improve the efficiency and sustainability of their businesses. In addition, the greater availability of winter malting barley varieties that meet distillers requirements will benefit the industry as the higher yield of the winter crop means that potential supply problems from an increased demand can better be met from the home market rather than resorting to imports.

In the UK, losses average in the order of £12-20 million per annum, despite significant expenditure on fungicides. Few sources of eyespot resistance are known, the most potent being the gene Pch1. Wheat varieties carrying the segment of chromosome which holds Pch1 are highly resistant to eyespot and give a higher grain protein content than expected for their yield. However, these varieties also suffer a yield penalty. The project The project will determine the relative position of genes for the three traits and produce plant material to isolate eyespot resistance and increased protein content from reduced yield. DNA markers will also be developed to allow breeders to track the three traits in their breeding programmes, allowing selection for the desirable traits and removal of the unwanted yield loss trait. The benefits The materials developed in this project will feed into breeding programmes and eventually into commercially available varieties. This will directly benefit plant breeders, and subsequently growers, through the availability of eyespot resistant wheat varieties with high yield and high grain protein content. These eyespot resistant varieties will require a reduced fungicide application, contributing to improved profitability for growers as well as environmental benefits, whilst the improved grain protein quality will allow breeders to produce varieties suitable for milling.

AFBI has previously shown that near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has the potential to accurately predict broilers performance when offered a diet based on particular wheats. However, these predictions were based on experimental conditions only. It has been suggested that the moisture content of grain at harvest and subsequent drying conditions have a detrimental effect on feed quality but there is a lack of documentary information for this assertion and requires further investigation.

However, relatively little is known of its physical basis, and results can be affected by growing conditions and on the measurement method used. Several studies suggest that hectolitre weight may not measure milling quality adequately. A key factor affecting milling yield is the kernel content and accurate testing for this is time-consuming, labour-intensive and costly using existing methods. The project The project aims to: The benefits Oat millers: This project has support from oat millers who currently use hectolitre weight to assess milling quality of oats. They will also benefit by assuring the sustainability of the UK oat crop. Arable Producers: will benefit as current methods of assessing hectolitre weight often result in the rejection of the crop or a reduction of its value. Understanding the components leading to improved milling yield without compromising agronomic yield would result in a better fit of cereals to market requirements, thus maintaining and enhancing their value and the size of the market for UK cereals. Understanding the influence of environment and management on grain quality will enable growers to develop practises that maximise high milling quality oats.

The Sustainable Agriculture Research and Innovation Club (SARIC) is a joint BBSRC and NERC initiative to support innovative projects that will provide solutions to key challenges affecting the efficiency, productivity and sustainability of the UK crop and livestock sectors. The project The agricultural industry has a significant impact upon the UK’s economy and environment. The industry has around 150,000 businesses in the UK, which is 6% of the total, and employs 660,000 people. The sector contributes £9.9 billion to UK GDP through production of both livestock and crops. In 2014 the Utilised Agricultural Area was 17.2M hectares, which is 71% of land in the UK. SARIC was created as a public-private partnership that will enhance the efficiency, productivity and sustainability of our agricultural systems. The club will enable the UK research base to contribute to the substantial innovation opportunities connected with the sustainable intensification of agriculture. Over five years SARIC will invest in activities in the research base that translate existing knowledge and generate new insights to benefit the UK. The activities will bring together multidisciplinary teams in novel collaborations with expertise from the biological, environmental, economic and social sciences. The benefits BBSRC, NERC and ESRC have a strong record in managing collaborative research programmes, including the Research Innovation Club mechanism. Companies report a range of significant benefits from their engagement with the Research Councils: • Capacity to influence research in important strategic areas • Knowledge on the progress of relevant research projects and early access to results • Opportunity to work with leading researchers and to build strong relationships with them • Opportunity to identify the best potential industry recruits • Guidance on other Research Council activities and funding opportunities • Promotion of companies through relevant activities, objectives and outputs View a printer friendly version of this publication"	"146"	""	"-1"	"-1"	"BBSRC"
"217-0002 (71282)"	"Mycotoxin contamination: assessment of risk in livestock system"	"http://cereals.ahdb.org.uk/publications/2014/august/18/mycotoxin-contamination-assessment-of-risk-in-livestock-system.aspx"	"2014"	"2015"	"The challenge Mycotoxins at high concentrations can have a direct impact on animal health and welfare. Such conditions are rarely seen in the UK. However, at lower concentrations mycotoxins can impact on livestock performance such as decreased litter weights and reduced feed conversion rates, all of which have a direct effect on farm profitability. Currently, the main information source for livestock farmers is companies with a vested interest in the sale of mycotoxin binders/ absorbents/ biotransformation microbes/enzymes. More information is required to be able to provide independent advice for farmers on the prevalence of mycotoxins, risk factors and mitigation strategies. The project The aim is to carry out a three-stage, desk-based review. This will be carried out by researchers with experience of mycotoxins, cereal crops/agronomy and livestock (veterinary and husbandry). It will cover methods for testing mycotoxins in feed, forage, bedding and animals; potential effects on different species with a view to formulating prevention and mitigation strategies in order to reduce mycotoxin exposure effects. Information will be collected from many sources including published scientific literature and grey literature/trade journals. Direct information of mycotoxin issues and other anecdotal evidence will be collected from farmers and industrial sources by survey to ensure all possible information sources are captured. The benefits The main information sources for livestock farmers are companies who may have a vested interest in the sale of mycotoxin binders, absorbents and bio-transformation microbes/enzymes. The review will provide an objective summary of the UK situation with respect to mycotoxins in livestock and highlight research gaps. There will be a series of 1-page key recommendation fact sheets for farmers per livestock species - beef cattle, dairy cattle and pigs. Such information would provide independent advice for farmers on the prevalence of mycotoxins, risk factors and mitigation strategies.

"RD-2011-3779"	"Monitoring of mycotoxins and other contaminants in UK cereals used in malting, milling and animal feed"	"http://cereals.ahdb.org.uk/publications/2012/august/01/monitoring-of-mycotoxins-and-other-contaminants-in-uk-cereals-used-in-malting,-milling-and-animal-feed.aspx"	"2012"	"2016"	"  The challenge Issues relating to food and feed safety and the public perception of wholesomeness, are crucial for market confidence and competitiveness. In recent years, public confidence has been shaken by incidents such as BSE and dioxins in animal feed. Levels of  mycotoxins  and pesticides in cereal-based foods continue to be a major focus of EU legislation, and reported exceedances can undermine the acceptability of UK grain in domestic and overseas markets. The project The project aims to: The benefits This project will help assure cereal processors that their raw materials are safe for human and animal consumption. It will generate new data on areas of concern for the cereals industry regarding chemical food safety to build on existing information. Horizon scanning will identify emerging risks and alert HGCA and associated stakeholders (MAGB, NABIM, and AIC) to issues of concern. This will help prepare the industry in cases of future problems and changes in legislation. View printer friendly versions of these publications"	"146"	"Byrd, Nick"	"-1"	"-1"	"Campden Technology Ltd"
"RD-2012-3804"	"Supporting UK malting barley with improved market intelligence on grain skinning"	"http://cereals.ahdb.org.uk/publications/2013/july/23/supporting-uk-malting-barley-with-improved-market-intelligence-on-grain-skinning.aspx"	"2013"	"2016"	"  The challenge Grain skinning in barley is a major grain quality issue affecting the malting process and can lead to intake rejections. Reports from across several years suggest that new spring barley varieties are increasingly susceptible to this condition. There were widespread reports of grain skinning in spring barley crops from harvest 2012. Strong varietal influences on grain skinning have previously been identified, with some varieties rated as having a low, moderate or high susceptibility. A concern from growers is the apparent lack of choice in robust malting barley varieties, including those with good resistance to skinning. There are also strong environmental influences on grain skinning, with the condition appearing to be more prevalent after extended grain-fill periods, particularly with prolonged wet weather (as in 2012) or intermittent wet and dry weather. The project The project will use targeted field screening trials to improve our understanding of the main risk factors. It will collate data from 4 harvests, 2012 - 2015, as well as looking at historical harvest data. The work will include: (1) An extensive survey of grain across UK regions (2) Updates on seasonal variation in skinning (3) Assessments of skinning in existing HGCA RL trials (4) Assessments of skinning from targeted variety screening trials The benefits This project could  help deliver the following outcomes for supply-chain beneficiaries: (1) The UK malting industry, brewers and distillers will make significant savings in handling and processing costs by using a more reliable supply of quality grain.  (2) Farmers will be able to grow more robust varieties, ensuring that skinning does not affect their malting premium, together with the associated transport costs. (3) Supporting plant breeding with additional evaluation of variety robustness and thus help target their objectives to meet future market specifications.
