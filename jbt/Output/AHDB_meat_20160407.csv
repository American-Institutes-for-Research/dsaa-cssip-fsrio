" 72503"	"Yield from beef carcases across the classification grid "	"http://beefandlamb.ahdb.org.uk/research/meat-eating-quality-and-safety/meat-eating-quality-and-safety-beef/beef-carcase-yield/"	"2008"	"2009"	"Carcase classification provides a description of a carcase to facilitate trade.  This is linked to the commercial value of carcases, based on an assumed relationship with yield of saleable meat for specific market requirements. A considerable amount of work was undertaken in the early 1980s relating conformation and fat class to carcase lean meat percentage and yield.  An objective assessment of the relationship between classification scores and meat yield has not been undertaken, however, since that time.  In that intervening period market requirements have changed, in particular in relation to trimming specifications.  Furthermore, the type of cattle produced has been changing.  Of particularly note is the change in the genetic make-up of the dairy herd, where Holstein genes now predominate.   Project Aims:   "	"The work was carried out in a commercial cutting facility in collaboration with an industry partner.  Overall, 200 beef sides were selected to cover the central portion of the classification grid based on the distribution of prime beef in the grid in England, with those cells with 2% or more of the population forming the basis of the selection, plus -U4H cattle to complete the central portion of the grid. Sides were individually broken down to trimmed primals, lean trim, fat trim and bone and waste using a commercial butchery specification. Regression analysis was carried out to establish the yields of primals by classification class. Results: Both fat class and conformation class have significant effects on the yield of saleable meat from the carcase with a difference in yield of 11% of the side weight when moving from U-2 to O-4H for example.  For an average carcase weight from this sample (289.2kg) this represents a difference of 31.8kg.  Even on the cautious assumption that all the additional weight is trim, at a wholesale value of £3.30 for 93% VL trim (commercial price as at April 2011) this represents £104.94 per carcase. Fat trim makes up the majority of difference in saleable yield between sides of different classification scores. While visual carcase classification has some disadvantages, these results clearly show that it remains a useful tool for the assessment of carcase value. This project has given an improved understanding of the link between classification and yield.  This will help industry assess the value of carcases and enable abattoirs to better reward for those carcases that have higher inherent value (and penalise those that have lower value).  This information also informs the discussion on the value of other carcase assessment methods (e.g. VIA) by providing a benchmark against which any added value of other methods can be compared.   Planned activity: Calculator has been created and added to EBLEX trade website: www.qsmbeefandlamb.co.uk/yield-calculator     "	"146"	"-1"	"Eblex Technical Team"

It is relatively easy to identify whether some practices are in place, for example hip suspension.  It is less easy to identify whether the less obvious requirements (eg maturation period) have been adopted.  If they have, supplier monitoring may be insufficient to ensure that they are adhered to. The EBLEX Board is concerned that there is an undesirable, and avoidable, degree of variation in the toughness of English beef at retail. This project is aimed at identifying whether such variation exists at the major multiple retailers in two important beef cuts.  The sampling of English beef at retail also provides the opportunity to undertake some analyses to verify the origin of that beef. One factor that may influence that eating quality of beef is variation in the age of animals at slaughter.  While a definitive determination of animal age is not possible from a meat sample, an examination of collagen cross-linking can provide information on the variation in physiological age.   Project Aims: To sample beef from 6 multiple retailer outlets and undertake the following assessments:   "	"This project involved sampling beef from major retail outlets and undertaking shear force tests for toughness, as well as a range of tests to assess the origin and variation in age of the beef.   Results: The results showed considerable variability in the toughness of beef from English abattoirs available at retail in England.  While beef of good quality is available from all supply chains, variation means that there are unacceptably tough samples in several multiple retailer offerings.  Those retailers specifying hip suspension, have generally lower shear values than those with other post-slaughter procedures. The Bos Indicus test results show that this is not contributing to this range in toughness.  Origin results suggest all the beef sampled is of British origin, and collagen cross links suggest extreme animal age is not a factor.   Planned activity: Individual abattoir companies will be briefed on their own results.  These results underpin EBLEX’s approach to knowledge transfer on meat eating quality.   "	"146"	"-1"	"Eblex Internal"

Flavour also increases during ageing and there is an argument that “dry ageing? results in better flavour than “wet ageing.? Prior to the development of vacuum packaging, meat was dry-aged. Dry aging consists of placing unpackaged meat in a chiller  under controlled temperature, humidity and airflow. Wet ageing is widely used in commercial beef production in England. This involves storage of the meat in vacuum packs, usually for 7 to 21 days. The main disadvantage of dry ageing is the weight loss as a result of two main factors: evaporative loss resulting in reduced water content of the meat (considered an important component of the improved quality) and discolouration/desiccation of externally exposed muscle, which requires trimming. To counter this, dry ageing in a bag that is highly permeable to water vapour has been investigated.   Project Aims: 1. To compare the weight loss and eating quality of beef sirloin subjected to traditional dry ageing, vacuum packaged ageing in a standard vacuum pouch and ageing in a permeable bag.   "	"Ageing was carried out in a commercial plant using sections of loin matured by the three methods: not packaged for maturation; vacuum packaged in standard vacuum pouch; and vacuum packaged in permeable film. The weight losses (evaporative and trim losses) were assessed at the end of ageing. Loin sections were subjected to sensory analysis at the University of Bristol.   Results:  The ageing of meat in permeable packaging resulted in a marked improvement in yield, although standard vacuum packaging reduces this further.  The flavour developed was similar to that from traditional dry aging, which was not liked by the University of Bristol sensory panel.  In fact the “abnormal flavour” of the permeable bag product was higher than traditional dry aging which was higher than vacuum pack.  It could be concluded  that ageing in a permeable bag mimics the flavour development of dry aged beef while reducing weight loss.  It would be prudent to undertake evaluation with target consumers before implementing any changes in practice.   "	"146"	"-1"	"Eblex Technical Team"

However, there is no information on the prevalence or amount of CNS contamination of heads and head meat from cattle slaughtered in UK abattoirs and therefore no basis for an assessment of public health risk from these sources should a slaughtered animal be carrying the BSE infectious agent. There are many factors that have potential to introduce substantial variability in the degree of contamination of head meat, including abattoir practices and subsequent moving and storage of heads if harvesting meat is performed off-line or in separate premises.  Currently head meat can only be removed in the abattoir but there is the potential to allow head meat to be removed in licensed cutting plants.  The data generated in this study will help inform decisions on future guidelines.   Project Aims:   "	"A comprehensive evaluation of the contamination of bovine heads and head meat by CNS material will be based on current industry practices and on a simulation of procedures that would be used if heads were processed at cutting plants. Contamination will be quantified using CNS marker protein(s) and will be measured on head meat after different handling and harvesting methods.   Results: The commercially available Ridascreen® Risk material 10/5 test kit, sold by R-Biopharm Ltd, was selected for use in this project. A comprehensive validation of this kit was performed, which included optimisation of the kit parameters to produce reliable and reproducible data, correlation of % CNS tissue to concentration of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), calibration using a traceable source of GFAP and accurate estimation of the limit of detection. Brain stem homogenates were used for quality assurance purposes to establish good and reproducible recoveries of added CNS material. To date, this has not been done in a quantitative manner by other workers in this field. Data produced in the validation of the kit showed that the optimised R-Biopharm kit was: To accompany the optimised R-Biopharm kit for the determination of CNS tissue, a swabbing protocol for use in busy abattoirs was developed. This involved the investigation and optimisation of swab type, swab area, swabbing medium, number of swabs to take, successive extractions, swab equilibration period and swab stability. The developed swabbing protocol was successfully tested in this project and it has been shown that it can be easily transferred for use on a busy abattoir processing line. A comprehensive assessment of current industry practice was conducted, which revealed that wide range of practices are in use for the removal and handling of head meat. Information was collected on all aspects of slaughter and dressing considered to be have the potential to influence contamination of head meat with CNS material, and details of head meat harvesting procedures including: Variations in practice in these four main areas were used to construct two scenarios based on hypothetical risk of contamination (high and low) and were studied in two abattoirs with very different operating practices. In addition, the GFAP load on head meat samples after different handling and harvesting methods were studied, including storage, transport and unloading of heads to mimic best practise movement of heads from an abattoir to a cutting plant‘. The results obtained demonstrate that: The project has shown that CNS contamination of head meat does occur during normal processing of carcases at abattoirs and that the marker protein GFAP can be detected on some heads. Not using bungs in the shooting hole significantly increased the CNS contamination of head meat on the line.  Brain stem sampling does not increase the contamination of CNS material of cheek meat on heads on the kill line. For harvested cheek meat, however, brain stem sampling does increase the contamination of CNS material but the concentrations obtained were not significant when compared to the results obtained for the normal‘ processing of heads.  None of the other processes studied; storage and, transport and unloading increased the amount of CNS contamination of heads and head meat from cattle slaughtered in UK abattoirs. The project has been successful in fulfilling its aim of providing a scientific basis for an assessment of the movement of heads and the consequences for public health risk from the consumption of cheek meat harvested from heads transported, using best practice, to cutting plants.   Planned activity: None.  We were subcontractors in this project.

The opportunity was also taken to evaluate RAMAN spectroscopy.   Project Aims:   "	"Hyperspectral imaging involves scanning the cut surface of meat.  This gives a large amount of information, and forms a compositional map of the subcutaneous fat, intermuscular fat, intramuscular fat (marbling) and connective tissue.  The technology allows the different components to be separated.  This means it may be possible to develop a rapid on-line method to predict fatty acid profiles which may benefit human health. Information on fat cover and eye muscle area/lean tissue area obtained from the hyperspectral image could be used to predict carcase yield and lean meat percentage. Raman spectroscopy involves shining a laser of specific wavelength at meat and measuring the light scattered due to changes in the vibration of molecules.  Modern technological advances both in optic design and computing/software have lead to the development of both bench top and portable Raman spectrometers.  Raman spectroscopy has the advantage that, unlike near-infrared spectroscopy, it is not influenced by water content of the material and may be better suited to use on high water content foods such as meat.  This project will use the same carcases used in the evaluation of NIR hyperspectral imaging, allowing a comparison of the two techniques. Samples from the same animals were subjected to Hyperspectral imaging, RAMAN Spectroscopy and laboratory assessments of quality as well as consumer evaluation.   Results: NIR hyperspectral imaging showed that, by using an absorbance band at a specific range of wavelengths, the areas corresponding to lean and fat (marbling fat, intermuscular fat and subcutaneous fat) could be clearly identified. The distribution of fat and lean in an image of the forerib produced using spectral characteristics was almost identical to that seen in a colour image taken with a digital camera (Nikon D70). Prediction models for meat quality were developed based on the NIR characteristics of the total longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle surface, including areas of marbling fat, and also on the LD lean regions alone, excluding the marbling fat. The spectral characteristics of the marbling fat were used to predict fatty acid profiles in the muscle. Prediction models were developed by using data sets of both unbloomed and bloomed samples independently, and combined spectra of both bloomed and unbloomed samples. Prediction of Warner-Bratzler Shear Force (WBSF) using the total LD area (including marbling) was marginally better when the bloomed spectra were used (R 2 = 0.61 WBSF at 14 day aging: R 2 = 0.49 WBSF at 21 day aging) than when the unbloomed or combined spectra were used. Using the total LD spectra, prediction of eating quality attributes at 14 days aging ranged from R 2 = 0.44 for overall liking (bloomed spectra) to R 2 = 0.53 for juiciness (bloomed spectra). The coefficients of determination (R 2 ) for prediction models developed using the spectra of the LD lean (excluding marbling fat) were generally of a similar order to the models developed using the spectra of the total LD. The spectra of the total LD (including marbling) resulted in good prediction of intramuscular fat (IMF), with the best prediction model obtained using the unbloomed samples (R 2 = 0.74). Using the total LD spectra the best prediction model for total saturated fatty acids (SFA) (R 2 = 0.68) was obtained from the combined (unbloomed and bloomed) spectra model, whilst the best prediction of total monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) (R 2 = 0.80) was obtained from unbloomed samples. Prediction of total polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) using the total LD spectra was generally poorer than for SFA and MUFA.   The prediction models for most fatty acid groups such as SFA, MUFA and CLA obtained from the spectra of the marbling fat were improved by using the spectra with identified marbling fat with an area more than 50 pixels (R 2 = 0.66 SFA, R 2 = 0.58 MUFA and R2 = 0.65 CLA). However, this did not improve the R 2 value in the prediction model for PUFA (R 2 = 0.48) for which the best result was obtained from the unbloomed spectra (R 2 = 0.53). The use of identified marbling fat with an area more than 50 pixels generally eliminated the factors such as noise, misclassified pixels and also the fat adhering to the meat surface. Using Raman spectroscopy, prediction of WBSF values and consumer assessed eating quality was poor. The only statistically significant model was the prediction of juiciness, which only explained 9% of the variation in the data (R 2 = 0.09). Raman spectroscopy showed greater potential for the prediction of intramuscular fat content (R 2 = 0.23), marbling score (R 2 = 0.41), MUFA (R 2 = 0.26), SFA (R 2 = 0.25) and CLA (R 2 = 0.19). The low prediction ability of the Raman spectra to predict quality aspects may be due to the spectrometer not operating optimally. A statistically significant logistic regression model was developed which showed that consumers in the trial rated LD muscle with a WBSF value of 5.4 kg force or less as 70% acceptable.   Conclusion: NIR hyperspectral imaging offers potential for improved prediction of shear force, fatty acid composition and sensory traits of beef. Further discussions are underway with the researchers to establish the next steps in making this NIR technology suitable for online application.   "	"146"	"-1"	"Campden Bri, Agriculture Food and Biosciences Institute"

This project was linked to the EU project ProSafe Beef.  The project examined the role that forage can play in modifying the fatty acid composition and quality of beef, and the resulting effect on health indicators.   Project Aims:   "	"Grass varieties were identified that are higher in desirable fatty acids.  These were selected and grown, fed to cattle and the resulting meat analysed.  Beef from animals fed the enhanced forage (and other supplemented diets) was fed to animal models to monitor the effect on health.   Results: The extent of genetic variation in perennial ryegrass in total lipid content and the fatty acid composition of this lipid and identifying and mapping QLTs for desirable fatty acids was investigated in a ryegrass mapping population over a 3-year period and 2-cuts per season. The major fatty acid identified in grass were 16:0; 18:0; 18:1n-9; 18:2n-6 and 18:3n-3. As expected 18:3n-3 and 16:0 were the dominant fatty acids.  A significant effect of genotype and of cut, but little evidence of genotype by cut interaction was noted.  Broad sense heritabilities of concentrations of all the fatty acid constituents in the foliage of perennial ryegrass, except oleic acid were 0.5 or above. Such high heritabilities suggest that these traits can indeed be improved genetically . Significant QTLs for individual and and total fatty acids were found. The generation of a dense genetic map has also allowed to pinpoint the genomic regions underlying the traits, and the markers provide interesting leads for further analysis of these traits. Rumen studies focused on two key areas related to plants (1) fate of plant chloroplasts in the rumen and (2) role of plant secondary components in altering lipolysis and biohydrogenation.  Studies demonstrated that in animals fed on “chloroplast rich? feeds such as grass, rumen protozoa relative to bacteria are rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and that this was related to their ability to engulf chloroplasts.  A study assessed whether increasing intra-protozoal chloroplast resulted in increased throughput of PUFA to the duodenum by comparing flow of protozoa to the duodenum post feeding of a diet low in chloroplast (straw:concentrate) and high in chloroplast (fresh grass). It was found that feeding a fresh grass diet to the steers resulted in a higher protozoal chloroplast content but did not result in their increased contribution to PUFA present at the duodenum. For reasons which are currently unclear, protozoa on grass diet were retained in the rumen. Developing strategies to increase intra-protozoal chloroplast flow to the duodeum would increase flow of beneficial fatty acids to the small intestine and through to muscle . Studies confirmed that feeding red clover, compared to perennial ryegrass, containing the plant secondary component “polyphenol oxidase? (PPO) reduced lipolysis.  However, PPO-containing cocksfoot did not reduce lipolysis, suggesting limited potential for grass PPO relative to red clover PPO to alter lipid profiles in beef. The effects of plant secondary compounds (Catecholamines, Saponins, polyphenol oxidase ( Trifolium pratenses (wildtype red clover) vs. Trifolium pratenses (genetically modified PPO gene 1 silenced red clover) and tannin ( Lotus Japonicus (Low tannin) vs. Lotus pedunculatus (High tannin)) on lipolysis, biohydrogenation and the rumen microbial ecosystem were assessed in in vitro batch culture.  The studies demonstrated that (1) saponin (deodorase) was the most effective in reducing biohydrogenation and (2) that for maximum benefit of PPO in red clover it is essential that both the “substrate for the enzyme? and the enzyme are present. Two large scale beef production studies were conducted to assess the ability of plant-based strategies to produce beef with a fatty acid composition which is more consistent with current human health recommendations and consumer requirements. The first study, 40 Belgium Blue steers were fed on grass-based diets from weaning through to commencing a 120 day finishing period.  In this period cattle were fed on either grass silage or barley straw/concentrate with/without a lipid rich plant extract (referred to as PX). The amount of total lipid, neutral lipid, phospholipid, saturated fatty acids (SFA) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) in loin steaks did not vary between dietary treatments, but the amount of PUFA, n -6 and n -3 in the total lipid of meat were differentially affected by diet.  Animals receiving the forage-based diets had the lower amount of n -6 fatty acids, but higher concentrations of n -3 fatty acids (18:3n-3, EPA and DHA), compared to those fed on straw and concentrate.  Addition of PX to concentrate or forage increased the amount of n -3 fatty acids (18:3 n -3) in muscle total lipid, with subsequent improvements in the n- 6: n- 3 ratios.  This study confirmed the benefits of grass feeding relative to concentrate in improving the content of omega-3 fatty acids in beef lipids . The first, and rate-limiting, step of the conversion of 18:3 n- 3 to its long chain derivatives, EPA, DPA and DHA, is elongation to 18:4 n -3 (stearidonic acid). Provision of a diet rich in 18:4 n -3 may further enhance the incorporation of EPA, DPA and DHA in beef. The second beef study, involved 32 Charalois steers, examined the effects of feeding an oil containing stearidonic acid (18:4 n -3; source echium oil; Echium plantagineum ) relative to linolenic acid (18:3 n -3; source linseed oil).  Addition of echium oil or linseed oil had no effect on the concentrations of total lipid, neutral lipid, phospholipid, SFA, MUFA or PUFA, compared to feeding forage alone. Additionally, the ratio of n -6: n -3 fatty acids, P:S were similarly unaffected by diet, as was the concentration of EPA+DHA in the total lipid of M. longissiumus .  In both studies described above, diet had little effect on colour shelf-life or sensory properties of the beef. A series of studies were conducted to examine the effects of altering the fatty acid profile of beef lipids (beef from forage versus concentrate fed animals) on plasma lipids and lipoproteins and the development of atherosclerosis in an animal model, using the ApoE*3 Leiden mouse.  The effect of adding different oils (linseed oil, fish oil, rapeseed oil or echium oil) to the diet of the mice were also examined.  The differences in the fatty acid composition of forage versus concentrate fed beef were enough to induce some significant differences in mouse tissue fatty acids but had no overall effect on the development of atherosclerosis. Supplementing beef with relatively modest amounts of unsaturated fatty acid markedly reduced plasma cholesterol and development of atherosclerosis.  This effect was seen with all of the oils studied, but surprisingly, rapeseed oil (relatively rich in oleic and linoleic acid) was more potent than any of the n -3 PUFA rich oils studied.  While extrapolation of results in this animal model to humans should be done with caution, the results suggest that reducing the proportion of SFA in beef may be fundamentally more important that the type of fatty acid they are replaced with. In conclusion, nutritional quality is an increasingly important factor contributing to food product quality. Much attention has been placed on increasing the content of n -3 PUFA in beef and other foods as increased consumption of long chain n -3 PUFA would be beneficial in improving health and well-being and reducing disease in man.  Green forage rich in the 18:3 n -3 is an important tool to increasing delivery of n -3 PUFA through the ruminant animal into meat. As the 18:3 n -3 is the building block of the long chain n -3 PUFA (EPA and DHA) feeding forage can increase these beneficial PUFA in meat. However, the levels of n -3 PUFA, 18:3 n -3, EPA and DHA achieved by forage feeding fall below the level required to be able to claim that beef is either a “source? or “rich-in? n -3 PUFA (based on recommendations of the European Food Safety Authority).  Hence, it is essential that the two main factors influencing the levels of n -3 PUFA in beef lipids are further addressed, namely (1) strategies to enhance levels of 18:3 n -3 in forage and subsequent delivery into the animal and (2) increased ability to reduce lipolysis and/or biohydrogenation in the rumen. Progress in genetic control of lipids in perennial ryegrasses is likely to help significantly. Increased knowledge of the fate of the lipid rich chloroplast in the rumen represents a very exciting opportunity to deliver more beneficial n -3 PUFA from rumen through to the small intestine and hence to meat lipids.   Planned activity: This project has informed future research, and provided targets for plant breeders.  There are no direct messages for communication to producers.   "	"146"	"-1"	"Ibers"

The prevalence of DCB assessed in the sirloin was 12.3% based on objective measurements of pH and 8.8% based on subjective assessments.  Five per cent of carcasses showed serious dark cutting with a pH greater or equal to 6.0. There was good agreement between objective and subjective assessment methods.  Subjective assessment would be an effective way of monitoring DCB on the boning line. The main identified cause of DCB was mixing unfamiliar animals in the pre-slaughter period.  As the number of rearing pens from which animals were drafted to make up a consignment increased, so did the amount of fighting and mounting behaviour shown in the lairage, the average pH of the meat, and the %DCB based on both objective and subjective assessments.  Producers whose animals exhibited more DCB on average selected the animals in their consignments from a larger number of rearing pens. The overall level of DCB varied slightly, but not significantly, in bulls from different breeds.  Dark cutting animals tended to have a slightly lower carcass weight, probably because they grew more slowly.  There were no discernible differences in feeding system, transport time, lairage time, or the total time spent from drafting on the farm to slaughter, between animals that produced normal or dark cutting beef.  Feed and water provision immediately pre-slaughter was similar for all animals, and variation in ambient temperature was small, and there was no evidence that either of these factors affected the %DCB.   Planned activity: A briefing note on dark cutting beef has been prepared and used as the basis of practical guidance in a number of BRP and other farmer- and abattoir-facing communications.     "	"146"	"-1"	"University of Bristol"

In the NZ, it has been recommended that the proportion of chicory in lactating dairy cows‘ diets is limited to 25%, as it can cause milk taint.  In the UK, the number of lambs grazing chicory is increasing, as more and more sheep producers are using it as part of a mixed sward or a special finishing mix (chicory plus red/white clover).  Therefore, we need to ensure that grazing chicory has no detrimental effect on lamb flavour.   Project Aims:   "	"Samples will be collected from lambs that have been grazed on either grass or chicory from 4 weeks post lambing to finishing.  The samples will be analysed through the taste panel at BristolUniversity.   Results: The use of chicory as an alternative crop to finish lambs does not negatively affect lamb carcase quality.  Lambs grazing chicory grow faster, and thus finish earlier, and usually have lower levels of parasitism.  Chicory- finished lambs had consistently higher killing-out percentage compared to grass-finished lambs, with similar carcase fat scores and higher conformation scores.   Planned activity:     "	"146"	"-1"	"Sac, University of Bristol"

Evaluation of the pH/temperature relationship in beef plants in England and Wales carried out by EBLEX staff demonstrated that both hot and cold shortening is occurring in commercial beef slaughtering facilities.  It is likely that the control of the pH/temperature relationship in sheep plants has also diverged from best practice over time.

It is known that meat from older sheep is tougher than that from younger animals.  This has been clearly demonstrated in old season’s lambs compared with new season’s lambs.   Optimising post slaughter practices can markedly improve the eating quality (particularly tenderness) of old seasons lambs.  It is likely that the same practices (such as hip suspension, electrical stimulation and maturation) would benefit meat from older sheep (over 2 years of age).  This work is being undertaken in order to prepare guidelines for the sheep industry on post slaughter practises for mutton quality.   Project Aims:   "	"The practical work was conducted through the University abattoir and the following treatments were compared: Seven and fourteen days maturation were compared within main treatments.   Results: The results show that post slaughter treatments can be effective in mutton carcases but not all treatments are as effective as in younger animals.  In summary: Ageing mutton to 14 days post-slaughter produced more tender meat than that aged 7 days, but low or high voltage electrical stimulation will improve mutton tenderness over non-stimulated controls, particularly if only aged for 7 days before consumption. Aging for a further 7 days will confer extra advantage.  Hip suspension does not appear to have any benefit for mutton loin muscle tenderisation.   Planned Activity: These results will form the basis for advice on improving mutton quality for the meat industry.   "	"146"	"-1"	"University of Bristol"

While these guidelines are based on the best available evidence, they cover all foods and it is well known that the risk of C.botulinum toxin formation is not the same for all foods.  As far as can be ascertained there is no known case of C.botulinum toxicity arising from fresh vac-packed meat.  It was thought probable that a combination of factors present in raw vac-packed meat control the growth of C.botulinum and these could be defined as inherent controlling factors.   Project Aims:   "	"The project used a combination of literature review, microbiological modelling and practical research (challenge testing).   Results:  Combase predictions indicate that meats with pH values of 5.5, 5.75, 6.0 and 6.5 would have to be stored below 8, 7, 6 and 5°C respectively to prevent growth within 10 days. Only meat with a pH of 5.5 stored at 4°C was predicted not to support growth within 28days.  There is very little information in the literature on growth and toxin production by non-proteolytic C. botulinum in fresh red meat. Although the data is limited, and some is of questionable quality, what has been published shows growth can occur in fresh within 28 days at 5°C. In a challenge test, samples of raw beef, pork and lamb were inoculated with spores of a mixture of strains of non-proteolytic Clostridium botulinum types B and E. After vacuum packing, the samples were incubated at 5, 8 or 10°C and samples were taken for analysis of toxin formation after selected times of up to 63 days. A majority of the packs showed spoilage as judged by visible gas formation and off colour. Non-proteolytic C. botulinum was able to grow and produce high concentrations of toxin within 10 days at 8 or 10°C in a sterile meat based culture medium but toxin was not detected in any of the samples at 5°C. Toxin production in the raw meat samples was very sporadic but was observed in 28 days in lamb at 5°C and within 28 days in beef, pork and lamb at 8°C. At a nominal temperature of 10°C toxin was first observed after 10 days in pork and lamb and 28 days in beef. In view of the observation of toxin formation at 10 days at 10°C (the first day on which toxin was tested for), a shelf-life of more than 10 days at 8-10°C would appear to leave only a small margin of safety to allow for possible time and/or temperature abuse by consumers. Thus, these data do not support assignment of a shelf-life of more than 10 days at 8-10°C. When raw meat was stored at 5°C, toxin was detected after 28 days, but not at day 24 or earlier. A commonly used approach to food safety is that the product should be demonstrated to be safe for 150% of its shelf-life at the test (or even an abuse) temperature. The demonstration of no toxin formation within 24 days at 5°C may indicate that a shelf-life of 16 days at 5°C is justified. In conclusion, the data available on growth of non-proteolytic C. botulinum in fresh meat is limited and confused. It suggests that the probability of growth and toxin formation in refrigerated raw meat may be low but it can occur. At this time there does not appear to be sufficient scientific evidence to support a shelf-life of greater than 10 days at 8°C in fresh red meat. The position at 5°C is less clear. The challenge test work indicates that a 16 day shelf-life might be justified, while ComBase predicts an increase in viable count of 0.5 log unit at pH = 6.0, and 2.0 log unit if pH = 6.5 after 16 days at 5°C. Neither of these increases in viable count are considered acceptable. Literature data indicate growth and toxin formation in raw meat in 21-27 days at 4°C. A shelf-life of 21-28 days at 5°C does not appear to be justified.   Planned activity: The results do not support strong recommendations for changes to practice and a proactive communication plan is not considered necessary.  The possibility of further research is under consideration.   "	"146"	"-1"	"Ifr Norwich"
" 74502"	"Reducing waste in the beef and lamb supply chain (LINK) "	"http://beefandlamb.ahdb.org.uk/research/meat-eating-quality-and-safety/meat-eating-quality-and-safety-generic/reducing-meat-waste-link/"	"2009"	"2011"	"Considerable amounts of fresh beef and lamb meat are discarded before sale, and in the home, because of discolouration. WRAP (2008) estimated that 161,000 tonnes of meat and fish was wasted in the home, fourth in the list by volume, but first by value, and that there are 5.2 million tonnes of food related packaging waste. They also estimate that retailer back of store‘ waste is 1.6 million tonnes of food per annum and that each tonne of waste is equivalent to 4.5 tonnes of carbon. There are no comparable figures for in-store meat waste but this is likely to be considerable (in the order of 7000 tonnes per annum), equating to about 245,000 tonnes of carbon. There are several reasons why waste can arise, which have been addressed by this project. The key to waste reduction is better control of supply chain processes, from production to consumer, optimising key elements both for the meat itself, and associated packaging, but especially for the meat. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) calculations show that packaging has a much smaller carbon footprint than the material which it carries, particularly for red meats.   Project Aims: This project investigated different packaging technologies for fresh beef and lamb with the aim of reducing the use of plastic and CO 2 (as a packaging gas) and improving product quality. Ways to reduce oxidative spoilage during production and processing were investigated. Estimates of current meat wastage and plastics use have been evaluated.   "	"  Results: This project was divided into five objectives which sought to define some of the meat quality parameters that need to be optimised to ensure optimum shelf life of beef and lamb during retail display so that it is consumed and not wasted. It also looked at an alternative packaging system to modified atmospheres (MA), vacuum skin packing (VSP), which will potentially extend the retail display life of meat. We produced data from several experiments which illustrated how ageing meat for longer, as practiced by industry to improve tenderness and flavour, will reduce the subsequent retail display life. This was shown for both rump and sirloin cuts. The gas to meat ratio in MA packs can be reduced but the proportion of oxygen in the gas mix cannot. This would allow packers to pack meat in smaller packs provided the meat does not touch the pack lid. Within two of the objectives we showed that beef rump and lamb leg steak muscle shelf life is very much dependent upon vitamin E concentration. In winter lamb finishing systems, roots and concentrates do not supply sufficient vitamin E to give a colour shelf life sufficient to give a one week retail display and helps to explain the poorer retail life experienced by some retailers during the winter. Contrary to our hypothesis, too slow cooling which will allow the pH in some carcasses to fall below 6 before the carcass has cooled below 35ºC, and thus cause heat shortening, is not detrimental to colour shelf life. VSP can be used to extend the shelf life of meat, up to 21 days in some instances, but this is currently limited to 10d on FSA concerns over C. botulinum . An attempt to produce a more accurate assessment of the amount of beef and lamb wasted between packing and sale was only partially successful and relied upon inputs from WRAP and an Eblex sponsored piece of work by CranfieldUniversity. This area requires further study. Whilst the amount of waste seems proportionally small, at 2% of production this is a significant volume and any reduction in this waste will help the desired reduction in emissions from meat production.   Planned Activity: The University of Bristol presented three papers at BSAS, Nottingham, April 2011, on the day allocated for Industry participation. They will also present at an Eblex symposium in September 2012 and presented a paper on the results of the project at the Langford Food Industry Conference in June 2012. Data from the project will be used to support updates of EBLEX materials. This will emphasise the need to balance the benefits of meat ageing against the loss of retail colour shelf life and the benefits of VSP.     "	"146"	"-1"	"University of Bristol (Dfas)"
