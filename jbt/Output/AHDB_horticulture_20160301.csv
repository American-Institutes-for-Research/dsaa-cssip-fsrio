"FV 391a"	"Carrots: Development of artificial inoculation techniques for cavity spot caused by Pythium violae"	"http://horticulture.ahdb.org.uk//project/carrots-development-artificial-inoculation-techniques-cavity-spot-caused-pythium-violae"	"2016"	"2017"	"Summary: Cavity spot caused principally by P. violae is the major disease of carrots in the UK. Management of the disease relies on the fungicide metalaxyl-M although its efficacy is variable. The reliance on this single fungicide is of major concern to the industry as its future efficacy and sustainability is uncertain. To address this, previous AHDB Horticulture projects have evaluated potential new control measures including fungicides, biological control treatments, calcium applications and biofumigation. However, progress has been severely hampered by a lack of sufficient disease levels in many of these trials and hence new treatments have not been clearly identified. This project will test different growth media and conditions for P. violae inoculum production and define appropriate rates required for symptom development in pot and field grown carrots. The feasibility of large scale production of inoculum using solid state fermentation will also be evaluated. Aims and Objective:  (i) Project aim:  To develop artificial inoculation systems to induce cavity spot symptoms in pot and field grown carrots using P. violae.  (ii) Project objectives:  1. Develop growth media and determine conditions to optimise inoculum production of P. violae mycelium / oospores by different isolates in controlled environment  2. Test the efficacy of different rates of P. violae inoculum in producing cavity spot symptoms in pot grown carrots in the glasshouse 3. Test the efficacy of different rates P. violae inoculum in producing cavity spot symptoms in field grown carrots 4. Examine the feasibility of large scale P. violae inoculum production in solid state fermentation"	"146"	"Clarkson, John"	"-1"	"-1"	"Warwick University"
"HNS 198"	"Improving weed control in hardy nursery stock "	"http://horticulture.ahdb.org.uk//project/improving-weed-control-hardy-nursery-stock"	"2016"	"2020"	"Summary: With the loss of key herbicides available to the HNS sector, weed control has become critical. Recent projects CP86 , HNS/PO192 and 192a have identified promising new products in screening trials although some have limitations.  A programme of work is planned to build on these findings and fill gaps in control. Starting with a review of weed control practice in relevant countries, identified herbicide candidates will be assessed for activity against key weeds in container HNS with pot trials to determine control at pre-emergence and early post- emergence.  Phytotoxicity to indicative HNS species, in growth and dormant, will be screened at ADAS Boxworth.  Promising materials will be taken forward for on-nursery trials. The field-grown HNS sector is now over-dependent on few herbicides.  New products have already been identified with potential for use in field-grown herbaceous, roses and trees. Field-trials will be carried out utilising novel products with existing herbicides to develop improved programmes. Differential band-spraying developed for vegetables in SCEPTRE has potential for use in tree seed beds and will be investigated in nursery-based experiments. The HDC ornamentals weed research programme has been successful.  This proposal will continue this work, ensuring growers have the weed control techniques for the future.  Aims and Objective: Aims: To improve weed control in hardy nursery stock by means of chemical, biopesticide and cultural approaches. Objectives: 1.   To review chemical and cultural weed control techniques used in other countries on hardy nursery stock focusing on chemicals and techniques that have potential to be employed under UK conditions and regulations. 2.   To measure novel herbicides efficacy for key nursery stock weed control in pot screening experiments. 3.   To assess novel herbicides for phytotoxicity in initial screens on indicative nursery stock species, then evaluate and demonstrate on commercial nurseries the most promising novel products in phytotoxicity screening on a wider range of container grown nursery stock. 4.   To quantify the effectiveness and safety of selected novel herbicides when used in two season programmes for budded rose and tree production systems. 5.   To evaluate a range of novel herbicides for use post-planting for selected field grown herbaceous crops. 6.   To critically evaluate novel technologies for improving weed control on nurseries. 7.   To provide support for AHDB’s EAMU programme for herbicides in ornamental plant production. 8.   To deliver appropriate knowledge transfer outputs that will include updates via social media, briefing notes, growers’ walks and workshops, study tour and content for updating the Practical Weed Control for Nursery Stock guide."

Focus will be given to improving efficiency and competitiveness in small/medium scale busi- nesses, typically processing relatively small batches of a wide variety of plants, as opposed to the traditional large facilities specialised in processing large volumes of single-varieties. For this reason, the project will investigate ways of automating tasks that are usually difficult to achieve at small scale, such as taking and inserting cuttings, grading and collating plant specimens.  To achieve  this,  the project  will draw  on advances  in adaptive  robotics,  soft robot  design, and human-robot  interaction.   New technologies  such as robot programming  by demonstra- tion (whereby robots can be ‘trained’ through demonstrations of a task) will be investigated to enable horticultural workers to program soft robotic manipulators to perform repetitions of hor- ticultural tasks, while minimising risk to plant products or personnel through in-built compliance in the mechanical design. Complex motions of the hand will be recorded through a soft sensor interface (e.g., a data glove) to enable a soft, light-weight and low-cost robotic manipulator to reproduce the movement. The speed and ease with which such automation can be adapted to multiple plant varieties will be assessed with a view to maintaining quick turn-around when processing small batches of plants."

"CP 127"	"Compendium of Pest Forecasting Models"	"http://horticulture.ahdb.org.uk//project/compendium-pest-forecasting-models"	"2015"	"2015"	"Over the last 20 years, funding from Defra and AHDB Horticulture in particular has enabled the development of a variety of models for forecasting pest outbreaks, some of which have been used very successfully to target control measures.  Such models can also be used to predict the future impact of climate change on pest insects. Unfortunately, changes in funding strategies mean that these bespoke models are no longer supported in terms of software upgrades and some will become inaccessible in the longer term as operating systems change.    The aim of project CP 127 was to focus on pest insects and to develop a compendium of pest models in a format that could be used directly with inputs of current weather data, or could be transferred by commercial companies to more complex systems.  The reason for building ‘simple’ models is to make them readily accessible, more resilient to upgrades in operating systems and to ensure they can be modified over time without the need for specialist programming expertise.  Many of these are day-degree models, but others are complex (such as the Monte Carlo models for carrot fly and cabbage root fly).    The objectives of project CP 127 were to: Create the pest compendium structure using representative models. Incorporate Monte-Carlo models (cabbage root fly, carrot fly, pollen beetle, large narcissus fly) and day-degree models (lettuce-root aphid, willow-carrot aphid, currant-lettuce aphid) into the spreadsheet-based tool. Validate models using corresponding MORPH outputs i.e. using the same set of weather data to run the models in MORPH and the pest compendium.   The output from the MORPH models is available in the AHDB Horticulture Pest Bulletin on the Syngenta web site. This is updated weekly during the growing season and growers can be reminded of the bulletin through the link provided in the AHDB Horticulture weekly email, which is sent out each Friday.   The next group of models to be reformatted has now been identified and will form project CP 127a, which is in development.   Please note: AHDB Horticulture understands that pest and disease decision support tools are a guide to decision making and users should not rely just on these tools to make management decisions."

"FV 448"	"Carrot: An early warning system for risk of cavity spot in crops"	"http://horticulture.ahdb.org.uk//project/carrot-early-warning-system-risk-cavity-spot-crops"	"2015"	"2016"	"Summary: Cavity spot is a major carrot disease in the UK and is mainly caused by Pythium violae. Cavity spot reduces harvest quality. Visibly infected carrots are not acceptable for fresh produce market or processing. An early indication for cavity spot would be of great value, because it can be used as a decision support system. The test has to assess risk on cavity spot at two cost adding moments: before distribution of straw and before fields are covered. Selecting low risk fields will reduce losses and leads to less costs for labour and straw. Within this project, NSure aims to develop an early warning test to detect cavity spot at an early stage. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) will be used to identify carrot specific indicator genes that change upon an early infection with Pythium violae. The results of this project can be used in other projects regarding Pythium violae and cavity spot. Aims and Objective: (i)     Project aim(s): The aim of this project is to identify cavity spot specific indicator genes from carrot. These genes will be used to develop a practical test that quantifies the expression of those genes in order to determine the risk of cavity spot at an early stage. (ii)    Project objective(s): 1.   Collection of carrot samples (approx. 200) from different fields in two different areas (Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire) from the largest commercial variety, Nairobi. The 2nd season, a second variety will be added. Uniform quality evaluation of sampled fields. 2.   Selection of a longlist of carrot genes that may determine the risk of the development of cavity spot in variety Nairobi. 3.   Validation of carrot indicator genes in Nairobi and a second, commercial variety. 4.   Selection of a final set of carrot indicator genes that will be used for the test to determine the risk of the development of cavity spot. 5.   Development of a user friendly test format including decision criteria that will be beneficial to the growers. 6.   Continuous and active two-way communication between growers and researchers.    "	"146"	"Verhoef, Nathalie"	"-1"	"-1"	"NSure B.V."

To facilitate this, the AHDB is undertaking a project to evaluate the resilience of potato and horticulture businesses to changes in abstraction licensing in England, Scotland and Wales.  Horticultural produce and potatoes are high value crops and have significant water demands. They are reliant on access to water to ensure quality, quantity and timely supply of produce, either through supplementation by abstracted water for rain fed-crops or via complete irrigation of protected crops.  Defra and the Scottish and Welsh governments are revising the licensing system for abstracted water to comply with increasing pressures on water resources and EU environmental obligations. The volume of water available for abstraction is determined in England by the EA Catchment Abstraction Management Strategies (CAMS); in Wales by Natural Resources Wales and in Scotland by SEPA through Water Resource Management Plans. The UK government reforms are applying three measures: Resolution of unsustainable abstractions through voluntary and compulsory licence changes.  Removal of current abstraction exceptions to regulate all abstractions.  Introduction of a reformed abstraction licensing system to meet future water resource demand challenges. Aim and Objective:  To analyse and interpret the resilience of the potato and horticulture sectors to the proposed changes in water abstraction in Britain.  Objectives:  The potential impact of abstraction reform on current licences has led to a degree of uncertainty within the agricultural sector, particularly the potato and horticultural sectors which are highly dependent on abstracted water. This study will assess the complexities of the opportunities and challenges that the proposed reforms will bring. The key objectives identified are:  1. To undertake a survey of the sector levy members, ensuring that there is sufficient numerical representation to provide a detailed understanding of the current water regimes and water availability across Britain and management for the following sectors:  a. Potatoes  b. Field horticulture  c. Protected horticulture  d. Containerised plants grown outdoors.  The survey will be conducted within the first seven months of the project.  2. Identification of knowledge and infrastructure gaps. Survey questions will be tailored to gather data on sector preparations to reduce reliance on abstracted water. The answers collated will provide information on the knowledge and infrastructure gaps within the sectors and recommendations on areas to address will be provided to AHDB.  3. Survey results and conclusions will be drawn in month eight and compared with other similar recent research.  4. Develop stakeholder documents. Stakeholder documents will be produced offering clear guidance on the current abstraction licence system (relevant to each country e.g. Scotland,Wales). These will also detail proposed changes and the actions growers will have to take to ensure compliance. The documents will also provide applicable mitigation measures including water efficiency, advice based on maintenance, technological advancement and infrastructure investment. The stakeholder documents will be produced in accordance with an agreed timeframe at the inception meeting with the majority produced by month eleven, but it is suggested that one of the articles is published in month eight to correspond with the survey results. Documentation will be tailored to meet the different audiences as determined by AHDB, including growers, policy makers, and the water industry. It will be delivered ahead of project completion in month eleven."	"146"	"Ody, Kate"	"-1"	"-1"	"Ricardo Energy & Environment"
"HNS 196a"	"Identification of factors which influence infection and control of the newly emerged Peronospora causing downy mildew on aquilegia "	"http://horticulture.ahdb.org.uk//project/identification-factors-which-influence-infection-and-control-newly-emerged-peronospora"	"2015"	"2016"	"Summary: Aquilegia downy mildew is caused by a species of Peronospora which is currently unnamed. The first occurrence of the disease appears to be on a nursery in 2011, with more widespread reports in gardens during 2013. Little or no work has been published on the disease and as a result it is difficult to establish from the literature why the disease has become more prevalent. Studies will establish the conditions required for infection and sporulation, the type of spores involved and the conditions required for their survival. Strategies for disease control (cultural and chemical) will be developed. The results from the project will be disseminated through the production of best practice guidelines. Aims and Objectives:  Project aim(s): The project aims to generate data which will enable growers to combat the threat from the newly emerging downy mildew on aquilegia (ADM). The outputs from the project will generate best practice guidelines for aquilegia crops grown under protection or outdoors.   (ii) Project objective(s): 1. Determine the conditions required for infection and sporulation of the Peronospora sp. responsible for ADM. 2. Determine the survival of conidia under differing environmental conditions 3. Establish best practice methods (cultural and chemical) to prevent and control infections of ADM. 4. Dissemination of outputs from project through best practice guidelines and presentation at grower meetings Benefits to Industry:  The number of growers who have been adversely affected by ADM is unclear. However, the high level of press coverage warning of the dangers from the disease has led to concern amongst growers that a loss of sales could be similar to that seen for downy mildew on impatiens. Determining an understanding of the pathogen responsible for aquilegia downy mildew will ensure effective management strategies can be developed which would minimise future losses from the disease. Establishing an effective and economic strategy for the control of the downy mildew pathogen would reduce the risk of financial loss through loss of plants. This is particularly important while the pathogen is at an early stage of establishment in the UK.   The results will be delivered to growers through presentations at grower meetings, a final report and articles in HDC News as required.  "	"146"	"Jennings, Philip"	"-1"	"-1"	"Fera"

This studentship will adopt a multidisciplinary approach using advanced biospectroscopy sensor-based technologies previously used extensively in biomedical research applications, Attenuated Total Reflectance (ATR) and Raman spectroscopy, for the pre-symptomatic diagnosis of pest/pathogen attack in crops allowing early crop interventions thereby reducing crop losses, reducing the use of crop protection products, and reducing the incidence of chemical residues in food. Laboratory-based studies of crops grown under controlled environment conditions will identify ‘biomarkers’ that are indicative of early pre-symptomatic pest/disease attack. These studies will be used to benchmark field-based measurements made during field campaigns at UK farms using affordable portable spectroscopy equipment. The ability of these technologies to predict the impact of reduced application of crop protection products on pre- and post-harvest quality of crops, and on storage and shelf-life, will also be investigated. Field-based measurements will be used to assess the potential for biospectroscopy, and the novel biomarkers identified using this approach, for informing future strategies for protecting and increasing agricultural productivity through the targeted precision scheduling of crop protection products.   Aims and objectives:   Key milestones: 1. Exposure of the student to the full range of commercial activities underpinning the business of one of the UK’s leading producers of premium vegetable products (1-month placement with Barfoots during year 1), 2. Construction of a database of asymptomatic alterations or biomarkers associated with individual crop-pest/pathogen combinations based upon laboratory-based studies undertaken in the Lancaster Environment Centre, 3. Validation of laboratory-derived biomarkers as a diagnostic tool for pre-symptomatic pest/pathogen in the field through field campaigns at Barfoots farms using portable ATR/Raman equipment. 4. Assessment of the suitability of biospectroscopy sensor-based technologies for the targeted, and potentially automated, precision scheduling of crop protection products and for predicting the quality and shelf-life of crops.  "	"146"	"McAinsh, Martin"	"-1"	"-1"	"Lancaster University"

It will determine the environmental factors that affect behaviour and how these interact with pesticide efficacy and trapping. The project will be a novel and exciting new collaboration between the University of Southampton and East Malling Research. The student will gain skills in crop husbandry, chronophysiology, ecology, pest management, and data analyses and interpretation. D. suzukii is a currently a seriously damaging pest of soft- and stone- fruit crops. In 2014 fruit picking in some crops had to cease as the pest became too abundant in the fruits. To achieve more efficient management of this newly invasive pest it will be useful to predict the daily and seasonal fluctuations in behaviour to target strategies for more effective control. The proposed project will test daily patterns of activity, feeding and egg laying under spring, mid-summer and autumn conditions simulated in the laboratory. Further laboratory experiments will identify the contribution of light, temperature, humidity and internal timekeeping mechanisms to these observed rhythms. Parallel field trapping experiments will verify D. suzukii behaviour patterns in vulnerable crops and in wild areas where D. suzukii is known to overwinter. Once these parameters are understood the student will examine the vulnerability of the various stages to pesticide applications and how pesticides interact with field temperatures and D. suzukii behaviour, throughout the day, in their efficacy. Finally, grower recommendations regarding the likely activity and control of D. suzukii based on time of year, time of day, and weather conditions will be made.   Aims and objectives:   Project Aim:   To investigate daily and seasonal rhythms of Drosophila suzukii locomotor activity, feeding, and egg laying and formulate recommendations for field detection, trapping, and crop protection.   Objectives:   1) Determine how temperature, photoperiod, and internal time keeping mechanisms affect rhythms in D. suzukii including locomotor activity, oviposition, and feeding 2) Validate predicted D. suzukii daily and seasonal activity patterns in the field 3) Test trapping devices and approved chemical and biochemical plant protection products on the most vulnerable life stages, including optimal field temperatures for control of D. suzukii 4) Formulate recommendations for optimizing D. suzukii detection and control strategies for susceptible UK crops  "	"146"	"Wijnen, Herman"	"470"	"-1"	"University of Southampton"

The student will first extend and deploy an accurate and quantifiable automated pathogenicity test (and image analysis method) to measure differences in pathogenicity of isolates and resistance to different pathogen isolates. They will then conduct a gene expression analysis to identify similarities and differences in infection of isolates of differing virulence on susceptible and resistant hosts. Through bioinformatic comparison of isolates of N. ditissima gathered worldwide a set of candidate genes important in virulence will be established and gene disruption techniques will be used in order to determine the role of these genes in infection. This is important, as downstream application of resistance genes depends upon an accurate assessment of their durability (and hence targets). WFL and EMS, the industry contacts for this PhD are operating a new generation of breeding programme, that directly translates basic science into the applied sector and requires students with more basic skill sets to move into this industry. Furthermore, knowledge of effector targets in the pathogen could lead to novel opportunities for control by targeted disruption of the pathogen. This PhD will provide a foundation for multinational collaboration to work towards this objective. It will cement the relationship between Plant and Food NZ and UK researchers working on control of canker and further advance a global collaboration into control of this important pathogen.    Aims and Objectives: This work will provide fundamental insights into the molecular basis of pathogenicity in N. ditissima, the causative agent of apple canker.

"CP 143"	"Increasing crop yield and resource use efficiency via root-zone CO2 enrichment "	"http://horticulture.ahdb.org.uk//project/increasing-crop-yield-and-resource-use-efficiency-root-zone-co2-enrichment"	"2015"	"2018"	"Summary: CO2 enrichment of the aerial environment is widely used to increase yields of protected crops. The annual cost of CO2 production (which can be as high as £200,000 for a 5 Ha glasshouse) together with an industry-wide drive to reduce agricultural greenhouse gas emissions (to which CO2 contributes 9%) requires urgent improvements to the efficiency of resource use, the cost-effectiveness, and the environmental performance of these production systems. A specific problem of current practice is that the high humidity in the greenhouse environment requires frequent ventilation to prevent the occurrence of foliar diseases, yet this results in CO2 losses from the greenhouse to the atmosphere. This studentship will adopt a multi-scale approach to investigate the potential for using localised enrichment of the plant root-zone with low concentrations of CO2 as an alternative to bulk CO2 enrichment of the crop’s aerial environment. Small–scale pilot studies will assess the viability of different approaches for root-zone CO2 enrichment. Glasshouse studies will examine the physiological mechanisms by which plants respond to root-zone CO2 and how these responses can be optimized to maximize crop growth and economic productivity. In large-scale studies conducted in a commercial setting, current best practice in aerial CO2 enrichment will be directly compared with root-zone CO2 enrichment under comparable conditions. A full cost-benefit analysis will establish the potential of root-zone CO2 enrichment to reduce the cost and environmental impact, and improve the productivity, of protected crops. Aims and Objectives: This studentship addresses key research and development priorities of HDC’s Protected Edibles panel, which identifies four key objectives for future profit enhancing research and development in the protected edibles sector. These include: • Increasing productivity through resource efficiency. This continues to be a top priority in a sector where efficiencies are required throughout the production system (e.g. inputs of water and CO2) to keep pace with competition. • Improving environmental performance. The protected crops sector needs a dynamic approach to the challenges of emissions reduction in the face of legislative pressures to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Specifically, the government’s low carbon transition plan will affect all of agriculture and growers will need assistance from research into the development of sustainable agricultural systems to meet the requirements of the industry-led voluntary action plan. The goal to increase global agriculture production by up to 70% by 2050 appears increasing challenging in an environment where resources are becoming limited and in the face of increasing societal and legislative pressures to lessen the impacts of agriculture on the environment. CO2 enrichment of the aerial environment (typically to 1000-2000 ppm) is widely used to increase the yield of protected crops, but the costs are considerable. The annual cost for a 5 Ha glasshouse of CO2 (17,580 tonne) produced from natural gas where heat is not required is approx. £200,000 (HDC 2011; http://www.hdc.org.uk/sites/default/files/research_papers/PE%20003%20Final%202011_0.pdf). In addition, there is a drive to reduce GHG emissions from UK agriculture, of which 9% is from CO2 (Defra 2012; https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/2012-review-of-progress-in-reducing-greenhouse-gas-emissions-from-english-agriculture). This project will adopt a multi-scale approach to investigate the potential for using localised enrichment of discrete zones within the growing environment with CO2 as an alternative to large-scale CO2 enrichment of the aerial environment, thereby contributing to a reduction in both costs of CO2 and agricultural GHG emissions. As such, this studentship sits centrally within Objective 2 of the Protected Edibles Panel’s research and development priorities “Improving the cost-effectiveness and sustainability of production”, Target 1 “Increasing efficient use of resources”, Initiative C “To maximise the efficient use of all growing inputs – CO2 (production & usage)”. The plant root-zone may be ideal for the localised enrichment of the growing environment with CO2. Previous studies have highlighted the potential of this approach for increasing crop growth and productivity. Elevated rhizosphere dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) increased the biomass of hydroponically-grown tomato by up to 200% (Cramer et al 1999 JExpBot 50:79-87) whilst increasing the concentration of CO2 ([CO2]) in the root-zone to supra-optimal levels benefits plant growth and productivity. Enriching the [CO2] to 45% (45,000 ppm) in the root-zone of hydroponically-grown potato substantially increased tuberization, and increased stolon length, number of tubers per stolon, and overall dry weight (Arteca et al 1979 Science 205:1279-80). CO2 enrichment (2,000-50,000 ppm) of the root-zone of aeroponically-grown lettuce resulted in a 15-31% increase in fresh weight and a ~1.6-fold and~1.8-fold increase in shoot and root dry weight, respectively (He et al 2010 JExpBot 61:3959-3969). However, to our knowledge, the effects of enriching the root-zone to the optimal [CO2] currently used for the large-scale CO2 enrichment of the aerial environment (or to levels considered sub-optimal with respect to the aerial environment) has not been considered. Our proof-of-concept study determined whether enriching the root-zone with low (?1,500 ppm) [CO2] affected plant growth and productivity. Fig.1 (data collected within HDC Studentship PO17) shows that elevating root-zone [CO2] by ~700 ppm (relative to control values) significantly increased shoot fresh weight (~10%) of drip-irrigated semi-hydroponically-grown lettuce – plants were significantly heavier (15.6±6.6 g more) due to an increase (~7%) in dry weight. This studentship will apply localised root-zone CO2 enrichment to protected crops with the aim of improving the efficiency of resource use, the cost-effectiveness, and the environmental performance of production systems. As such, it compliments current HDC-funded research (PE021) examining the relationship between atmospheric CO2 management and crop yield and quality. The project will: • Compare the effects of DIC and root-zone CO2 enrichment on aeroponic- and hydroponic-grown plants, and direct CO2 enrichment of the root-zone of soil-grown plants, on plant growth and yield. • Determine the optimum [CO2] range for root-zone CO2 enrichment. • Determine the physiological mechanisms by which plants respond to root-zone [CO2]. • Examine how plant responses to root-zone [CO2] can be manipulated to optimize productivity gains. • Analyze the costs and benefits of root-zone CO2 enrichment relative to current best practice for CO2 enrichment of the aerial environment. Access to the commercial facilities required for larger-scale trials of root-zone CO2 enrichment will be provided through a collaboration between the Lancaster Environment Centre (LEC) and Cornerways Nursery. The project will also seek to collaborate more widely with a range of industry partners on larger-scale trials through the Tomato Growers Association (TGA) and the TGA’s technical committee. This collaboration(s) will, in addition to supporting an essential part of the study, provide important industry-focused training for the student and accelerate knowledge transfer to the industry. Studies will focus on three crops: lettuce, tomato and pepper. Experiments will be performed across three different scales: (1) small–scale studies assessing different approaches for root-zone CO2 enrichment, (2) glasshouse studies examining how plants respond to root-zone CO2 enrichment, and (3) larger-scale trials of root-zone CO2 enrichment. The latter will occur in a commercial setting to compare the costs and benefits of this approach relative to current best practice of aerial CO2 enrichment whilst (1) and (2) will occur at LEC: (1) The suitability of root-zone CO2 enrichment within aeroponic, hydroponic and drip-irrigated semi-hydroponic production systems will be assessed in small-scale experiments through enrichment of the airspace, aeration of the fertigation media with CO2, or via an increase in DIC through the addition of CaCO3 and KHCO3. In addition, the feasibility of direct CO2 enrichment of the root-zone of soil-grown plants, via injection of CO2 into the soil or using porous pipes within the soil, will also be assessed. The effects of enriching the root-zone with optimal and sub-optimal [CO2] (750-1,500 ppm), with respect to those currently used for the large-scale CO2 enrichment of the aerial environment, on plant growth and productivity will be determined through plant morphological and physiological measurements (e.g. leaf number, leaf area, relative growth rate, the fractions of biomass allocated to different plant organs). (2) The question of how plants respond to root-zone CO2, in terms of explaining the observed growth response (Fig.1) will be investigated in glasshouse experiments under conditions informed by the results from (1). Plant physiological and morphological measurements will be combined with measurements of leaf gas exchange and photosynthesis (IRGA – specifically to plot photosynthesis against leaf internal [CO2] to determine if acclimation has occurred in enriched plants), stomatal behaviour (thermal imaging and porometry) and chlorophyll content (solvent extraction and spectrophotometry). These measurement will identify any photosynthetic limitation to root-zone CO2 enrichment – the results will be compared with those of HDC project PE021 evaluating links between standard commercial CO2 enrichment and plant photosynthetic demand. The role of hydraulic and chemical signals will be determined by measuring leaf water potential (psychrometry) and whole-leaf and/or xylem sap ionic (ICP-OES) and plant hormone (radioimmunoassay/GC-MS) composition. Leaf carbon isotope discrimination will be measured as a proxy for water use efficiency. Leaf carbohydrate status will be determined via standard biochemical techniques. These studies will be used to optimize growth and productivity gains delivered through root-zone CO2 enrichment in an iterative process. (3) Larger-scale trials will initially be undertaken at Cornerways Nursery. The precise timing of these will depend on the outcomes from (1) and (2). Parallel “field-based” physiological and morphological measurements will be taken from plants subjected to root-zone CO2 enrichment and standard enrichment of the aerial environment with CO2 under comparable conditions allowing photosynthetic responses to root-zone CO2 enrichment, and the associated changes in crop productivity, to be assessed in a commercial context. Samples will be taken from both sets of plants for subsequent ionic and hormonal analysis at LEC. A detailed cost-benefit analysis of root-zone CO2 enrichment versus conventional CO2enrichment will be performed. This will take account of directly incurred expenses (CO¬2 consumption in particular) only and the benefits accrued through increases in the output-yield values of crops.  "	"146"	"Dodd, Ian"	"-1"	"-1"	""

Only a few products based on microbial biocontrol agents (BCA) have been registered in the UK to control fungal diseases, primarily Botrytis cinerea. These BCAs have been usually applied as if they were fungicides and their efficacy is often variable. Recent theoretical modelling suggested that understanding BCA population dynamics in relation to climatic conditions is critical for their deployment to control foliar pathogens. However, this aspect of biocontrol research has so far been neglected. This project aims to obtain ecological knowledge on BCAs that are currently registered and being registered in the UK and then use the knowledge to develop and evaluate strategies of applying BCAs to improve efficacy against Botrytis development on strawberry and lettuce. Specifically, we shall (1) develop molecular methods to quantify the viable population of two commercial BCAs (one fungus and one bacterium), and two new candidate BCAs (identified at EMR and are being formulated by a commercial company); (2) use the method to study BCA population dynamics under different conditions; (3) investigate BCA dispersal under different rainfall intensities in both glasshouse and field conditions; (4) use the new knowledge to optimise BCA applications and evaluate the strategies on strawberry and lettuce; (5) conduct field studies to assess whether combined use of BCAs as well as with reduced fungicide input would lead to synergy and reduced variability in biocontrol efficacy. Aims and Objectives:  Objective 1:  Developing methods for quantifying BCA population sizes (by month 12) Although quantification methods based on real-time PCR of DNA have been developed for the two BCAs, these methods are not what is required for the purposes of the present project. This project focuses on dynamics of viable BCA population (propagules); DNA-based methods cannot, however, distinguish viable propagules from non-viable propagules. RT-PCR can be used to quantify viable propagules but it will be too expensive to develop for the present project. Instead, this project will develop quantification methods based on the following approach: Cytological quantification. For B. subtilus, we shall try to genetically transform the isolates with the GFP gene to facilitate direct quantification of this BCA under the microscope. This technique has been used in many pathological studies to understand infection and subsequent invasion of pathogens inside host tissues by visualising the organisms in question. An important question is to ensure that the transformed isolate has the same or similar ecological requirements. Plating technique. For all three BCAs, plating techniques will be used to directly estimate the amount of viable colony forming units (CFU) on agar media. This approach depends on whether there are sufficient unique colony characteristics for each BCA strain to distinguish them from other resident microflora. Indirect estimation. If neither the cytological nor the plating method has worked for one or more BCA, an indirect method will be used to estimate CFU based on Botrytis severity on treated leaves. This method assumes that BCA population size is monotonically related to disease control efficacy.   Objective 2:  Determining the relationship of each BCA with external conditions (by month 24) Temperature and humidity will be studied for their effects on BCA dynamics. Experimental protocols will depend on how BCA propagule density is quantified (WP1). Experiments will be conducted initially in controlled conditions where temperature and humidity (including rainfall) are controlled and later in semi-commercial conditions (glasshouse and/or open field). These experiments are conducted to answer the following questions:   • Can we predict the dynamics of BCA propagules based on temperature and humidity under constant and fluctuating conditions? If so, this predictive model can be used in conjunction with disease models to time BCA applications. • To what extent are BCA propagules dispersed to newly emerged plant tissues? This will determine whether (and if so, at what frequency) repeated application of BCAs is necessary. Objective 3:  Determining whether combined use of BCAs leads to synergy and reduced variability in efficacy (by month 28) Initial experiments will be conducted under controlled conditions to study combined use of BCAs in relation to synergy and the variability in biocontrol efficacy. Each product will be applied either alone or in combination with another. Disease development will be assessed at several time points. Later, similar experiments will be conducted on commercial crops with multiple applications of BCAs. Results from these experiments will answer the following questions: • What combinations of BCAs can result in synergy or independent interaction? This will enable selections of BCAs to improve efficacy. • Could combined use of BCAs lead to reduced variability in biocontrol efficacy? This is important for assessing biocontrol potentials of individual products. Inconsistency in biocontrol among different studies is one factor limiting the use of BCAs. Objective 4:  Developing and evaluating strategies for BCA application (by month 36). Recently we developed a model to evaluate biocontrol with one or two BCAs under fluctuating conditions. We shall use the data obtained in WP2 to estimate BCA-related model parameters. We also attempt to incorporate fungicide effects into the model in order to evaluate the efficacy of joint use of fungicides and BCAs. Strategies will be compared theoretically using models and experimentally in large field experiments, including use of individual BCAs, combined use of BCAs at the same time, and use of alternative BCAs over time. Data from field and modelling studies will answer the following questions: • How often does combined use of BCAs outperform individual BCAs based on modelling studies using historical weather data recorded over a period of 90 years at East Malling? • Does one strategy consistently outperform another one in terms of disease suppression and variability in disease suppression? • Does the performance of a particular strategy depend on particular crops (strawberry and lettuce) or BCAs? Answers to these questions form the foundation of optimising strategies of applying BCAs in practice.  "	"146"	"Xu, Xiangming"	"-1"	"6255"	""

Degradation of prochloraz results in the production of inactive by-products, thereby reducing the efficacy of an applied dose in controlling wet and dry bubble diseases. This project aims to reduce degradation of prochloraz in the casing by reducing casing pH (which inhibits chemical breakdown) and/or stimulating a microbial population in the casing that is antagonistic to the microbes that degrade prochloraz. Casing treatments that are effective in inhibiting degradation of prochloraz will then be tested against standard casing for control of wet and dry bubble disease in pot and on-farm experiments.  Parallel tests in in vitro agar plate tests and in vivo casing experiments on the sensitivity of Verticillium and Mycogone isolates to prochloraz will be conducted. This will enable the results from rapid agar plate tests on pathogen isolates to be translated into effective Sporgon application rates on casing. Aims and Objective:  (i) Project aim(s):  1. Manipulate the casing pH and microbial population to inhibit the degradation of prochloraz to improve wet and dry bubble disease control 2. Calibrate the results of in vitro agar plate tests for prochloraz sensitivity of pathogen isolates so that they relate to levels of disease control achieved with prochloraz concentrations in casing in vivo. (ii) Project objective(s): 1. Determine the effect of the following casing factors on prochloraz degradation and control of wet and dry bubble: (a) casing pH (b) casing additives (cooked-out spent casing, bark, green waste compost) (c) bacterial inoculum (Bacillus subtilis) and supplements.  2. Calibration of in vitro plate test results for prochloraz sensitivity of Mycogone perniciosa and Lecanicillium (Verticillium) fungicola isolates against in vivo bubble disease control achieved with prochloraz concentrations in casing materials. Benefits to Industry:  • Reduced degradation of prochloraz in the casing with improved control of wet and dry bubble diseases • Enable growers to determine the required rate of Sporgon and its likely disease control efficacy in relation to the prochloraz sensitivity of the on-farm pathogens determined from agar plate tests • Minimise the use of Sporgon with reduced risk of prochloraz residues in the mushrooms and in the SMC • Determine the conditions that affect prochloraz degradation to reduce the persistence of prochloraz in SMC."

Objectives: 1. Epidemiology 1.1 Determine whether Peronospora belbahrii is present in UK seed lots and whether infected seed acts as a primary source of infection 1.2  Determine whether P. belbahrii can be detected in soil from outdoor production sites 1.3 Determine the conditions required for infection of basil by P. belbahrii 1.4 Determine survival of the different spore types under various environmental conditions 1.5 Determine the level of oospore production under protected and outdoor conditions 2. Determine the existence and importance of alternate hosts for P. belbahrii 3. Control 3.1.   Evaluate fungicide programmes in large-scale 'commercial' trials (protected and outdoor production) for efficacy against P. belbahrii. 3.2.   Evaluate the safety of fungicides & programmes for use on basil seedlings. 3.3.     Evaluate periods of illumination during the dark period to determine those which provide best suppression of infection and/or sporulation by P. belbahrii. 4. Dissemination of outputs from project through best practice guidelines, an article in HDC News  and presentation at appropriate grower meetings The production of best practice guidelines (objective 4) is dependent on results from the other objectives, however if necessary these could be produced based on the knowledge of epidemiology and control gained from other downy mildew diseases caused by Peronospora species. The remaining objectives are relatively independent of each other. In the absence of seed borne infection, determination of the existence of different strains or races of P. belbahrii (objective 1.3) would be dependent on the receipt of infected plant material from the industry."

"FV 398b"	"Carrots: Practical evaluation of field storage alternatives"	"http://horticulture.ahdb.org.uk//project/carrots-practical-evaluation-field-storage-alternatives"	"2015"	"2017"	"  Project summary: UK industry practice is to store carrots for winter / spring marketing in-situ, typically covered with a thick layer of straw (+/- polythene) to provide insulation against frost damage during the winter and to prevent warming and re-growth in the spring. However, the sustainability of field storage using straw (+/- polythene) is becoming increasingly challenged: due to the increasingly high cost and volatile supply of the large quantities of straw required; and also due to agronomic concerns such as nitrogen lock-up and weed issues. Consequently, carrot growers urgently need to examine and evaluate alternative options to current in-situ field storage practice. A previous project, (FV398a), identified inefficiencies (in terms of insulative value) in the current straw-based systems, some possible mis-conceptions, and alternative systems and materials that could have equivalent or better insulative value to the current system. However, estimates of insulative value of current and alternative systems were theoretical. This project will begin practical investigations of the current and alternative systems by (a) validation of the theoretical insulative values for alternative materials and their effect on crop quality and (b) investigate the requirements for practical implementation of alternative systems.      Project aim(s) and objective(s):   (i) Project aim(s): Practical investigation of alternatives for field-storage of carrots   (ii) Project objective(s): • To validate the theoretical calculations of insulation value of different 'systems' obtained in FV 398a • To determine the potential and practical issues associated with the most feasible alternatives identified in FV 398a • To hold a grower demonstration day     Benefits to industry: The area of carrots stored under straw is estimated at around 3-4000ha per annum. Current (2013) estimates for the costs of straw-based field storage systems are around £30 per 500 kg Hesston bale (delivered to field), applied at 80-120 bales/ha. With application and removal included, the technique costs around £4000-5000 per ha on top of crop production and harvesting costs. This is a significant and annually increasing additional cost to production which growers have to bear – and which is not sufficiently reflected in additional returns from customers for stored carrots. However, almost as important as cost is the vulnerability of straw supply – particularly with the effects of changing climate on cereal straw production, but also due to the increasing demands on the available straw supply by other agricultural or energy sectors. In addition concerns by landowners about the role of straw in the import of long-term weed problems (particularly blackgrass) affects the availability of (new) land for production. Theoretical calculations (in the previous project, FV 398a) of the insulation values indicate that a reduction in straw usage of up to 67% could be achievable by moving to a poly-over-straw system. This could amount to a saving of £2000 per ha, equivalent to at least £6 million per annum for the industry as a whole. Although the current costs of alternative materials may not lead to direct reduction in costs in the short term, there would be benefits in terms of being less reliant on a volatile supply of raw material and making additional land available where currently landowners are reluctant due to the risk of weed seed import.   Expected project outcomes • Validation of theoretical calculations for the insulation values of different field storage systems/materials in a range of environments.  • Information on the impact of different field storage systems on carrot quality at two harvest dates. • The above will enable growers to select alternative systems/materials with some confidence. • Information on the practical issues and engineering requirements that would affect the difficulty/ease of implementing alternative field-storage systems. • Field demonstration of the different systems.   Results from the project will be delivered back to growers through annual and final reports, field demonstration days, AHDB publications, dissemination at conferences and industry meetings as considered appropriate.    "	"146"	"Roberts, S."

Review and collate current knowledge of controls and biology of aphid pests affecting pepper crops Identify knowledge gaps in aphid control in pepper crops and opportunities to adopt controls used in other countries or on other crops for use in pepper crops in the UK. Benefits to Industry: Benefits to growers Growers of pepper crops will benefit from being provided with knowledge that may be incorporated into IPM programmes, together with key information on the biology of key aphid pests that may support practical implementation of controls. Potential new insecticides, biopesticides and/or biological controls may be highlighted through this project. Availability of these products may, however, require regulatory hurdles to be met (e.g. SOLA applications) or additional research specific to pepper crops. Results from this review will be presented at the Pepper Technology Group’s conference in October 2015. The project outputs will assist growers in controlling aphid pests more effectively within IPM programmes, which will help to minimise use of pesticides through effective integration with non-chemical controls. This in turn will reduce losses associated with these pests. Benefits to other levy payers Other levy payers such as researchers, consultants and suppliers of controls used against aphids in a range of crops will also benefit from the project outputs. Key aphid species affecting pepper crops include Myzus persicae (peach-potato aphid) and Aulacorthum solani (glasshouse-potato or foxglove aphid). In addition, crops may also be affected by Macrosiphum euphorbiae (potato aphid) and Aphis gossypii (melon and cotton aphid). These four aphid species are major pests attacking a wide range of both protected and outdoor grown horticultural crops. As such this review will create a model, which will inform aphid control in other sectors. Indeed, although the focus of this review is aphid control in pepper crops, the review itself will draw on best practice in a range of crops where aphids are pests. Benefits to consumers Consumers will benefit from the continued successful implementation of IPM programmes in pepper crops. This continued success will ensure that consumers continue to benefit from the availability of high quality produce; achieved with the minimal use of insecticides. Benefits to the environment Minimising the use of chemical pesticides through the use of effective IPM programmes will reduce risks to the environment."

The disease causes some losses on production nurseries but more importantly Fusarium continues to be a frequent cause of rejection by packhouses and product returns from supermarkets. Losses vary greatly between crops and seasons. We have shown several weakly pathogenic Fusarium species are associated with the disease, notably F. lactis and F. oxysporum in the UK. Fusarium spores deposited on the stigma during flowering grow rapidly through the style resulting in infection of seeds and internal fruit wall. Work in PE 007 demonstrated that a single spray of Serenade ASO applied to a crop during flowering can reduce the incidence of infection in fruit developing from treated flowers by around 50%. In PE 022 (phase 1) we showed F. lactis commonly occurs on rockwool propagation blocks in production glasshouses, a previously unknown source of the fungus. We also found that a high proportion of flowers and young fruits (1-2 cm diameter) in commercial crops were infected with F. lactis, yet only a relatively small proportion of fruit develop internal fruit rot. Results from 2014 and plans for 2015 were shared between the pathology teams at Bleiswijk Research Station (Wageningen University) and ADAS. This project aims to reduce losses to Fusarium internal fruit rot through: (1) continued information exchange and discussion on the disease with Dutch researchers; (2) examination of pepper seeds as a source of F. lactis and F. oxysporum that leads to growth of the fungi in rockwool propagation cubes; (3) determining the reduction in fruit infection provided by one and several applications of Serenade ASO to a crop row, cube surface and floor; (4) determining if use of biopesticides / plant resistance inducers applied preventatively provide protection to flowers and/or fruit against infection and/or fruit rot development; (5) monitor occurrence of F. lactis in flowers, young fruit and mature fruit in an organic pepper crop and a conventional crop; (6) communication of results to growers.   Aims and objectives: (i) Project aim: To reduce fruit wastage due to Fusarium internal rot through knowledge exchange and by targeted application of plant protection products.   (ii) Project objectives: 1. To continue liaison with the Dutch researchers working on Fusarium internal fruit rot and exchange information and results; 2. To investigate occurrence of Fusarium lactis and other Fusarium species on pepper seed, and infected seed as a possible source of Fusarium spp. on rockwool propagation cubes; 3. To determine the reduction in Fusarium internal fruit rot achieved by one or several sprays of Serenade ASO to flowers, crop and floor; 4. To examine a range of biopesticides and resistance inducers applied to flowers, leaves and roots on the level of Fusarium in flowers and young fruit; 5.

Laboratory-based resistance tests will be done on the same samples to provide a baseline for chlorantraniliprole for future reference. Identify additional products which could be usefully incorporated into the UK tomato IPM programme. Transfer knowledge to the UK tomato industry. Benefits to Industry: In 2012, Tuta absoluta was considered to be the most important pest of tomato crops in the UK. At one nursery during June-July 2012, 30% of fruit were damaged by the pest and rendered unmarketable. That represented a loss of approximately £50k per hectare to that grower for that period alone (Jacobson & Howlett, 2013). British tomato growers admit that they became complacent about Tuta absoluta over the following 3 years due to the success of the new IPM programme. However, recent control failures have made it clear that the industry must remain one step ahead of this potentially devastating pest. As a consequence, Dr Jacobson has been asked to liaise with the Insecticide Resistance Team at Rothamsted Research (IRT RR) and undertake a series of studies to strengthen the industry’s long-term management of Tuta absoluta (TGA TC Minutes, 3 June 2015). As participants in the project, the TGA TC will receive direct and continuous updates on progress and discoveries. In addition, the results will be circulated to TGA members via the Associations’ own Newsletter. Results and conclusions may also be publicised via the AHDB Horticulture Newsletter and TGA Conference (as appropriate)."	"146"	"Jacobson, Robert J"	"-1"	"-1"	"RJC Ltd"
"CP 153"	"Robot demonstration for horticulture"	"http://horticulture.ahdb.org.uk//project/robot-demonstration-horticulture"	"2015"	"2015"	"Summary Over the last 8 years a joint venture between VHS and KMS Projects has made extensive trials with different camera / vision systems on different crops. The eventual aim of this is to develop a robotic harvester. After trying the different camera systems it was eventually decided that the 3D camera system would be the best for broccoli, to measure the size of each head and if they are within the required specification.    To date a vision guidance system to control a robotic arm has been designed. The research so far has been accomplished with no grants and very limited funds. To be able to demonstrate to the horticultural industry the potential funding is sought to rent the key components, manufacture the required toolbar and fit it all on a tractor to demonstrate how a selective robot could work in a realistic practical situation.      Aims and Objective: To replace manual operations in horticulture with automated processes that can replace the hand/eye co-ordination of a human operator. Initial objective To demonstrate the integrated use of images from a 3D camera enabling a robotic arm to respond to specified crop dimensions. The vision guidance system will be demonstrated by its ability to detect the size and shape of broccoli heads and control a robot to select heads that fall within specified dimensions.   Benefits to Industry: The labour cost for manual handling of ornamentals and harvesting of edible crops is a large proportion of total costs in many horticultural businesses. Potential labour shortage or unavailability is a major risk factor for many businesses. Automation of the processes would reduce risk and cost and make businesses more competitive. The benefits go beyond the saving of labour costs. For example if processes are automated they can take place at night when temperatures are lower, thereby reducing refrigeration costs and improving shelf life and product quality. The Brassica Growers Association has identified development of an automated harvester as one of their top priorities. By inviting selected growers from all sectors of horticulture to a demonstration the potential of the technology to develop for different uses can be maximised."

"CP 136"	"Diagnostic: Development of Oomycete LFDs"	"http://horticulture.ahdb.org.uk//project/diagnostic-development-oomycete-lfds"	"2015"	"2018"	"Project summary: In years one and two of the project, oomycete disease management tools will be developed for use on-site and by crop clinics for the effective management of oomycete diseases.  Several approaches will be used:   A multiplex on-site test will provide generic probes to confirm the presence / absence of Pythium and Phytophthora in horticultural samples. If confirmed, the test will if present identify species / groupings considered pathogenic across crop sectors (Hardy Nursery stock, Protected Ornamentals, Protected Edibles and Soft Fruit). An additional test will be made available for the measurement of oomycete presence and viability for efficacy tests of disinfestation treatments such as chlorination, Pasteurisation, UV or slow sand biofiltration systems.   A crop clinic test will measure and discriminate Pythium and Phytophthora species commonly found to be pathogenic across UK-wide horticultural crop production systems. The crop clinic test will also provide information on the presence of mycoparasitic Pythium species (e.g. Pythium oligandrum, P. nunn) which may be important in biological control studies / precision application of treatments.    Sampling procedures and translation of the test result will form a priority within the project. A key driver will be for the uptake of these tests by the industry to inform cohesive disease management strategies.  It is recognised that the test formats must deliver results in an accessible way that growers can readily interpret in terms of the disease implication for the cropping system involved. A strong grower / science based interface will therefore exist within four identified HDC sectors: Hardy Nursery stock, Protected Ornamentals, Protected Edibles and Soft Fruit. This cross-sectoral industry-focussed approach will operate throughout the life of the project. Digital media (for example You Tube Clips) will provide longevity and ease of access to information on test usage and interpretation.    Throughout the life of the project comparison with current practice under field and clinic conditions will be used to evaluate and, where appropriate, validate the new tests developed.   Aims and objectives:   Project aim: To produce on-site, and laboratory tests which can be used to accurately monitor infective propagules of oomycetes in environmental samples (i.e. plants, growing media and water). The tests will operate in a multiplex format to identify oomycete presence and then specifically the pathogenic species / groups involved or propagule viability. The latter test (oomycete presence and viability) will be used in both on-site and laboratory confirmatory tests for the efficacy of disinfestation treatments, especially for water but also for growing media and circumstances where sterilants have been deployed to avoid or control disease outbreaks.   The on-site kits will provide simple, robust and inexpensive testing for early detection of oomycete fruit, root and collar rot pathogens by growers and consultants. Development of laboratory processes will enable plant clinics to provide high throughput screening of environmental samples (to include plant material). There will be capability to measure Pythium and Phytophthora to species level and to differentiate between mycoparasitic (potential biocontrol agents), non-pathogen saprobe and crop specific pathogenic species. Application of these tests will be developed for their integrated use within disease avoidance management and control systems. Commercial ‘do it yourself’ test kits would be made available at the end of the project to the UK horticulture industry. To encourage industry uptake of the technology UK-wide ‘hands-on’ workshops will be run during Years 2 and 3 of the project. Web-based visual media will be made available to assist industry understanding of the test applications, test operation and interpretation of results with respect to management of disease. Technology developed in this project will greatly enhance the capacity for accurate and rapid assessment of samples, especially water, and will be applicable to fundamental epidemiological studies and thus facilitate longer-term improvements in cultural practice.   Project objectives: A)  Develop inexpensive on site antibody-based diagnostic tests to measure in a multiplex format oomycete presence (Pythium and Phytophthora) and when present key crop-specific oomycete pathogens: Produce antibody probes with reliable genus specificity to Pythium and Phytophthora Produce monoclonal antibody probes to key plant pathogen clade groupings within the Phytophthora genus, selected for their relevance to UK-wide horticultural production, and in some instances to specific commodities, providing a panel of probes of industry-wide application. The antibodies would be raised to the following representative species:   P. cryptogea, P. cactorum, P. fragariae. Produce a similar representative panel of monoclonal antibody probes to plant pathogen clade groupings of Pythium species. These would not be limited to but include:  P. aphanidermatum, P. deliense P. debaryanum, P. sylvaticum, P. irregulare, P. intermedium, P.ultimum and P. splendens   B)  Develop an on-site test to differentiate between viable and non-viable oomycete propagules. This approach is essential for effective confirmatory efficacy tests for disinfestation treatments as a generic probe for viable oomycete propagules can test efficacy even when pathogen spores are not present because there are a large number of commonly-found oomycetes in water and growing media that should be removed by effective treatments in the same way as pathogenic species and can thus be used as indicators. Produce antibody probes with reactivity to commonly isolated waterborne oomycetes  (Pythium, Phytophthora, Saprolegnia and Aphanomyces) Identify and by recombinant protein sequence expression produce and isolate an external protein complex associated with oomycete zoospore viability. Develop a monoclonal antibody probe  to the protein complex for   test development to discriminate and measure viable  oomycete propagules (Pythium Phytophthora, Saprolegnia, Achlya and Aphanomyces species) in environmental samples   C)  Develop, using existing published molecular sequences, a MAGPIX DNA-based ELISA array. This test format would be for plant clinic use to measure and discriminate key Pythium and Phytophthora species associated with UK horticultural production. This would include the measurement of mycoparasitic species for application within biological control programmes. The test format would be transferrable to a membrane hybridization macro array.   The developed antibody probes (A) would also be evaluated for use in a simple ELISA format for use by crop clinics to differentiate between and quantify species present in a sample.   D) Provide strong cross-sectoral industry presence for uptake of the tests developed in A, B and C. Ensure that the applications, strengths and limitations of each test are well understood within the horticultural industry. This would include knowing when samples are best sent away for more detailed laboratory assessment and what might be reasonably gained from this. Develop a media support (you tube style clips, understanding the test, the application it is suited to and implication of test results) to provide technical assistance with test applications post project completion.   Benefits to industry: Reliable and affordable detection and diagnosis are key to effective oomycete disease management. With increasing globalization, travel and the international trade in plants the risk of disease spread through inadvertent introduction is exacerbated.   There is a reduction in broad spectrum fungicides which hold approval for use in the Horticulture Industry. Despite the development of the ‘off-label’ system for minor uses the number of pesticides that are currently approved for use on horticultural crops is under ever-increasing pressure. To utilise these efficiently and with optimal disease control performance there is a move away from routine pesticide application to targeted crop treatments (pesticides and biological) based on regular monitoring. This requires a greater depth of knowledge by producers and their staff to identify problems quickly. The ability to quickly diagnose many plant pathogens does not exist and simple, accurate, diagnostic tools for growers should be developed.   Pathogen detection prior to infection or the development of symptoms invariably improves the efficacy of timed control measures and can significantly reduce disease epidemics and control treatment inputs.   This project provides considerable scope for benefit in terms of early detection (i.e. ahead of symptom development and possibly even widespread infection) and targeted treatments (sanitization programmes, biological and/or chemical control). The predictive deployment of control measures will provide disease control systems that are sustainable with the use of lower-input farming systems Ultimately, financial benefit will be gained through improved quality and improved control procedures. The introduction of tests will also assist disease certification schemes.    As part of the Sustainable Use Directive (SUD) http://ec.europa.eu/food/plant/pesticides/sustainable_use_pesticides/index_en.htm from 1st January 2014 growers are required to demonstrate that they have taken alternative IPM e.g. cultural and biological, measures to prevent pest & disease development before considering and to help justify conventional spray applications of insecticides and/or fungicides. The use of predictive tests will provide a significant step forward and help minimise the need for pesticide intervention.   To provide industry understanding of the test formats and, their use for improved oomycete disease management strategies, the following approaches will be employed:   Regular visits (four times per annum) to identified nurseries/production facilities within each of four cross-sectoral areas. Cross-sectoral workshops (to include ‘Hands on’ in Year 3) would run annually and throughout the life of the project. These will provide the industry with a background to oomycete diseases an understanding of the test formats and their use for improved oomycete disease management strategies.   Web based visual media will be developed and made available to assist UK industry understanding of the test applications, test operation and interpretation of results with respect to disease management. Technology developed in this project will be applicable to other diseases and  fundamental epidemiological and disease management studies "	"146"	"Wakeham, Alison"	"-1"	"-1"	"University of Worcester"

The primary aims of this project are to: a)     Develop a Soil Management Information System (SMIS) to hold, manipulate and represent available sources of data pertaining to the specific effects of soil management practices on horticultural crop productivity and environmental protection and allow evaluation of soils in their rotational contexts. b)     Implement outputs from the SMIS such as an ‘e-Guide’ toolkit, permitting AHDB-Horticulture and its growers, agronomists and land managers access to guidance and information on evidence-based, optimal soil management practices for horticulture. The SMIS will be populated with data from current AHDB-Horticulture sponsored soil projects, from the scientific and grey literature, from ‘live’ grower generated data and also key land and environment data to which the team has unique access through LandIS and the Scottish National Soils database. The grower generated soils data will be collected from vegetable industry and other project partners but will also be proactively sought including that from fruit and some field ornamentals crops. All data will be anonymised. Industry partners are being directly consulted, in the first instance contacts have been setup up for a range of producers including leafy salads and herbs, speciality veg, red beet, Brassicas, asparagus, outdoor cucurbits, carrots & parsnips and sweetcorn. There is a strong input from the vining pea industry via PGRO who will be supplying their soil survey data collected from growers.   Objectives: I. Resource review to determine the data requirements, sources, and appropriate template/formats for data inclusion in the ‘Soil management Information System’ (SMIS). A review of existing soil information management approaches will be conducted. (mainly Year 1) II. Data collation - undertake a substantive data gathering exercise, focussing on the soil system and horticultural crop best management practices, drawing on literature, and reported case studies. A key concern is the need to preserve anonymity in the data and these will be addressed. A coherent common framework of data will be assembled for inclusion within SMIS and rationalisation will allow combination of these data with other existing national thematic datasets (e.g. soils data from Cranfield’s ‘LandIS’ and James Hutton Institute’s Scottish soils database) to produce coherent data coverage and representation, (Years 1 & 2). III.Building the Soil Management Information System with ability to hold, manipulate, validate and manage data to provide information on the benefits of soil management practices on horticultural crop productivity and environmental protection. Will also capture policy-oriented and best-practice guidelines. The computing environment will be used to hold, manipulate and manage the datasets, use analysis tools and ultimately the e-Guide and other outputs, (Years 2 & 3). IV. Development of analytical methods and statistical modelling, drawing across the body of data assembled, allowing comparative assessment and benchmarking against available grower and case-study data. This analysis will enable the provision of information as to how current soil management practices affect soil across a wide range of horticultural crops, (Years 2 & 3). V. Implement a dissemination ‘e-Guide’ toolkit, permitting stakeholders such as growers, agronomists and land managers access to guidance and information on evidence-based, optimal soil management practices and to inform future decisions on soils research and KT. This will allow consideration of the effects of different cultivation methods within different rotations identified for a set of given soil types (from SMIS or input directly by the user) and climatic zones (Year 3).  "	"146"	"Rickson, Jane"	"-1"	"-1"	"Cranfield"
"PO 021"	"Genetic and Environmental Interactions in Poinsettia Production and Shelf Life"	"http://horticulture.ahdb.org.uk//project/genetic-and-environmental-interactions-poinsettia-production-and-shelf-life"	"2015"	"2016"	"Aims and Objective: Poinsettias are a major heated poinsettia crop grown to harvest from November through to the second week of December for the Christmas market. Pot size ranges from 6 cm to 17 cm with the majority produced in a 13 cm pot. 85 % plus are sold to multiples to highly defined specifications. The variety Infinity has been the market leader for a number of years, with others filling specialist gaps in the market. There is concern over the stability of the variety and a number of alternatives are now required. Given the critical importance of variety choice, robust selection procedures are required. The objective of this trial is to establish a more rigorous process to underpin the effective selection of Poinsettia varieties: Rigorously test 10 varieties for use by UK growers. Test the varieties on 3 growers holdings and establish whether there are any genetic x grower interactions in terms of plant responses. These holdings will be across the UK, using experienced growers. Establish the impact of post harvest water management strategies (wicks, anti transpirants, water absorbent plugs) on product post harvest life. Benefits to Industry: Poinsettia are one of the most important pot plant crops between July and early December. Up to 8m Poinsettia are sold within the UK market, with c. 3.5 to 4m grown in the UK, and a market value of c. £10m to £12m p.a. at farm gate values (in pot sizes 10 to 17cm). Given that 50% of the UK crop is imported, typically from Holland, these figures suggest a significant potential for import substitution. Contrarily given the current euro exchange rate (c. 1.37euro per £), it is likely that competition from EU exports will intensify. Given the risks and opportunities for this sector, it is critically important that the industry have clear insight to develop compelling competitive advantages for UK produced crop. The benefits of these experiments are multi-faceted. It will provide UK growers with effective insight into the commercial performance of a wide range of new Poinsettia varieties benchmarked against current commercial controls. Variety choice is one of the most important decisions made in Poinsettia production, it is a critical factor in determining the commercial success of the crop. The experiments will be robust and be conducted under real commercial conditions. The experiments will also demonstrate whether varieties are robust and stable under a range of different commercial conditions. If variety performance is stable between growing sites then this may simplify the variety selection process going forward as it will provide a higher level of confidence that the selection is robust. If varieties perform very differently between sites then large numbers of selections will need to be made each year to find the best variety for a particular site and circumstance. The work on post harvest water management will also establish whether simple processes can be implemented to improve product postharvest life. Higher levels of postharvest life will help underpin a higher level of consumer confidence in the product and increased repeat sales."	"146"	"Pearson, Simon"	"1331"	"-1"	"University of Lincoln"

The proposed study will develop and evaluate different control measures to reduce woodpigeon grazing activity, and by association crop damage, to acceptable levels and provide growers with best practice advice. The project will involve a number of elements: Field evaluation of selected traditional deterrents deployed in an integrated manner based on findings from APHA (2014). Trials will evaluate the practicality, effectiveness and cost of deployment in one study area of OSR and one study area of horticultural brassicas and salad. The field trials will include evaluation of novel techniques previously shown to have potential as woodpigeon deterrents. The findings of the field trials will inform the development of improved best practice guidelines, utilising traditional and novel techniques, based on optimising resource and labour input and deterrent effect. Population control at a landscape level involving coordinated shooting over a delineated area (e.g. 10km square) during Spring/early Summer. Monitoring of woodpigeon movements and habitat use at the level of the flock to investigate changes in movement patterns and habitat use by woodpigeons in response to non-lethal and lethal control. Preliminary investigation of capturing and tagging woodpigeons in order to investigate changes in movement patterns and habitat use by individual woodpigeons in response to non-lethal and lethal control. Preliminary investigation of drones for surveying, monitoring and deterring grazing woodpigeons. Liaison with relevant stakeholders, including Horticultural Development Council (HDC), Home Grown Cereals Authority (HGCA), crop associations – Leafy Salad Growers, Brassica Growers Association, Processed Vegetable Growers Association, National Farmers Union (NFU), British Association of Shooting and Conservation (BASC).   The benefits for stakeholders will be fully realised from one further step, which is outwith the scope of this project: Facilitation of future knowledge transfer to relevant stakeholders via a range of fora such as workshops and crop association conferences.   Aims and objectives: Project aim(s): The overarching project aims are: To develop and evaluate the effectiveness of management measures to mitigate the impact of woodpigeon damage to horticultural brassicas, leafy salads, oilseed rape and legumes.   Project objective(s): To undertake field trials to evaluate the effectiveness of deterrents deployed in an integrated management strategy (IMS) on the crops of interest. The techniques and approaches to be evaluated will include those that have been identified in a previous Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) review of management options (Parrott et al. 2014: FV426). To undertake an evaluation of population management, using shooting, to reduce woodpigeon grazing activity. To undertake preliminary investigations of woodpigeon capture and tagging/marking and its potential for monitoring woodpigeon movements and habitat use in response to crop protection measures. To undertake preliminary evaluation of the potential for the application of unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) in the monitoring and management of woodpigeon grazing activity.   Benefits to industry From a successful outcome, growers could benefit from improved best-practice guidance as a consequence of: Improved yield and uniformity of maturity at harvest, currently lost due to reduced photosynthetic leaf area suffered through grazing during the early stages of growth of OSR, peas, horticultural brassicas and salads. Reduction in wastage - mature brassica and salad crops grazed by woodpigeons result in loss of marketable crop (out of specification) and costly input materials to produce the wasted crop. Reduced labour and capital costs managing deterrents more effectively. Fewer complaints from retailers and consumers concerning damaged produce. Potentially less microbial contamination of the finished product from woodpigeon faecal soiling. The results of the project will be delivered back to the growers via a range of fora such as workshops and crop association conferences (outwith the current proposal). The findings will also be written into a best practice document for circulation amongst growers (outwith the current proposal). It is anticipated that at least one publication in a scientific research journal will be produced that will facilitate dissemination to the wider scientific and industry communities."

Though considered sporadic pests of vegetable and salad crops grown outdoors, recent high incidences of capsid damage in celery suggest that the status of capsids as pests of this crop is increasing, particularly in organic crops. Three species of capsid have been seen in the vicinity of infested celery crops: common green capsid, European tarnished plant bug and what appears to be Orthops campestris, which does not have a common name.  Crop invasion by capsids is unpredictable and relatively little is known about their biology, particularly the biology of O. campestris, which would inform the development of an integrated control strategy for celery, although if the main pest species are common green capsid and European tarnished plant bug then information and techniques developed for strawberry crops might be used.   Current control of capsids in celery relies on the use of a small number of generally broad-spectrum synthetic insecticides.  In organic crops, control is reliant on the use of mesh covers, which work well if applied at the right time and well-sealed.  However, the presence of the covers may exacerbate infection by pathogens such as celery late blight, Septoria apiicola, and reduce crop quality.  The use of crop covers also presents challenges for effective weed control, is expensive and labour intensive.    The aim of this project is to improve current understanding of the complex of capsid bugs that can infest celery crops, identify the key pest species and identify and evaluate approaches to control.   Aims and objectives: Aims: The aim of this project is to: improve current understanding of the complex of capsid bugs that can infest celery crops; identify the key pest species, and identify and evaluate approaches to control.   Objectives: 1. Develop a clearer understanding of the identity and life cycles of the key species of capsid bug which infest celery crops in the UK. 2. Once the key species have been identified, determine the feasibility of rearing them in the laboratory or under semi-field conditions, so that more detailed studies can be undertaken on their life-cycle and on methods of control. 3. Using the information from Objective 1, review possible strategies (including the use of insecticides or crop covers) for managing populations of capsid bugs in the vicinity of celery crops. 4. Evaluate products currently approved for application to celery, novel insecticides and bio-insecticides that might be used on capsid bugs in small-scale field trials, and undertake a small scale study of potential biocontrol agents (predators). 5. Determine the potential and significance of improved monitoring and forecasting of infestations by capsid populations. 6. Identify promising approaches that could be investigated in a subsequent project.  "	"146"	"Collier, Rosemary"	"-1"	"-1"	"Warwick Crop Centre"

"FV 443"	"Courgettes: Review of blossom end rot - causes and potential solutions"	"http://horticulture.ahdb.org.uk//project/courgettes-review-blossom-end-rot-causes-and-potential-solutions"	"2015"	"2015"	"The Problem: Currently, a problem that has been termed ‘blossom end rot’ results in considerable yield loss in courgettes year on year. No formal work has been carried out to investigate the problem in the UK, and as a result the exact cause of this problem is undefined. Traditional blossom end-rot (BER) is categorised as a ‘physiological disorder’ which is linked to a localised calcium deficiency in the distal part of the fruit.  This could be the cause of BER in courgette, but the standard practice of flower detachment from the end of the courgette after fruit set could also introduce pathogens to the fruit through the flower scar. Growers have reported that damp, humid conditions exacerbate the problem; damp flowers can adhere to the fruit and lead to rapid break down.   Localised calcium deficiency in the fruit can also be linked to the weather (e.g. dull, humid conditions, followed by bright sunshine).  Calcium is dissolved in water and taken up passively (osmosis) by the root system. When the plant is growing rapidly under high sunlight and temperatures following a period of relative inactivity (e.g. dull conditions) the plant is less able to rapidly translocate calcium from the root in sufficient quantities to match the demand from the growing fruit tissues. It could be that a combination of the two factors are contributing to the BER losses observed in the field. Crop husbandry factors which include variety, soil structure, root health, fertiliser and pesticide applications may also play a role in the development of courgette blossom end-rot. A review of the problem and potential causes will be carried out to identify practical techniques that could be implemented to mitigate against BER. Overseas research and technical advice will be sought, as the problem is reported to be less common; these courgette crops are predominantly grown either under protection or in drier conditions compared with open field production in the UK. A final report will be delivered which will identify the plant, husbandry and environmental factors which could be involved and action identify potential solutions; the work may also identify that further research is required to identify practical solutions under UK conditions.   Aims and objectives: Project aim(s): To utilise scientific literature, technical information from both the UK and abroad and specialist grower knowledge to deliver a series of potential solutions to the problem of blossom end rot in courgettes.   Project objective(s): To define the problem of blossom end rot in courgettes and its incidence through grower liaison and review of technical literature. To carry out a literature review covering potential causes of the problem, (covering both nutrition and disease) and exploring treatment/alleviation options from the UK and overseas, which will include information from other crops. To critically evaluate potential solutions for immediate uptake by courgette growers.     Benefits to industry: The causes of the problem are identified Practical intervention could be identified for immediate uptake by the growers Reducing losses to BER would increase revenue and marketable yield Would allow information from a range of sources e.g. UK and overseas growers and from other crop types with significant BER yield losses into a single point of reference. Options would be explored from the growers perspective, ensuring suggested control options are practical and cost effective Results would be collated in a final report An article would also be written for HDC news, and a presentation given at an appropriate outdoor cucurbit event  "	"146"	"Mayne, Sarah"	"-1"	"-1"	"ADAS UK Ltd"

Compare the information from (1) against the updated risk assessment of non-native bumblebees prepared for the Great Britain Non-Native Species Secretariat (GB NSS) and identify any relevant information not used in the GB NSS assessment. Identify key gaps in knowledge relevant to the risk assessment of non-native bumblebees released in the UK.  Make findings available to the relevant sectors of the UK horticultural industry Benefits to Industry : Growers of crops that are reliant on the use of bumblebees for pollination will benefit from being provided with independent advice on the environmental risks associated with the release of non-native bumblebees (Bombus terrestris terrestris and Bombus terrestris dalmatinus). Any new information identified, gaps in knowledge, or concerns about the quality of scientific evidence could be fed into government policy making, helping to ensure that any decisions made by government regulators on the licencing of non-native bumblebees is made on the basis of the best available evidence.  The TGA estimate that withdrawal of B t terrestris and B t dalmatinus could lead to losses of 5.3% of annual UK tomato production, equating to a loss of over £4.7 m across the British tomato industry. This would result in some growers making a loss and going out of business. It is therefore of critical importance to the industry (tomato growers in particular but also other sectors dependent on bumblebees for pollination) that decisions on the licensing of non-native bumblebees for release are based on sound evidence. Consumers will benefit from the continued availability of fresh, home-grown, high quality produce. If there are real risks to the environment from releasing non-native bumblebees, then stopping this practice will result in positive outcomes for the environment."

This technique if successful, would offer an objective method to rapidly evaluate the quality of individual Swedes and minimize crop losses.     Aims and objectives: Aim: To evaluate ultrasound as an effective internal defect detection method in Swede crops Objectives: Assess different ultrasound devices and frequency ranges to verify the technique is a viable method of Brown Heart detection defects in Swede Select appropriate sampling and testing criteria suitable for defect detection based on findings of point 1 Quantify precision and accuracy of methods used for Swede defect detection Quantify statistically, correct positive detection rates of Brown Heart Swede samples Critically evaluate if method presents a viable commercial scale detection system   Benefits to the industry: The aim of the research is to provide a fast, economical, non-destructive method of internal defect determination within swedes. This could lay the foundations for later development of a production line system to identify failing individual roots on a conveyor belt and eject them. Crop losses would be substantially reduced offering the obvious financial benefits to growers and provide quality assurance to retailers.

To evaluate optimum rates of chlormequat (Stabilan 750) & trinexapac ethyl (Cutaway) on key field grown HNS species To quantify the effectiveness of tank mixing (Stabilan 750) & trinexapac ethyl (Cutaway) for their effect on growth of two field grown deciduous transplanted species (Alnus & Betula).  To investigate the use and optimum timing of plant growth regulators on transplants and one cutting raised subject to prevent excessive growth.  To identify any negative effects of the use of these plant growth regulators. To produce an article for HDC news which summarises and promotes the results of the experimental work. To organise a nursery based open afternoon to allow growers to view the results at the end of the growing season, prior to lifting. This could be part of a wider technology transfer day for producers of field grown stock as provisionally discussed with Wayne Brough (if required by HDC/the industry) Benefits to Industry: Field grown stock is graded by height, so excessive growth can result in stock exceeding height specifications. This can result in extra cost where stock has to be cut back, reductions in profitability, or increased wastage where cutting back is not a feasible option (particularly where stock is destined to be sold as a tree).  Increased control of crop growth and more uniform crop height is thought to reduce grading costs by 5%. Improved growth control should reduce the percentage of stock exceeding 90cm (the maximum transplant height required by the forestry sector); resulting in increased marketability of the crop. As growers within the tree and hedging sector have their own sprayers or use contractors to apply plant protection products, the application of plant growth regulators would not require additional capital investment."

To improve soil health, fertility and function however, we need clear methods and criteria to allow simple, quick assessment and measurement.  With this project we will review and compare current approaches and develop and field test a set of methods, approaches, and tools for soil assessment and management.   Most growers understand the importance of soil, but do not keep up to date with the research and latest best practice. With this project we will inspire and empower growers to improve their soil by translating these methods, approaches and tools, as well as the existing and developing soils research, into clear, practical information and training resources for growers which will complement the subject-specific HDC factsheet series.   The project partners combine a wealth of experience in soil based research, knowledge exchange and communication that will enable them to effectively deliver the aims of the project.   Aims and objectives: Aims: The overall aim of this project is to inspire and support fruit and vegetable growers (primarily) to develop the ability and confidence to assess the health of their soils and take practical action to improve their soil management strategies.   Equipped with an improved understanding of soil health, they will be able to choose appropriate m ethods to enhance and maintain the health of their soils; which is key to good crop health, yield and quality.   The project will: ·evaluate soil assessment methods for growers ·improve growers’ confidence in ‘reading the signs’ ·offer the opportunity to practise assessment methods with colleagues and advisors ·engage with, and disseminate the methods and approaches to a wide range of levy payers, growers, advisors and other stakeholders ·develop methods and approaches for practical soil analysis and evaluation to enable confident choice of management options.     Objectives:   1  Review. This work package will produce a comprehensive synopsis of existing soil health assessment methods and strategies, based on a recently completed literature review1  and other recent papers, reviews and techniques developed by research organisations or commercial companies.   (Year 1) Led by Organic Research Centre.   2    Develop an integrated approach to soil health assessment and improvement.   2.1 Grower consultations (held as workshops). Together with practitioners we will critically review and evaluate existing methods and approaches for assessing, benchmarking and improving soil health in a whole farm/system approach. We will do this in close collaboration with growers and advisors to determine the usefulness, efficiency and applicability of the methods and approaches during a series of four workshops across the UK.   2.2 Field testing of the approaches identified in 2.1. The soil assessment methods identified in 2.1 will be field tested during two growing seasons, 2016 and 2017. The field tests will be conducted on six farms across the UK, taking various soil types, growing regions and growing systems into account. This will identify usability, relevance and acceptance of the identified methods, but also serve as training and dissemination opportunities for field lab events.   2.3 Using all information gained from the grower workshops and field trials, we will develop and agree common methods and approaches for improved and comprehensive soil health measurement, as well as a range of strategies to maintain and enhance soil health in UK horticultural systems. (Year 1) Led by Organic Research Centre   3  Development of KE strategy and materials.   The project team will develop an agreed KE strategy and materials to disseminate information on best practice in measuring and managing soil health in soil-grown horticulture following consultation with HDC and levy payers. We plan to use existing, proven KE tools and will consult widely with HDC, growers, agronomists and other KE professionals on this, alongside using novel approaches and methods. The exact approach will be developed following consultation, as the project progresses, but at present, we propose to:   3.1 develop outline plan for a UK-wide KE Programme, to include blend of KE methods (years 1 and 2)   3.2 produce six case studies on effective soil health measurement and strategies for improvement (years 1 and 2)   3.3 produce six guidance notes on costs and benefits of improving soil health at farm level (years 1 and 2)   3.4 develop online hub on soil health measurement and management for HDC levy payers.

From the review those techniques that provide practical and useful methods will be assessed on a number of crops to validate their practical use for growers on a nursery. In the final part of the work a range of nursery crops, at various nursery locations in both the UK and Europe, will be assessed and monitored using the techniques to validate their usefulness, and to give Nurserymen an initial set of tests to start developing on-nursery monitoring schemes. Recommendations for further work beyond year three will be included.   Aims and objectives: Aims: To provide growers with a clear insight into the types of monitoring techniques which can be used on nurseries, how these may compare to laboratory results and to achieve a 'blueprint' for good nursery practice in the understanding of fertilisation and monitoring of nutritional status of crops. Objectives: 1. Review the information which is already available surrounding the 'aims' above. 2. Make recommendations from '1' above on scheme for practically monitoring nursery crops 3. Test the recommended protocols on example crops at a number of geographically different locations 4. Select and validate the techniques on specific nursery sites and across a wider number of geographical locations and with a wider range of plant subjects.   Benefits to the industry:   The levy payer For a considerable period of time HONS nurseries have struggled to really make use of and/or benchmark their crop performance, with laboratory or on nursery nutritional indictor tests. Whilst various monitoring schemes have been available they have not been particularly nursery friendly and have often been undertaken remotely from actual staff on nurseries. The aim of this work is to demystify the techniques available and through on-nursery demonstrations of the use of techniques allow nurseries to adopt best practice in the monitoring and development of their crops. This may well involve some ‘quick’ on nursery tests supported by laboratory measurement.  It is expected that the project will enable nurserymen to reduce nutrient input costs as they match applications to crop requirements.    The consumer For the consumer this should lead to even higher quality standards for the produce with enhanced shelf life. Environmentally it is anticipated that there will be a better understanding of leaching of fertilizer risks and how to reduce and or eliminate such losses and to better match fertilizer inputs to crop requirements.   The environment With the Belgian site already meeting the requirements of the Water Framework Directive the project will bring to the UK nurseryman valuable experience gained over several years on nutrient levels and applications to  HONS subjects that result in reduced nutrient discharges."

This project will evaluate the current and future potential of precision farming techniques to improve soil and nutrient management in horticulture. Phase One will include: • A soil structure survey to assess soil structural condition under horticulture cropping systems and to establish a baseline of current soil management practices. • A review of available precision farming techniques and their potential application to horticulture. The review will engage with industry, including the precision farming companies and machine manufacturers, growers, consultants and researchers to evaluate the potential for precision farming techniques such as controlled traffic farming, soil mapping, remote sensing of crop canopies, variable rate inputs and yield mapping, to increase crop marketable yield and profitability. In Phase Two (years 2 & 3) the techniques with the greatest potential for uptake will be demonstrated and evaluated in field experiments on six commercial farms. The project will draw on the expertise of a steering group of growers, researchers and independent consultants to inform the project and provide guidance on the selection of sites/techniques for field experimental work. A targeted knowledge transfer programme including six field trial open days and associated literature will facilitate rapid and widespread uptake of precision techniques within horticulture.   Aims and objectives: Aim: The overall aim of this project is to evaluate the current and future potential of precision farming techniques to optimise soil and nutrient management for improved profitability and sustainable intensification of horticulture crop production systems.   Objectives: Phase One: Field survey of soil structural condition in horticulture and review of precision farming techniques for improved soil and nutrient management (first 14 months) Objective 1. To assess the structural condition of horticultural soils and establish baseline information on typical soil management practices across a range of horticultural crops (perennial, biennial and annual). Objective 2. To review the current commercially available precision farming techniques used for soil and nutrient management and to assess their potential application in horticulture cropping systems. Objective 3. Collate the outputs from the soil structure survey (Objective 1) and review (Objective 2) into a practical user friendly ‘Guide to improved soil and nutrient management in horticulture’.

"FV 440"	"Lettuce and baby leaf salads: Investigation into control measures for Silver Y moth and caterpillars"	"http://horticulture.ahdb.org.uk//project/lettuce-and-baby-leaf-salads-investigation-control-measures-silver-y-moth-and-caterpillars"	"2015"	"2017"	"The Problem: Damage caused by the Silver Y moth and other caterpillar species can result in unacceptable leaf damage in outdoor baby leaf and lettuce crops, where there is zero tolerance for either the presence of, or visible damage from, these pests.  Loss of active ingredients has left the industry with a limited list of insecticides which are not effective and all have long harvest intervals. This is resulting in poor control of these pests in UK crops. The overall aim of the project is to provide growers of lettuce and baby leaf salad crops with the tools (decision-support and control methods) to improve overall control of silver Y moth and other pest caterpillars.  A relatively large and diverse project consortium has been assembled.  This will maximise the opportunity for collecting meaningful information that is of direct relevance to growers.  The consortium includes research organisations, consultants, growers and members of the wider industry (e.g. provision of monitoring systems).  The focus will be on novel control agents (insecticides and bioinsecticides), some of which have been identified in the SCEPTRE project, and on the use of monitoring approaches to improve the identification of potential problems and aid decision-making with regard to treatment.  The project will also evaluate the performance and utility of a novel system for monitoring pest moths using pheromone traps.  The project team will investigate other monitoring and control mechanisms which may be effective and the consortium will make recommendations for how they might be developed through future research, as additional detailed investigation is likely to be outside the scope of this project.  Whilst most pesticide efficacy trials will be undertaken on research sites, the majority of pest and crop monitoring will be undertaken on commercial holdings.  If there are opportunities to undertake small evaluation trials on commercial holdings, these will be taken.  All project participants and other interested parties will be invited to a ‘brainstorming’ workshop at the start of the project and this will also include a short demonstration on the novel pheromone trapping system.  The output from the project will be presented at at least one industry meeting.  In addition to the annual and final reports, the consortium will produce at least one article for HDC News and a factsheet on an improved strategy for control of silver Y moth and other caterpillars.   Aims and objectives: Aims:  The overall aim of the project is to provide growers of lettuce and baby leaf salad crops with the tools (decision-support and control methods) to improve overall control of silver Y moth caterpillars and other pest caterpillars.    Objectives: 1. Liaise with agrochemical companies and crop protection specialists to identify experimental conventional pesticides which may show efficacy in controlling caterpillars. 2. Consider the use of novel, approved or near market, biological control products which might be beneficial in reducing the risk of pesticide residues.  3. Gather accurate and detailed data during the project by undertaking thorough assessments which will be statistically robust. 4. Carry out suitable, randomised and replicated, field trials in both baby leaf and lettuce crops to measure the efficacy of the chosen treatment regimes. 5. Develop a risk-based spray-decision-making system linked to trapping of moths and measure its efficacy, via field trials, against normal pest control practice. 6. Investigate other monitoring and control mechanisms which may be effective and make recommendations for how they might be developed through future research. 7. Engage and communicate with growers and other members of the industry.   Benefits to industry: The proposal has been submitted in response to a call by the HDC to carry out studies to investigate potential mechanisms for the control of Silver Y moth (Autographa gamma) in Baby Leaf crops and other caterpillar species in outdoor lettuce. The benefits of a successful outcome to the project will be improved quality of crops marketed and fewer crop losses and rejections.  The aim is to deliver the results back to the growers by engaging them fully in the project from the beginning.  In addition, the wider industry will be informed through the annual and final reports, articles in HDC news, a factsheet and at least one open industry meeting.  Whilst the project will focus on pests of baby leaf and salad crops, it will have implications for caterpillar control on other crop types, both with regard to control methods and the approaches used to monitor the pest species and make decisions about control.  "	"146"	"Collier, Rosemary"	"-1"	"-1"	"Warwick Crop Centre"

The results of the proposed project will be disseminated to growers via several HDC channels including the project report, an article in HDC News, a talk at a grower meeting and updated information associated with the carrot fly and willow-carrot aphid forecasts published on the Syngenta website at present.   Aims and objectives:   Project aim(s): The aim of this project is to evaluate a range of strategies for deploying approved products for aphid and carrot fly control to optimise timing and thereby efficacy and to determine how novel actives might be incorporated into programmes in future.   Project objective(s): Objective 1      Evaluate insecticide treatment programmes applied to control willow-carrot aphid, their impact on virus transmission and their role in control of first generation carrot fly.  Determine whether using PCR tests to estimate virus incidence is a good way of evaluating the impact of certain insecticides/treatment programmes on virus transmission.   Objective 2      Evaluate insecticide treatment programmes to control second, and potentially, third generation carrot fly.   Benefits to industry: In the British Carrot Growers Association Research and Development Strategy (2012 – 2015) aphids and carrot fly are targets for R & D.  Both can result in significant loss of quality and thereby yield. Aphid transmitted virus is a top priority.   The results of the proposed project will be disseminated to growers via several HDC channels including the project report, an article in HDC News, a talk at a grower meeting and updated information associated with the carrot fly and willow-carrot aphid forecasts published on the Syngenta website at present."

Reducing losses through improved crop protection of common pests and diseases could potentially increase the value of the industry by £4.5 to £13.5 million.  With the threat of losing key pesticides under the ongoing review under EC directive 1107/2009 and endocrine disruptor definition, integrated approaches will become increasingly important.  However, the occurrence of spotted wing drosophila (SWD) calls the future of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) and non pesticidal approaches into question particularly as cane fruit are some of the most susceptible crops to SWD damage.  The development of approaches which can enable the continued decrease in reliance on pesticides in spite of SWD, and other yet to be identified new pests or diseases, is critical in order to maintain minimal residues and sustainable management of pests and diseases. Aims and Objectives: To advance and optimise on-farm integrated management of key pests and diseases of cane fruit. In years one and two the specific objectives and aligned tasks are: Objective 1:  To investigate the infection process of Phytophthora rubi to inform the use of alternative or supplementary means to the use of chemical plant protection products for reducing the level of root rot in raspberries. Task 1.1: To elucidate whether more-susceptible varieties cause greater attraction of P. rubi zoospores than more-resistant varieties; Task 1.2: To determine if selected elicitors and nutrients have a detrimental effect on P. rubi infection; Task 1.3: To determine if or how selected fungal and bacterial supplements or microbial plant protection products have a detrimental effect on P. rubi infection; Task 1.4: To determine whether chemical and biological products used in a programme can have a more detrimental effect on P. rubi zoospore attraction or plant infestation than multiple applications of a single product; Objective 2:  To develop and maintain IPM approaches to successfully control two spotted spider mite whilst controlling spotted winged drosophila (SWD) and capsids with insecticides. Task 2.1: To investigate consequences of SWD control strategies on two spotted spider mite populations on a commercial holding already dealing with the pest; Task 2.2: To develop compatibility strategies for biocontrol of two spotted spider mite by predatory mites with insecticide sprays for SWD and capsids; Objective 3:  To develop and combine novel and current IPM approaches to successfully control blackberry leaf midge; Objective 4:  To investigate strains of Verticillium spp. and thresholds for infection in cane fruit crops Objective 5:  To disseminate research results to growers and translate research outputs into practical ‘ready to use’ techniques for immediate uptake on farms.

In particular the potential withdrawal of products which are classified as endocrine disruptors such as Systhane (myclobutanil) and the reduction in permitted applications per season of new actives available to the industry. Aims and Objectives:  Develop and implement Integrated Pest Management (IPM)-compatible strategies for the control of key tree fruit diseases and pests with an emphasis on minimising pesticide use in light of future pesticide withdrawals achieved through: (i) utilising off-season control; (ii) optimising treatment application; (iii) integrating cultural controls, biocontrol agents and non-pesticide alternatives; (iv) cultivating and enhancing natural enemies; (v) incorporating novel technologies (e.g. pheromone mating disruption); (vi) considering established and newly planted orchards. Objectives: 1. Continue surveillance of current and invasive pests and diseases 2. Develop an IPM strategy for canker control from nursery propagation to established orchards 3. Reduce reliance on fungicides for control of apple foliar diseases through promotion of plant health/resistance and off-season control 4.

In a previous Hort LINK project (Developing biocontrol methods and their integration in sustainable pest and disease management in blackcurrant production: HL01105), four potential components of the female sex pheromone of blackcurrant sawfly were identified and synthesised.  Field tests suggested that three of these compounds were necessary for attraction of males.  High catches of males were obtained in some fields and very low in others, confirming the sporadic nature of the pest.   This project will aim to optimise the pheromone blend, dispenser and trap and then to calibrate catches in the traps with field populations of blackcurrant sawfly.  Factors affecting this relationship, such as the presence of predators and use of pesticides, will be investigated and thresholds for the two generations estimated.  The trap will be made commercially available with a protocol for its use by growers.   Project aim: The aim of the project is to develop a pheromone-baited trap for blackcurrant sawfly that can be used by growers to monitor populations so they can improve the timeliness and effectiveness of control measures and minimise insecticide residues in the crop.   Project objectives: • Optimise pheromone blend, dispenser and trap for blackcurrant sawfly • Calibrate catches in the pheromone trap with field populations of blackcurrant sawfly in two generations (over 2 years) and determine factors (pesticides and natural predation) affecting this relationship • Make trap commercially available with protocol for its use by growers including suggested thresholds for the two generations   Benefits to industry: Blackcurrant sawfly is a common and frequently damaging pest of blackcurrant, present to varying degrees in all UK blackcurrant plantations.  Larvae feed on foliage causing defoliation which weakens the bushes and causes substantial losses in yield.  Larvae may also contaminate harvested fruit so good control prior to harvest is important.  Infestation is sporadic and localised and damage can occur rapidly. Frequent crop inspection is needed for first signs of eggs, larvae and damage.  Current grower practice is application of a spray of insecticide as soon as eggs, larvae or damage is detected by crop scouting and it is believed there is widespread unnecessary treatment leading to risk of residues in the crop. Chlorpyrifos and thiacloprid are both very effective against sawfly but their future may be uncertain. Consumers’ desire for minimal, if not zero, residues of organophosphate materials is likely to limit or curtail the use of chlorpyrifos in the future. Adequate crop scouting is time-consuming and expensive, and a more sensitive and rapid monitoring method is needed.  More effective monitoring would help to make more cost-effective use of insecticides currently available with a likely reduction in their use.  Monitoring will be vital for effective use of any more benign, biological approaches developed in the future. Pheromone traps could provide such a tool.  Growers are generally familiar with this technology providing it is made readily available through commercial suppliers with adequate supporting information and protocols.    "	"146"	"Fountain, Michelle"	"-1"	"-1"	"East Malling Research"

There are no other independent facilities for vining pea evaluation in the UK.  Trials are only undertaken one site at The PGRO trial ground.  The soil type at Thornhaugh represents a small area of the national pea growing production and varieties can often perform differently in other soil types and areas. An extension of the PGRO trials system to include an evaluation of the candidate (Main Trial) commercial varieties at both Thornhaugh (or similar) and in South Lincolnshire sites will add to refine the evaluation process, with additional information to supplement data from established trials. Aims and Objectives: (i) Project aim(s): Provide information for the grower on new vining pea varieties when grown on a light silt soil type. (ii) Project objective(s): 1. Yield relative to a standard at TR100 and TR120 2. Maturity relative to a standard at TR100 and TR120 3. Size-grade specification 4. Haulm length 5. Standing ability at harvest 6.

"HNS/PO 192a"	"Herbicides screening for ornamental plant production (nursery stock, cut flowers and wallflowers)"	"http://horticulture.ahdb.org.uk//project/herbicides-screening-ornamental-plant-production-nursery-stock-cut-flowers-and-wallflowers-0"	"2015"	"2016"	"The Problem: This project will build on results from HNS PO 192 to refine and demonstrate promising treatments for important cut-flower crops and wallflowers and to add two additional crops to the programme.  Season long programmes will be developed for container nursery stock using a combination of new (HDC H22 and HDC H25) and currently authorised herbicides. Additional areas of work will be to compare treatments for liverwort control for efficacy and longevity compared with Mosskade and to test new herbicides (including HDC H22 and HDC H24) for crop safety on field grown hawthorn when used on the dormant crop.   Aims and objectives: Project aim(s):  To develop new herbicide options for ornamental plant growers in order to achieve effective, economic weed control with minimal crop damage.   Project objective(s): 1) To test 9 new herbicide treatments, alone or in combinations, for crop safety on 4 drilled flower species (sweet william, china aster, larkspur, wallflower) and 1 perennial flower species (peony). 2) To demonstrate 3 promising herbicide treatments in larger demonstration plots on growers’ holdings for sweet williams and transplanted china aster. 3) To test 6 herbicide programmes for crop safety on 40 container-grown hardy nursery stock shrub subjects when used as post-potting, late summer and winter applications to provide season long weed control. 4) To test 15 treatments (including herbicides, biocides, physical acting and commodity substances) for liverwort control, for contact and residual action when applied either in Summer or Winter. 5) To test 7 herbicide treatments for crop safety on field grown 2/0 hawthorn seedlings as dormant season treatments. 6) To communicate the results of the project to growers and the wider industry.   Benefits to industry: For cut flower growers successful completion of the project would produce a number of benefits for the industry: Labour savings, as hand-weeding would be reduced; Risk of crop damage minimised; Better cost-effectiveness and pesticide audit, and environmental benefits, as unnecessary or ineffective herbicide applications would be avoided;   The UK outdoor flower crop area is ca. 800 ha. With herbicides costing from about £100 per ha and an application cost of about £20 per ha, one herbicide application across the area would cost the industry around £96k per annum. With improved knowledge, either the cost of ineffective treatments would be saved, or treatments that were effective would result in labour saving (reduced hand weeding) and a better quality crop.   For container nursery stock growers hand weeding is costly, estimated as being up to 30-40 times more expensive than herbicide programmes.  With labour accounting for around 40% of container production costs, hand weeding alone can account for 10% of this cost.  Hand weeding, as well as being costly, inevitably leaves some seed behind as a source of contamination for the next stage of production.   Virtually all container nursery stock growers could benefit from this work as weed control is a common problem across the industry.  Willowherb groundsel are particular problems and the loss of Ronstar 2G and restrictions on the use of Butisan S will make control more difficult to achieve.  In order for growers to take up this work authorisations would be required for HDC H22 and H25. Work is already underway to achieve a label recommendation for ornamentals for HDC H25.  Work is also underway to achieve registration in the UK for HDC H22, once that is obtained an EAMU can be applied for.    The control of liverwort is a longstanding problem in pots, beds and paths for the container nursery stock industry.  The recent introduction of the physical acting control Mosskade has eased the situation but growers have found it is less effective during the summer and relatively short lasting.  It is also an expensive treatment to use on a large scale including paths and beds.  Therefore further treatments are sought that could complement the use of Mosskade offering more persistent and economical control although they may not be applicable in all fields of use.   There are a number of treatments that could provide liverwort control in different situations of use. It would be extremely valuable for the industry for all these products to be critically assessed alongside each other and ranked for pre-emergence, contact and persistence of liverwort control.  From this recommendations could be drawn up for different situations of use (eg beds, paths or over crops, protected and unprotected)   The loss of Ronstar Liquid will impact on growers of field grown nursery stock, so the development of further safe herbicide treatments will be useful to maintain control and avoid resort to expensive hand weeding.            "	"146"	"Atwood, John"	"-1"	"-1"	"ADAS UK Ltd"
"FV 416b"	"Brassicas: Treatments to control cabbage root fly"	"http://horticulture.ahdb.org.uk//project/brassicas-treatments-control-cabbage-root-fly"	"2015"	"2016"	"Project summary: Recent HDC projects (FV 416 and 416a) and complementary research in SCEPTRE have focused mainly on control of cabbage root fly in transplanted brassica crops and the main method of application has been through pre-planting module drenches.  This research has centred on potential alternatives to Dursban WG for cabbage root fly control in the short and longer term.  In terms of the Approved alternative, Tracer, this has shown that Tracer-treated plants can be held on nurseries and with exposure to heavy watering for at least 2 weeks without significant reduction in performance compared with Dursban WG and that Tracer applied pre-planting is as effective as Dursban WG in control of damage in the root zone, but that Tracer is less effective than Dursban WG at controlling damage in the lower stem zone (between the module and the soil surface).  In 2014, there was also a small study in FV 416a on application efficiency in commercial nurseries and this raised some interesting questions about both the amount of insecticide applied to individual modules during the treatment process and also the sampling approach that should be used to assess this.  Finally, the SCEPTRE project has identified a number of new products with potential to control cabbage root fly.    In the last few weeks it has become apparent that there have been problems in Cornwall in relation to damage to overwintering cauliflower crops by third generation cabbage root fly.  This has identified a need to re-assess control of cabbage root fly by means other than pre-planting module drenches as these do not seem to provide sufficient protection against damage to the lower stem area when modules are planted deep.   In addition there are a number of problems associated with the use of fine mesh netting to exclude cabbage root fly from swede crops, particularly associated with pest damage occurring under the netting.  Some work to determine when cabbage root fly eggs and larvae cease to be a threat to swede crops at the end of the season, in relation to the timing of removal of crop covers, is still ongoing in FV 416a, but further assessment of the problems associated with crop covers and evaluation of potential solutions is required.   The aim of the proposed project is to improve control of cabbage root fly in leafy brassica and swede crops.  Specific objectives are to: 1) assess the application efficiency of module drench treatments in commercial nurseries; 2) determine the utility of egg-sampling for determining the risk of damage to overwintered cauliflower plants in Cornwall by third generation cabbage root fly and identify appropriate methods of cabbage root fly control and 3) identify and summarise the key problems associated with use of crop covers to control cabbage root fly on swede crops and  determine whether changes in practice would improve control without compromising yield and quality.   The results will be delivered through the Final Report, an article in HDC News, the HDC Brassica Newsletter and a presentation at an industry meeting.  There may also be useful information that can be used in conjunction with the HDC cabbage root fly forecast, currently available on the Syngenta web site.   Aims and objectives: Project aim: The aim of the project is to improve control of cabbage root fly in leafy brassica and swede crops.   Project objective: Objective 1 Assess the application efficiency of module drench treatments in commercial nurseries.  Objective 2 Determine the utility of egg-sampling for determining the risk of damage to overwintered cauliflower plants in Cornwall by third generation cabbage root fly and identify appropriate methods of cabbage root fly control. Objective 3 Identify and summarise the key problems associated with use of crop covers to control cabbage root fly on swede crops.  Determine whether changes in practice would improve control without compromising yield and quality.    Benefits to industry: Cabbage root fly is a serious pest of brassica crops and most crops are exposed to egg-laying by cabbage root fly females.  Recently, particular concerns have been raised about control of cabbage root fly in swede crops using fine mesh netting and in overwintered cauliflower crops, the latter being due to high pressure from third generation cabbage root fly.    The results will be delivered through the Final Report, an article in HDC News, the HDC Brassica Newsletter and a presentation at an industry meeting.  There may also be useful information that can be used in conjunction with the HDC cabbage root fly forecast, currently available on the Syngenta web site. "	"146"	"Collier, Rosemary"	"-1"	"-1"	"Warwick Crop Centre"

J A Collison and Sons have already commissioned  an experimental deep pool system (measuring 4m x 8m) which they are prepared to make available to the wider industry providing HDC funds are available for adequate revenue funding towards managing the project in 2015.  It is proposed to use this facility to investigate the basic production requirements for deep pool systems. This project is grower driven and will be managed by a management group comprised of J A Collison and Sons, Lambs Flowers and Whiteheads of Boston.  They will determine the direction of the project and will be responsible for ensuring that HDC levy payers obtain the maximum benefits from the project in year one. KT activities will include articles in the trade press and HDC News, an open day  incorporated with the 2015 CFC open day and a stand alone event probably in late September or mid September, informal ""grower walk"" type events, snippets on the CFC blog and a final formal HDC report. The overall benefits to the industry will be a cost effective assessment of a cut flower deep pool hydroponics system which will provide sound baseline data to determine the future direction of any additional trials work.  The actual costings of a commercial system will be considered as part of the project but too much detail may not be possible in year 1.   Aims and objectives: Project aim: The aim of the project is to assess the potential of deep pool hydroponics for the production of cut flowers.  This will be achieved by the development of a proactive grower based and grower led trial.   Project objectives: 1.    To determine which commercial cut flower crops can be grown in a deep pool hydroponics system. 2.      To determine the most appropriate tray design for the production of cut flower crops including size of propagation module and nature of air gap between the tray and the water. 3.    To determine the most appropriate ""recipe"" for the cut flowers grown. 4.    To determine the need for crop supports and if required, to suggest possible solutions. 5.    To us the information of the year 1 trials to determine the future direction of any additional work required and possibly look at drawing in other funding eg Agritech.   It is important to appreciate that this trial will determine baseline information for the production in deep pool hydroponics and as such the objectives above could change if other issues become apparent during the year.  All of the objectives are linked and each one  could have implications for the others."

"SF 161"	"Rhubarb: Evaluation of herbicides for problem weeds - 2015"	"http://horticulture.ahdb.org.uk//project/rhubarb-evaluation-herbicides-problem-weeds-2015"	"2015"	"2015"	"Project Summary: Efficient and cost effective weed control is important in rhubarb as with other crops to prevent yield loss as a result of competition for water and nutrients and to enable efficient harvesting without impedance by weed growth. Rhubarb production is increasing year on year, with marketed yields rising by 1000 tonnes a year, every year for the last three years. Multiples therefore have an increasing interest in this crop with a potential 10 month season. In recent years, rhubarb crown size and yield is decreasing in both forced and green pull crops, and growers believe that this is as a consequence of increased competition from weeds amongst other influencing factors. Therefore, effective weed management in rhubarb is set to become more important to allow supply to keep up with this increased demand. In addition, the strict requirements of retailers’ quality protocols for clean produce free of dirt and contamination mean that cultivations carried out for weed control can occasionally lead to unintentional mud splash. Further effective herbicides may reduce the frequency of these operations and aid the grower in avoiding such issues. The majority of rhubarb herbicide programmes are currently based on pendimethalin propyzamide and clomazone, and these do not provide complete enough weed spectrum efficacy and persistence (See appendix for detail on weeds controlled by current herbicides). Work carried out in HDC project SF 129 gave useful information for growers on the efficacy and crop safety of clomazone which gained an EAMU while the experiment was being carried out and increased the weed spectrum controlled, but there are still gaps to fill. Mesotrione and metribuzin tested in the same project also showed useful activity, with the latter showing some control of Himalayan balsam and therefore it would be useful to revisit these products as well as test some newer materials with a view to gaining EAMUs. This would be particularly timely with the introduction of the Sustainable Use Directive and the recent change in the EU to the assessment of plant protection products by hazard in addition to risk based criteria which has placed some residual herbicides under threat. The recent Endocrine Disruptor review and the review of implications for the industry carried out by HDC, highlights the future status and availability of pendimethalin and propyzamide is therefore at best uncertain. Consultation with rhubarb growers in Yorkshire, the Midlands, East Anglia and the South has confirmed support for work to identify alternative herbicides from amongst currently available products - or those likely to become so - which provide a good spectrum of weed control, with a high priority for ‘problem weeds’ such as Himalayan balsam (Impatiens glandulifera) and perennials e.g. docks and thistles, and potential replacements for products being lost. A literature search has shown there is virtually no specific information available to rhubarb growers on the control of Himalayan balsam. Although there is an EAMU for glyphosate, the short dormant season of the crop gives few windows for treatment and since the loss of dichlobenil, perennial weed infestations are on the increase. Growers should benefit from this work by having a wider choice of herbicides in order to maintain effective weed control in plantations, which would otherwise be difficult as a result of increasing restrictions on or loss of current herbicides. The project will also add useful information on weed control of the more unusual weeds that may trouble growers, as these are seldom listed on product labels and agrochemical company websites. Furthermore, information gained on weed species controlled may give guidance in other perennial sectors such as asparagus, and field grown ornamentals.   Aims and objectives: Aims: The aim of this project is to evaluate a selection of newer herbicides for crop safety and efficacy against a range of problem weeds in rhubarb plantations, compared with industry standards.   Objectives: • To identify and evaluate the weed control efficacy of a number of new residual herbicides against crop standard treatments • To evaluate the weed control efficacy of a range of contact herbicide treatments for perennial weed control • To evaluate the crop safety of both the contact and residual herbicides applied by assessing phytotoxicity • Publicise the results to the industry through an HDC news article and a presentation at an appropriate grower event.   Benefits to industry: Growers will receive specific information on the herbicides best suited to controlling commonly encountered and problem annual weeds and perennial weeds in rhubarb. Information and data obtained will allow a comparison of efficacy and cost of new treatments with existing approved materials. This will enable growers to adjust programmes in the light of changing herbicide availability and crop requirements, using newer products when these become available through the EAMU programme.  "	"146"	"Creed, Chris"	"-1"	"-1"	"ADAS UK Ltd"

These modifications, whether they manipulate light spectra, light quantity or transmission pattern (diffusion) can have profound and interesting advantages in terms of commercial application. This project seeks to review current and emerging technology used to change light transmission properties of modern glazing patterns. A second phase and project, following the recommendations, may be required to test the materials under experimental conditions.   Project aims and objectives: Aims:  To assess the impact of optical coatings and new glass technology for use in protected horticulture.   Objectives: The objectives are to investigate the potential of optical coatings for the protected crop industry. These coatings can be considered in numerous forms, including polymer based coatings to glass, changes in glass structural properties to effect an optical change or spray on chemicals to glass (e.g. chalk or other diffusers / reflective materials). The work will be split into two phases, first a desk top review of current technology which will be captured in a detailed report with a succinct grower summary highlighting key information and opportunities for levy payers. This will provide indications of product technical capability and potential applications. The second phase (in a subsequent proposal) will address the questions raised via experimental approaches, and possibly the development of engineering solutions. The second phase will likely involve large scale experimentation and this application relates to funding for the first phase of work involving review and scoping.   A. Review the commercial impact of state of the art and new materials by potential crop response mechanism focusing on applications relevant to current or future UK commercial crop production and including assimilation of the information into outcomes (immediate or via further development) for levy payers, if key questions are not fully answered in the review then knowledge gaps will be stated and identified;   1)         Optically diffuse materials (diffuse glass, polyethylene and spray on materials to glass). a) Assess the yield gain from optical diffusion b) Understand the optimum diffusing pattern (isotropic / non-isotropic) c) Understand the impact on plant growth and stress, especially canopy transpiration patterns.   2)         Solar reflecting materials (e.g. reflective polymer coatings, polyethylene,  spray on coats such as chalk) a) Understand the benefit from reduced plant stress b) Understand the potential for improved temperature control and possible yield impact c) Understand impact of reduced solar gain on greenhouse energy consumption d) Understand the expected increase in achieved carbon dioxide levels resulting from reduced ventilation attributed to solar control film and its potential impact on yield.   3)         UV absorbing and transmitting materials a) Understand impact on pesticide degradation, and possible reduced chemical dosages. b) Identify which specific pests and diseases of relevance to UK production are controlled by UV blocking and assess likely commercial relevance. c) Assess potential photosynthetic gain from reduced UV photo inhibition. d) Assess side effects, including impact on bee vision and crop flavour, explore mitigating options.   4)         Far-red reflecting materials a) Understand the potential impact on plant morphology from far red reflecting materials. b) Understand the lessons learnt from the use of FR absorbing polyethylene films (Solartrol)     B. Review the commercially available films and recently patented materials   5)         a)         Conduct a review of current and potential new commercially available materials and outline their properties as published by the manufacturers. These include 3M, Saint Gobain, Eastman, AGC Glass, Pilkington, BPI plc, XL Horticulture Ltd, and manufacturers of spray on coatings. Visit the manufacturer as appropriate to understand current marketed product and forthcoming technologies. Establish current uptake of their technologies (e.g. diffude glass or polyethylene, spray on coats). Visit a number of growers who are the early uptakers of these technologies, for example, growers who have installed diffuse glass / polyethylene, gain feedback from real experiences. b)         Conduct a literature search (including patents) on the manufacturers active in this field, extend the search to include manufacturers of coatings for automotive glass and solar control glass used for heat reduction in building. Most of the ongoing coating development is likely to be conducted for the later two applications. This aspect of the work will be conducted solely for the purpose of horizon scanning. Horticulture frequently applies and exploits materials developed in other sectors of industry. c)         Irrespective of coatings, understand the technical performance of new glass manufacturing technology (UV opaque and transparent, multiple reflective materials, low iron content glass, tempered glass etc, performance etc)   6)         Potential application mapping. Map the potential benefits of the products currently on the market to horticultural applications. Indicate potential installation costs (if available) and any limitations (warrants, dirt contamination on surfaces, ability to clean glass etc).   Benefits to industry: The benefits to the industry could be profound: it could produce a significant step forward in the yield potential of all protected crops.   For example, for high wire crops in advanced glass structures, guideline installation costs during a new build of c. £30 m2 may be realistic. The Tomato Growers Association estimate that 1m2 of tomato production creates an income of £55m2. If we estimate that 1m2 of tomato production creates an income of £5.50m2 per year, this would equate to a 6 year payback. We believe the 10% is conservative and would expect the benefit of diffusion per se to approach this level. This generates a positive payback, without quantifyingother benefits in terms of fruit quality, improved environment etc.   There are likely wide scale benefits to the producers of ornamentals crops from diffuse glass, potential post-hearvest and yield benefits for the producers of soft fruits. Impacts of produce colour, flavour and appearance may be significant across a range of sectors.   The project will also provide longer term benefits in developing an improved scientific basis for the design of new materials.    "	"146"	"Pearson, Simon"	"-1"	"-1"	"Freiston Associates Ltd"

Probably the biggest structural change in recent years is the rapid increase in the production of protected soft fruit under polytunnels. The structures used by growers are either temporary or semi-permanent and as such they are not normally identified on Ordnance Survey maps (although polytunnels may sometimes occupy the sites of historic glasshouses). By using satellite remote sensing the characteristic features of polytunnels can be detected and discriminated from other buildings or cover. Novel digital classification techniques will identify the polytunnels to produce a digital map layer that can be used by HDC to cross-reference against farm ownership datasets.   Aims and objectives: (i) Project aim(s):   To develop a methodology to enable HDC to identify and locate polytunnels for the purposes of developing and maintaining a strategic overview of a rapidly expanding industry sector and to assist with levy enforcement   (ii) Project objective(s):   1. Identify the different types of polytunnel available in the UK to understand the physical characteristics for discrimination from other similar features such as glasshouses, fleece, and other temporary buildings. 2. Identify, test and evaluate remote sensing technologies and image processing techniques for identifying polytunnels.

"FV 423a"	"Onion neck rot: seed infection, pathogens and treatments"	"http://horticulture.ahdb.org.uk//project/onion-neck-rot-seed-infection-pathogens-and-treatments"	"2015"	"2015"	"Project summary: Neck rot can cause significant losses in stored onions. It is caused by three species of Botrytis: B. aclada, B. allii, B. bysoidea. B. bysoidea is thought to be less important; B. allii and aclada were previously lumped together as one species (B. allii). The disease is seed-borne but symptoms are not apparent in the field and only develop in store. It is likely that most seed is tested by seed companies, and is treated with fungicides. Nevertheless major losses still occur in some years. The absence of field symptoms means the link between seed-borne infection and storage losses is obscure; it is further affected by weather conditions and inoculum load, therefore there remains some controversy about the importance of seed infection. This project will provide an independent assessment of the prevalence and incidence of the disease in commercially available onion seed in the UK. We will also provide some insight into the relative importance of the two main species that cause it, both in seed in store, and examine the ability of seed treatment fungicides to control the disease. Finally we will also begin studies to determine if it matters which pathogen(s) is/are present on seed.   Aims and objectives:   Aims: To provide UK growers with additional information on the incidence and prevalence of seed-borne Botrytis neck rot pathogens and options for their control. Objectives: 1. Determine the prevalence and incidence of Botrytis neck rot pathogens on commercially available onion seed. 2. Obtain isolates of Botrytis neck rot pathogens from stored bulbs. 3. Identify isolated neck rot Botrytis spp. to species level. 4. Determine the fungicide sensitivity of selected isolates in vitro. 5. Determine the efficacy of fungicide seed treatments on apparent seed infection and seed transmission. 6. Determine if there is a difference in seed-to-seedling transmission between the the two Botrytis allii/aclada species. 7. Prepare a final report.  "	"146"	"Roberts, Steven J"	"-1"	"-1"	""
"CP 138"	"Transition to responsibly sourced growing media use within UK Horticulture"	"http://horticulture.ahdb.org.uk//project/transition-responsibly-sourced-growing-media-use-within-uk-horticulture"	"2015"	"2019"	"Project summary: This project will provide a mechanism for the UK Horticulture industry to ease the transition from a dependence on peat to the acceptance and uptake of a broad range of proprietary responsibly sourced growing media.  The project will provide a science based quantitative tool for growing media formulation which will increase the confidence of commercial growers in and promote the transition to responsibly sourced growing media.  This project advocates a move away from iterative stand alone ‘look-see’ trials towards an innovative predictive ‘unifying multivariate model’ which will target desirable blends at least financial cost.  To validate the model, large-scale on site grower demonstration and R&D trials will be utilised for data gathering; importantly the experimental work and the application of the model will be used to promote the benefits to the industry of developing, cost effective and optimal performing raw material combinations.  The project will enable an exciting and structured flow of knowledge between the strategic and applied research communities and the industry.  Whilst the project is 5 years in duration, the lasting legacy of the work will be a process of progressive innovative refinement of responsibly sourced growing media blends, over a 20 year timeframe and beyond.   Aims and objectives: Aims: To construct a model that will produce the desired mixes at least cost. To evaluate responsibly sourced growing media blends as alternatives to peat in commercial crop production systems. By on site demonstration and effective communication of the scientific evidence base increase grower confidence to facilitate the uptake of responsibly sourced growing media for commercial horticulture.   Objectives: Determine the specific needs of each horticultural sector in terms of growing media requirements and match these against suitable raw materials and blends using appropriate methodology Identify and address, where practicable, any issues which may impact now and in the short to medium-term, on the suitability of the media in terms of availability, consistency, price, practical use on nurseries / farms and direct impact on production.  Examine the impact of the medium used throughout the whole supply chain (both retail and amenity) including, but not limited to shelf-life and establishment after planting. Formulate a programme of work via engagement with growers, growing media manufacturers (GMM) and retailers to demonstrate the attributes of the media and to determine how they are best managed commercially. Communicate any outcomes and conclusions to industry in a clear and concise way throughout the project via nursery / farm demonstrations, technical events, suitable publications, electronic media and other events as appropriate.   "	"146"	"Mulholland, Barry"	"-1"	"-1"	"ADAS UK Ltd"
"CP 118"	"Cucurbit pollination: mechanisms and management to optimise field crop quality and quantity"	"http://horticulture.ahdb.org.uk//project/cucurbit-pollination-mechanisms-and-management-optimise-field-crop-quality-and-quantity"	"2015"	"2017"	"The Problem: Most cucurbit crops require insect pollination to set fruit, and their production in the UK has been steadily increasing over recent years, due to demand from supermarkets and their increasing popularity as part of a healthy diet. Although not grown over large areas, they are high value crops and the quality of each ‘fruit’ is important to market value. They are also a traditional and popular choice for allotments and gardens and part of the recent trend to “grow your own”. To ensure productive and sustainable yields, it is important to understand whether the dynamics of pollination are affecting yield quality of quantity in the UK. This project focuses on the pollination dynamics of field-grown courgettes (Cucurbita pepo) as a model species for cucurbit crops, in collaboration with a local grower P.E.Simmons & Son (Cornwall). It will investigate the effectiveness and abundance of pollinators in the UK, to determine whether pollination is limiting crop quality or quantity and if so, under what conditions. In its native range Cucurbita pepo is pollinated by specialised squash bees (Peponapis species) which do not occur in the UK, so this studentship will question how effective our native insects are at pollinating the crops. Ways of improving pollination within field systems will then be explored, for example by considering the introduction of honeybee or bumblebee colonies; or by introducing wild flower strips into the fields to provide extra forage for the bees (which could have a positive or negative effect on courgette flower visitation).   Aims and objectives: Objectives These are listed as a series of questions that the student will answer (in year 2 and 3, choices between the options will be made depending on results to date, advice from industry and resources available). Year 1: 1. What are the most effective wild pollinators of field-grown courgettes in South West UK in terms of abundance, visitation rate and pollen transfer efficiency? 2. Does pollination deficit limit yield (number, quality of fruits)? If so, under what environmental conditions? Year 2: 3. Does the introduction of honeybee colonies (or commercial bumblebees) improve pollination and consequent yield? 4. Does the introduction of a flower strip between rows or along a field edge alter the effectiveness of pollination? If pollinators are supported with other floral resources do they visit the courgette flowers more (attraction) or less (distraction)? Year 3: 5. Is there an interaction between water use (or nitrogen use) and pollination levels? 6. How do the findings on pollination in field-grown courgettes compare with courgettes grown in allotments and gardens (which might have larger bee populations – Osborne et al, J Appl Ecol 2008)?    "	"146"	"Osborne, Juliet"	"905"	"-1"	"University of Exeter"
"PE 020a"	"Tomato: Further optimisation of Macrolophus release and feeding strategies"	"http://horticulture.ahdb.org.uk//project/tomato-further-optimisation-macrolophus-release-and-feeding-strategies"	"2015"	"2015"	"Project summary: • Macrolophus pygmaeus adults and nymphs are voracious predators and will feed on whiteflies, Liriomyza leafminers, spider mites and Tuta absoluta. They have the potential to become one of the most useful biological control agents available to tomato growers. However, at £70 - £80 per 1,000, M. pygmaeus is also one of the most expensive, so the predator must always be used as efficiently as possible. • HDC project PC 302d demonstrated that when M. pygmaeus does establish efficiently it can form the basis of a highly effective IPM control programme for Tuta absoluta. However, establishment and population growth have been inconsistent. • HDC project PE 020 demonstrated that early season population growth was improved when the predator was provided with supplementary food in the form of Artemia eggs. However, the study also raised questions about the type and condition of that food as well as natural mortality of the purchased M. pygmaeus. • The results were presented to the Tomato Growers’ Association Technical Committee who requested the continuation of studies during the 2015 growing season (Minutes of TGA TC meeting on 5 September 2014). The TGA TC has since confirmed their support of this Full Proposal for HDC funding (Dr Morley, TGA TC, Pers. Com. 27 September 2014). • In laboratory-based experiments, the team will compare the suitability of three types of supplementary food with each type tested in dehydrated (i.e. as supplied) and fully hydrated condition. • If as suspected, the food must be in the fully hydrated state, then a suitable delivery system will be developed for use in tomato crops. • The most effective type / condition / delivery system of food will then be taken forward to a crop-scale trial. The speed of M. pygmaeus population growth will be measured from four combinations of release rate and feeding strategies. The trials work will be done in commercial crops following the general experimental approach that was successfully developed in HDC project PC 240 and more recently used in HDC projects PC 251, PC 295, PC 302/b/d and PE 020. Experimental design and analysis of data will be done under the guidance of a senior statistician with considerable experience of completing trials under the constraints imposed by commercial crop production. • WSG has assembled a team of appropriately qualified and experienced personnel to undertake this project. The team have an excellent record of delivering practical solutions and effectively conveying new information to the tomato industry. • Based on the losses reported within this proposal, the project could provide payback in less than one year.   Aims and objectives: (i) Project aim: To improve the reliability and efficacy of Macrolophus pygmaeus as a biological control agent on UK tomato crops. (ii) Project objective(s): 1. To evaluate a range of supplementary foods 2. To develop a feeding point that will keep the food material in a hydrated state 3. To evaluate a range of M. pygmaeus release and feeding strategies in a crop-scale trial. 4. Draft a Factsheet for UK growers describing in detail the new strategy 5. Convey results to tomato industry  "	"146"	"Howlett, P"	"-1"	"-1"	"Vitacress"
