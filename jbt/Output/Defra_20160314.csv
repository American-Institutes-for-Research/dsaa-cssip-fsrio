"OD0221"	"EMIDA - Development of immune function and avian gut health"	"http://randd.defra.gov.uk//Default.aspx?Menu=Menu&Module=More&Location=None&Completed=2&ProjectID=18232#Description"	"2012"	"2016"	"The DIFAGH proposal links cutting edge technologies with gut flora modification experiments to define the contribution of microbial colonisation to the development of chicken immune capacity, resistance and transmission of infection. The programme unites efforts of experienced avian immunologists, pathogen specialists and gut flora microbiologists, forming a trans-EU team of scientists to address the complex interactions between the chicken and its microbial environment. The proposed programme of work will deliver a combination of high quality fundamental research and practical outcomes, defining a new framework for selecting pro-biotic formulations to accelerate immune development, improve poultry gut health and reduce pathogen carriage. Specifically, we will determine the effects of pro-biotic formulations of differing complexity on the development of immune capability and the outcome of infection. We will also determine the effects on colonisation, persistence and transmission of Campylobacter and Salmonella. The studies will employ pro-biotic formulations under a variety of conditions to define how these interactions affect pathogen dynamics. We will determine the effects of microflora on development of the chicken intestinal immune system and the reciprocal impact of immunity on the microflora. Similarly, we will define the interactions between natural gut microflora, pro-biotic formulations, housing, chicken strain and infection dynamics. Each of these areas will involve application of established and new methods to determine changes in the immune system, the gut flora and disease transmission dynamics. These analyses will be supported by in vitro approaches to determine the microbial recognition events within the bird (such as those mediated by the avian Pattern Recognition Receptor system). One important anticipated outcome of this work will be to develop a new set of selection criteria for identifying components of defined pro-biotic formulations that can be used to promote the health of poultry and reduce the impact of infections that are pathogenic to poultry or transmitted from poultry to humans. We also expect to discover new pro-biotic components, formulations and delivery criteria that will maximise the impact of these sustainable interventions. Delivery of these outcomes is supported by the within programme links to industry and by employing the experienced technology transfer teams at each institution. In addition to the scientific and practical solutions for the industry the DIFAGH programme will also be a focus for recruitment and training of future generations of researchers in this field."

We will achieve this through the combined used of the project partners expertise. The resulting lateral flow device will be used for simple, rapid diagnosis of fasciolosis at the pen-side and will provide evidence of the life-stage of F. hepatica, this is of paramount importance as it influences the choice and efficacy of drug treatments. In diagnosing the parasite and the most efficacious treatment option the novel test will provide a clear economic benefit to the livestock producer. The test will also allow compliance with government policy on the best practice for F. hepatica treatment being on an individual animal basis. In doing so overall drug use will be reduced again reducing costs to the farmer and contributing to the reduction of anthelmintic-resistance."

"OZ0157"	"COMPARE (COllaborative Management Platform for detection and Analyses of (Re-) emerging and foodborne outbreaks in Europe)"	"http://randd.defra.gov.uk//Default.aspx?Menu=Menu&Module=More&Location=None&Completed=2&ProjectID=19676#Description"	"2013"	"2016"	"1.1 OBJECTIVES COMPARE (COllaborative Management Platform for detection and Analyses of (Re-) emerging and foodborne outbreaks in Europe) is a collaboration of founding members of the Global Microbial Identifier (GMI) initiative (http://www.globalmicrobialidentifier.org) and institutions with hands-on experience in outbreak detection and response. GMI was established in 2011 with the vision to develop the potential of breakthrough sequencing technologies for the field of infectious diseases through a joint research and development agenda, with applications in clinical and public health laboratories across the world. In order to achieve that long-term goal, the GMI group aims to promote development and deployment of novel applications, data sharing and analysis systems across the diversity of pathogens, domains and sectors. The COMPARE project is set up to put this vision into action in Europe, addressing the following main objective: • TO IMPROVE RAPID IDENTIFICATION, CONTAINMENT AND MITIGATION OF EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND FOODBORNE OUTBREAKS, • BY DEVELOPING A CROSS-SECTOR AND CROSS-PATHOGEN ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK AND GLOBALLY LINKED DATA AND INFORMATION SHARING PLATFORM, • THAT INTEGRATES STATE-OF-THE-ART STRATEGIES, TOOLS, TECHNOLOGIES AND METHODS FOR COLLECTING, PROCESSING AND ANALYZING SEQUENCE-BASED PATHOGEN DATA IN COMBINATION WITH ASSOCIATED (CLINICAL, EPIDEMIOLOGICAL AND OTHER) DATA, • FOR THE GENERATION OF ACTIONABLE INFORMATION TO RELEVANT AUTHORITIES AND OTHER USERS IN THE HUMAN HEALTH, ANIMAL HEALTH AND FOOD SAFETY DOMAINS; Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) used for Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) or Whole Community Sequencing (WCS or metagenomics) are opening and dominating a new field of data generation and connection, revolutionizing pathogen detection and typing in human and animal health just as much as in food science. These technologies are rapidly dropping in cost and starting to become in reach of routine clinical and public health laboratories (Köser et al. 2012, Didelot et al. 2012). NGS/WGS/WCS enables generating the complete genomic information from the isolate or sample independent of both the sector (public health, veterinary health, food safety), and the type of pathogen (viruses, bacteria, parasites). The outputs (sequence data) provide one common language that can be exchanged and compared between laboratories and over time, in combination with other associated data defined here as “metadata” including contextual data (e.g. data on sample type and process, clinical, microbiological, epidemiological and other data) primary data (raw sequence reads) and derived data (e.g., genomic alignments of reads, assemblies and functional annotation data sets). COMPARE aims to harness the rapid advances in these technologies to improve identification, and mitigation of emerging infectious diseases and foodborne outbreaks. To this purpose COMPARE will establish a “One serves all” analytical framework and data exchange platform that will allow real time analysis and interpretation of sequence-based pathogen data in combination with associated data. Figure 1: Genomic Information as the pathogen independent language across locations, sectors and time COMPARE 3 In order to achieve this, COMPARE will pursue specific objectives A through G, to be realized within the fiveyear duration of COMPARE. Together these 7 project objectives shape the overall structure of COMPARE – as depicted in figure 2 – showing the different components of the COMPARE Analytical Framework. The project follows a common trajectory necessary to obtain high quality information for stakeholders to improve rapid identification, containment and mitigation of emerging infectious diseases and foodborne outbreaks. A. Starting from the design of risk-assessment models and risk-based sampling and data collection strategies that enhance our capacity to detect potential disease outbreaks; B. From samples and associated metadata to comparable data: The process to obtain high quality and comparable sequence data from and metadata associated with a specimen; C. From comparable data to actionable information: The downstream analyses involved in turning comparable data into actionable information for addressing questions in frontline diagnostics, food-borne infections and (re-) emerging infections. “Actionable Information” is defined as information that enables users generating/receiving this information to take well-informed decisions and actions in pursuit of: • Pathogen identification and characterization: Pathogen identification, genotyping and phenotyping, (e.g., detection of relevant antimicrobial resistance, virulence, epidemiological markers); • Outbreak detection: Detection of putative clusters by examining strain-specific clusters in time, place and host (person, animal and food); • Outbreak investigation: Rapid interrogation for given molecular strains to identify the potential origin of internationally distributed clones that may result in outbreaks; analysis tools to monitor extend of spread based on sequence diversity in relation to control measures; • Outbreak prediction: Automatic analyses for predicting risk of emergence of pathogens with outbreak potential. D. Researchers focusing on these steps team up with system developers that will build a data and information platform supporting rapid sharing, integration and analysis of sequence-based pathogen data in combination with other contextual metadata; FIGURE 2: the COMPARE analytical framework and its main components from sample and data collection to generating actionable information to stakeholders in the human, animal and food sectors. COMPARE 4 E. Risk communication tools will be developed enabling authorities in the human and animal health and food safety sectors to effectively communicate to their stakeholders results obtained with the new analytical workflows; F. The development of the analytical framework is underpinned by a set of supporting research, dissemination and communication activities promoting the acceptance of the system and its components. These activities encompass (i) consultations with our stakeholders serving on expert advisory panels throughout the project to maintain a prominent focus on user needs (ii) studies on the barriers (ethical, regulatory, administrative, logistical, political) to the implementation and widespread use of open-date sharing platforms, (iii) dissemination and training activities; G. Finally COMPARE will include the development of a framework for estimating the cost-effectiveness of the COMPARE system, including the value of safety."

"OZ0347"	"Development of enhanced methods for outbreak investigation and source attribution of Salmonella."	"http://randd.defra.gov.uk//Default.aspx?Menu=Menu&Module=More&Location=None&Completed=2&ProjectID=18884#Description"	"2014"	"2017"	"The Salmonella strain collection held by APHA is a unique and irreplaceable resource of national and international importance. Maintaining a representative collection of well characterised field and reference Salmonella enterica isolates fulfils the need to conserve reference strains for quality control, development of new typing schemes and source that provides a historic context for prospective studies aimed at understanding this important zoonotic pathogen. Furthermore, the application of new low-cost high-throughput technological approaches to study archived strain collections provides the opportunity to retrospectively analyse old collections providing fresh insights into the epidemiology, transmission and disease patterns. A case in point is the opportunity provided by the emergence of next-generation sequencing technology that has in the last few years made whole genome sequencing (WGS) of thousands of bacterial isolates financially viable. In collaboration between the APHA, the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (WTSI) and PHE, we propose to take a methodical approach to evaluate the potential for retrospective analysis of the APHA Salmonella strain collection. The isolates span over 20 years and the majority are of serotypes that have zoonotic potential. Thus investigating this collection in detail will provide data and context relevant not only to animal health, but also human health. The massive strain collection and related epidemiological and spatio-temporal data will be scrutinised using statistical, Bayesian and phylogenetic methods which will then be used to inform selection of strains for comparative WGS to investigate the genetic properties of key Salmonella strains that are associated with their emergence and decline within certain livestock sectors and environmental niches. DNA based methods have been recommended to replace serotyping for strain discrimination. Sequencing a comprehensive background collection of Salmonella isolates of different serovars will facilitate the development of MLST typing scheme for routine use at APHA, which supplemented by even more discriminatory sequence-based typing methods based on entire genomes will increase strain discrimination and provide a clearer picture of long-term transmission. The proposed study will provide: (1) Context for future control programmes and potentially identify genetic markers for low- cost surveillance tests to identify potentially significant new strains at an early stage. (2) This work will generate algorithms, validated by the sequence data that can be used to select representative strains, allowing a rationalisation of current strain storage and consequent cost savings for selection of representative strains from future surveillance. (3) Work on the genetic stability of strains during different storage conditions will lead to optimisation of long-term storage and maintenance of strains in a manner that minimises losses in viability and genetic change making them more valuable to Government and commercial interests for future work. (4) The findings will also feed into Defra components of future EFSA/ECDC initiatives on molecular typing of zoonotic pathogens, particularly in replacement of the reference laboratory serotyping of Salmonella spp. with WGS based typing by defining MLST derived clonal complexes and replacement of the current reference laboratory methods such as phage typing and MLVA/PFGE with
