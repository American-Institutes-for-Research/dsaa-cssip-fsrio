The programme unites efforts of experienced avian immunologists, pathogen specialists and gut flora microbiologists, forming a trans-EU team of scientists to address the complex interactions between the chicken and its microbial environment. The proposed programme of work will deliver a combination of high quality fundamental research and practical outcomes, defining a new framework for selecting pro-biotic formulations to accelerate immune development, improve poultry gut health and reduce pathogen carriage. Specifically, we will determine the effects of pro-biotic formulations of differing complexity on the development of immune capability and the outcome of infection. We will also determine the effects on colonisation, persistence and transmission of Campylobacter and Salmonella. The studies will employ pro-biotic formulations under a variety of conditions to define how these interactions affect pathogen dynamics. We will determine the effects of microflora on development of the chicken intestinal immune system and the reciprocal impact of immunity on the microflora. Similarly, we will define the interactions between natural gut microflora, pro-biotic formulations, housing, chicken strain and infection dynamics. Each of these areas will involve application of established and new methods to determine changes in the immune system, the gut flora and disease transmission dynamics. These analyses will be supported by in vitro approaches to determine the microbial recognition events within the bird (such as those mediated by the avian Pattern Recognition Receptor system). One important anticipated outcome of this work will be to develop a new set of selection criteria for identifying components of defined pro-biotic formulations that can be used to promote the health of poultry and reduce the impact of infections that are pathogenic to poultry or transmitted from poultry to humans. We also expect to discover new pro-biotic components, formulations and delivery criteria that will maximise the impact of these sustainable interventions. Delivery of these outcomes is supported by the within programme links to industry and by employing the experienced technology transfer teams at each institution. In addition to the scientific and practical solutions for the industry the DIFAGH programme will also be a focus for recruitment and training of future generations of researchers in this field."

"OD0556"	"Sheep Scab Host Parasite Interactions"	"http://randd.defra.gov.uk//Default.aspx?Menu=Menu&Module=More&Location=None&Completed=2&ProjectID=18445#Description"	"2013"	"2016"	"Sheep scab, caused by the mite Psoroptes ovis is, arguably, the most important ectoparasitic disease of sheep in the UK and is endemic in the national flock. The disease is highly contagious, causing severe irritation and is a major welfare concern. It is currently controlled using acaricides. However, because of concerns over residues, environmental contamination and drug resistance, this is unsustainable and alternative control methods are needed. Prior infestation with sheep scab alters the progression of any subsequent infestations; lesion size and mite numbers are reduced, offering encouragement for vaccination. Research at MRI has focused on identifying and validating vaccine antigens. This has been informed by a better understanding of the host:parasite interaction, leading to the identification of novel vaccine candidates. Immunisation with a vaccine containing 7 of these candidate molecules prior to infestation with P. ovis resulted in a >50% reduction in lesion area and a significant reduction in mite numbers. This represents the greatest reduction in lesion size with a recombinant sheep scab vaccine and provides real encouragement for future production of a commercially viable means of immunoprophylaxis and we now aim to build upon this success by improving efficacy. P. ovis excretes/secretes a complex repertoire of molecules, triggering an allergic skin response which characterises the disease and creates an environment conducive to mite survival. Identifying immunomodulatory factors produced by parasites is one of the key areas in vaccinology at MRI. The rationale behind using these factors as vaccine candidates is that, if we produce a neutralising host response against them, we can enhance the protective capacity and efficacy of a vaccine. We will therefore focus on identifying P. ovis immuno-modulators to augment the existing vaccine; characterise the nature of the vaccine-induced protective immune response to understand the mechanisms by which vaccination results in reduced pathology and use this information to optimise vaccine delivery. Combining a vaccine and a diagnostic test with targeted acaricidal treatment provides the tools necessary to control sheep scab. With funding from Defra, we developed a specific and sensitive diagnostic test. In partnership with Pfizer Animal Health Ltd and the National Farmer’s Union, Scotland, we will validate this test in the field, as part of our ongoing programme, to determine its utility in local and regional eradication campaigns. Research Aims: i) Identify and characterise P. ovis immunomodulatory factors as additional/augmentative vaccine candidates. ii) Further characterise the mechanisms of vaccine-induced protective immunity. iii) Optimise delivery to stimulate the most appropriate immune response. iv) Validate the sheep scab diagnostic test in the field. By developing sustainable methods for the control of sheep scab based on immunoprophylaxis and subclinical diagnosis, the proposed research programme provides a significant contribution to Defra’s aims of ‘Enhancing the competitiveness and resilience of the food chain and ensuring a secure, environmentally sustainable and healthy supply of food with improved standards of animal welfare’.

Defra funding in the past for MD research was valuable in identifying a number of distinct aspects of MD and maintaining expertise in MD research in the United Kingdom. As part of our research, we have gained significant insights into MD. For example, we have identified several genes, including the MEQ gene and some of the MDV-encoded microRNAs which are directly associated with the induction of cancer. The manipulation of the viral genome to introduce deletions or mutations was possible through the development of infectious bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones of the virus. We have also demonstrated in preliminary studies that viruses deleted in the MEQ gene as well as viruses with deletions of some of the microRNAs can be used as vaccines against virulent MDV. In this project, we want to extent these preliminary studies to examine the efficacy of these viruses as vaccines against different pathogenic virus. Moreover as most of the commercial birds are derived from vaccinated hens and thus have maternal antibodies at hatch, we also want to examine the efficacy of such molecularly-modified vaccines in maternal antibody-positive birds. Until recently, the poultry industry relied mostly on the use of a plethora of live attenuated or inactivated vaccines for the control of infectious diseases. However, there has been an increasing trend in the use of recombinant vectored vaccines, and it is likely that the control of more and more avian diseases will be achieved through the use of recombinant vaccines. Majority of the commercially used recombinant vaccines use the fowl pox virus (FPV) or the herpesvirus of turkeys (HVT) as the vectors. As a virus capable of persisting latently in the vaccinated hosts, HVT-vectored vaccines have been shown to provide long-term protection. In addition to HVT, SB-1 and Rispen’s (CVI988) strains of herpesviruses are also used as vaccines by the poultry industry. However, these strains have not been widely exploited as recombinant vectors. We have previously reported the construction of infectious BAC clones of HVT, SB-1 and CVI988, and have recently shown that HVT BAC clones could be easily manipulated to express foreign genes. In this proposal, we want exploit the use of SB-1 as a recombinant vector against viruses such as IBDV and NDV. MD vaccines, except HVT, are only available as ‘wet vaccines’ to be transported in liquid Nitrogen. This is because these vaccines are cell-associated and the infectivity relies on the use of live infected cells for vaccination. HVT on the other hand, can produce cell-free virus at least partially, and hence is also available as freeze dried ‘dry’ vaccines. As part of the previous project, we have identified the association of some of the HVT glycoproteins in cell-free virus production. We want to explore the functions of these glycoproteins in order to understand the determinants of cell-free virus production, and examine the possibility of developing novel cell-free viruses with the serotype 1 MDV."

Escherichia coli (E. coli) is a major causal agent of ""clinical"" mastitis which frequently occurs after parturition and in the early lactation period. Incidence of E. coli mastitis has been increasing relentlessly over recent years and usually presents with acute, severe clinical effects for which current management, prevention or treatment strategies are frequently insufficient or futile. E. coli is a common resident in the intestine and adaptation of specific strains (Mammary Pathogenic E. coli - MPEC) to intra-mammary infection and the emergence of bacterial resistance to current antibiotics present ongoing risks to control measures. While the few available E. coli mastitis vaccines are beneficial, they have debatable efficacy. Hence, adequate control of E. coli mastitis urgently requires a novel generation of immunity-promoting products and/or other treatments. To significantly improve clinical mastitis control, cross-disciplinary collaboration is mandatory. Our international consortium proposes an innovative strategy with strongly linked goals: extensive genomic and phenotypic characterization of MPEC strains; identification of novel critical inflammatory factors both at the bacterial and host response level using advanced molecular tools and complementary in vivo models; and, definition of key innate and adaptive immune cell determinants of this inflammation-mediated pathology with emphasis towards protective immune responses. This combined gain in fundamental knowledge on the host-pathogen interactions in E. coli mastitis will support selection of novel candidates for evaluation as diagnostic, immunoprophylactic or therapeutic targets. Participation in this project of an international company at the leading edge of delivering animal health solutions ensures delivery of translational outcomes for disease control through the knowledge gained on the interaction between MPEC and cattle."

"http://randd.defra.gov.uk//Default.aspx?Menu=Menu&Module=More&Location=None&Completed=2&ProjectID=17666#Description"	"2013"	"2018"	"Escherichia coli are common Gram-negative bacteria that form a normal part of the gut flora of humans and animals. However, among the different pathotypes of E. coli some can cause human disease, with the verocytotoxigenic E. coli (VTEC) serotype O157:H7 being one of the most virulent and widespread causing haemorrhagic colitis and haemolytic uraemic syndrome. In 2009, an outbreak of VTEC O157:H7 led to severe illness in a number of visitors to an open farm in Surrey with several cases of life-threatening haemolytic uraemic syndrome in young children. VTEC O157 can be found in several livestock species without causing clinical symptoms in these animals, and the main reservoir seems to be cattle, in particular youngstock. Campylobacteriosis is the most common cause of acute bacterial enteritis in the UK with the main food borne source being poultry meat. In order to prevent carry-over of pathogens from one group of animals to the next and from animals to people, disinfectants are applied to surfaces in animal accommodation. A wide range of products belonging to several groups of chemicals are licensed and used for this purpose, but not all disinfectants are equally effective. While the presence of organic matter does affect the efficacy of all disinfectants to some degree, some are more effective than others in the presence of organic matter due to their chemical properties. In addition to disinfection of surfaces, boot dips are in use on many farms to prevent carry-over of pathogens between different groups of animals. However, disinfectants in boot dips need to be particularly effective in the presence of faecal matter, and previous studies have found that boot dips as currently used in many livestock enterprises are often not efficient barriers to infection and may therefore represent a waste of resources leading to a false sense of security. On many farms, hand sanitizers are used where hand washing facilities are not feasible to reduce the bacterial count on hands and gloves. The use of hand sanitizers has been recommended as a key element of biosecurity, but little hard data exists on efficacy against VTEC O157 or Campylobacter. The proposed work will provide robust data on the best performing disinfectants to be used against VTEC O157 and Campylobacter on livestock premises and will give guidance on which products are most suitable for the different types of applications. These results will be of high practical value and will be used in the future to better inform farmers about the most suitable products they should use to control those bacteria. Several studies suggest that exposure of VTEC O157:H7 to biocides may to lead to an adaptive response which is also likely to lead to cross-resistance to other antimicrobials and biocides. However, the adaptive response mounted is likely to be dependent on the biocide used, its concentration, the number of times and duration of each exposure. The aim of the molecular component of this project is to assess these factors critically at the molecular level using global gene expression studies to understand the basis of development of biocide resistance in VTEC O157 strains and determine conditions which are least likely to lead to such resistances in future, so an effective method may be recommended for long term use on farms as a result of this study. In addition to the expected scientific results, the proposed work on VTEC O157 will help maintain expertise on working with this pathogen in category 3 facilities at AHVLA Weybridge and also allow for training of two members of staff to work on VTEC O157 to allow continuity of this work at the Weybridge site following the upcoming retirement of currently trained staff. The proposed Campylobacter work will contribute to the maintenance of expertise on Campylobacter at the AHVLA and the development of laboratory methods.

Future regulatory and NCP targets are therefore likely to be very difficult to achieve. There is an urgent need to investigate in detail the effectiveness of control measures in the field, to define the best and most cost-effective methods, their benefit in terms of reduction of public health risk and other pathogens of economic importance in pig production and to effectively transmit the resulting information and guidance to pig producers in a highly motivational way. It is necessary to focus on farm reduction as well as measures in the abattoir as the latter can be undermined by high levels of infection in slaughter pigs and highly infected farms form a reservoir of Salmonella that can spread to other livestock sectors, feed production and contaminate the rural environment. Objective one focuses on a detailed investigation of the protective factors that operated on low (<10% incidence) Salmonella seroprevalence pig farms, the so called ‘Platinum Pig farms’. Previous limited work and a small number of detailed AHVLA investigations of zero-seroprevalence farms have suggested that management of the time of exposure to infection to enhance ‘herd-immunity’ in finishing pigs is critical. We will carry out intensive veterinary microbiological investigations linked with a case control study to further elucidate protective factors on low prevalence farms. Objective two recognises international scientific evidence that there is no single control measure, or simple combination of control measures that can be successfully and economically applied to all pig farms and so a targeted farm-specific control plan is needed. Accredited pig farms are required to have a Salmonella control action plan in place but this can be a general tick-box exercise and is not based on bacteriological evidence, or monitored for effectiveness. Specific interventions such as feed or water acidification, vaccination, improved cleaning and disinfection of finishing pens, improved pest control, all-in/all out production, changes in feed formulation etc. can be included in such control plans and are being trialled by BPEX, pig veterinarians and pig farming companies in various uncontrolled and statistically non-valid ways. We will aim to link with such initiatives to provide statistical input and detailed investigation of the effects of such farm control plans on Salmonella and other production-limiting conditions. We will apply cost analyses and QMRA studies to these, evaluate compliance and refine applications to demonstrate the effectiveness of properly targeted approaches. Objective three will involve further refinement of the BPEX/FSA farm auditing tool to target it more effectively to evaluate measures associated with improved Salmonella control. Objective four will supply detailed data on the most effective detergent/sanitizers and disinfectants to use for porcine Salmonella.

Maintaining a representative collection of well characterised field and reference Salmonella enterica isolates fulfils the need to conserve reference strains for quality control, development of new typing schemes and source that provides a historic context for prospective studies aimed at understanding this important zoonotic pathogen. Furthermore, the application of new low-cost high-throughput technological approaches to study archived strain collections provides the opportunity to retrospectively analyse old collections providing fresh insights into the epidemiology, transmission and disease patterns. A case in point is the opportunity provided by the emergence of next-generation sequencing technology that has in the last few years made whole genome sequencing (WGS) of thousands of bacterial isolates financially viable. In collaboration between the APHA, the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (WTSI) and PHE, we propose to take a methodical approach to evaluate the potential for retrospective analysis of the APHA Salmonella strain collection. The isolates span over 20 years and the majority are of serotypes that have zoonotic potential. Thus investigating this collection in detail will provide data and context relevant not only to animal health, but also human health. The massive strain collection and related epidemiological and spatio-temporal data will be scrutinised using statistical, Bayesian and phylogenetic methods which will then be used to inform selection of strains for comparative WGS to investigate the genetic properties of key Salmonella strains that are associated with their emergence and decline within certain livestock sectors and environmental niches. DNA based methods have been recommended to replace serotyping for strain discrimination. Sequencing a comprehensive background collection of Salmonella isolates of different serovars will facilitate the development of MLST typing scheme for routine use at APHA, which supplemented by even more discriminatory sequence-based typing methods based on entire genomes will increase strain discrimination and provide a clearer picture of long-term transmission. The proposed study will provide: (1) Context for future control programmes and potentially identify genetic markers for low- cost surveillance tests to identify potentially significant new strains at an early stage. (2) This work will generate algorithms, validated by the sequence data that can be used to select representative strains, allowing a rationalisation of current strain storage and consequent cost savings for selection of representative strains from future surveillance. (3) Work on the genetic stability of strains during different storage conditions will lead to optimisation of long-term storage and maintenance of strains in a manner that minimises losses in viability and genetic change making them more valuable to Government and commercial interests for future work. (4) The findings will also feed into Defra components of future EFSA/ECDC initiatives on molecular typing of zoonotic pathogens, particularly in replacement of the reference laboratory serotyping of Salmonella spp. with WGS based typing by defining MLST derived clonal complexes and replacement of the current reference laboratory methods such as phage typing and MLVA/PFGE with SNP based phylogenies for strain resolution."

This has been in place since 1985 and is of great economic value to the nation. To maintain freedom of disease the nation must rapidly identify and then resolve outbreaks of disease. This may occur via re-importation of infected animals or even re-emergence from an environmental source. The aim of this project is to improve the tools available to detect, trace and eradicate any reintroduction of disease as well as to better facilitate the efficient maintenance of disease free status. This project aims to improve the specificity of immunological assays for the indirect detection of brucellosis in livestock. The currently available tests are vulnerable to cross reactions due to infection with some non-Brucella organisms. The aim is to improve specificity through the design, synthesis and application of cutting edge oligosaccharide antigens which contain only the unique structural elements of the dominant Brucella antigen. The native antigen contains these epitopes within polymers which also contain common epitopes. The project also supports the production, purification and investigation of other abundant surface antigens, such as the rough lipopolysaccharide, that we will derive from Brucella culture. Direct detection methods have potentially greater specificity than immunological tests. The challenge is that Brucella occurs at very low levels in accessible clinical material such as milk and blood. Therefore a means to improve the direct detection of Brucella DNA will be developed and evaluated. This method will combine two powerful techniques, immuno-capture and Real Time PCR, to increase the concentration of target DNA in biological samples in a manner compatible with specific application by PCR. Anti-Brucella antibodies will be coupled to small magnetic beads which will be dispersed and incubated within biological samples. Any Brucella cells present in the samples will specifically bind to the antibodies on the beads. These beads can be concentrated and washed with the aid of magnets such that any captured Brucella cells remain surface bound. The cells, and their DNA, can then be delivered to the PCR reaction. The third challenge to be addressed is to improve the means by which outbreaks of disease can be traced back to source. Traditional classification methods have very low ability to differentiate strains from the same Brucella species and biovar. DNA based molecular methods have greatly improved resolving and identification capability. However, the DNA of different strains of Brucella frequently have such similar DNA sequences that even these methods lack power. This project will combine whole genome sequencing and bioinformatics tools to maximise the ability to differentiate between strains of Brucella. Working with samples from the APHA archive and sourced from international partners we shall construct a database of whole genome sequences such that the ability to identify the source of any disease outbreaks is improved."

"SE0430"	"Mammalian vectors of exotic diseases, including rabies"	"http://randd.defra.gov.uk//Default.aspx?Menu=Menu&Module=More&Location=None&Completed=2&ProjectID=19597#Description"	"2015"	"2018"	"The Defra policies of “protecting animal health and preventing disease” and “protecting animal welfare” are both helped by avoiding the incursion of exotic diseases, which may infect livestock or wildlife. Rabies is one of many exotic wildlife diseases which threaten the UK. The OIE lists rabies, Echinococcus multilocularis and Trichinella infection as notifiable, amongst others. The current wildlife rabies contingency plan is very well developed, and has been repeatedly tested in numerous training exercises. This plan involves both the logistical aspects of eradication in wildlife and the predictive simulation modelling to enable a geographically specific contingency plan to be developed. The team responsible for putting the plan into action will be working on this research project to ensure the wildlife diseases contingency plan is refined, improved and broadened to include as many exotic diseases as possible. We propose that this work will progress in these two related areas to permit our current rabies response to be adapted for a more generic wildlife disease situation, as well as ensuring that the rabies contingency plan stays up to date. This will significantly increase our ability to respond to and control any wildlife disease incursion, and the ability to respond timely and proportionately will minimise any upstream costs to government and the taxpayer of new diseases becoming endemic. Additionally, this ability to minimise the time to disease eradication will reduce the time that businesses remain under official restrictions. The establishment and spread of the OIE listed diseases above will probably be heavily dependent on the urban fox density, since this is the greatest opportunity for introduction of infection, allied with the highest available densities. We propose to update urban fox density data by collaborating with ongoing studies. We also propose to refine all mammalian density estimates based on available systematic data collection to ensure that the underlying data for wildlife diseases are available. Computer modelling for exotic disease management is a growing area, and we plan to investigate the potential for eradication of exotic disease other than rabies."	"1.

Recent experience has shown that the European livestock industry is vulnerable to a range of exotic infections, with outbreaks of Bluetongue, Avian Influenza and Schmallenberg virus highlighting how widely and rapidly pathogenic infections can spread. In part this spread represents the natural ability of the pathogen to pass between hosts, but this is exasperated by the (long-distance) movement of animals between farms and by the unknown dispersal of disease vectors, which play a crucial role in spreading of infection for a range of diseases. Often these vectors are biting insects (such as mosquitoes or midges) that pass infection as they feed, however, other physical or biological mechanisms can act as vectors for transmission – from vehicle movements between farms to spread by other host organisms such as local wildlife. To plan and prepare for future outbreaks we will develop mathematical models that can integrate these processes that act over different spatial and temporal scales. Such models will then be used to determine how to optimize surveillance for emerging outbreaks or novel vectors, infer key parameters from early outbreak data, and predict optimal control strategies for known or hypothetical scenarios. Our approach is to formulate a general modelling framework for the spread of vector-borne (and non-vector-borne) livestock diseases and to enhance surveillance technologies for vectors. The modelling framework will consist of three parts: one that deals with the spread between nearby premises as captured by a local transmission kernel; one that handles the potentially long-range spread of infection through the movement of animals within and between countries in Europe; and another that explores the diffusive spread by a vector population either biting insects or other host species. We will strengthen the theoretical model development by applying the framework to three specific vector borne diseases: Rift Valley Fever (a potential zoonosis), Bluetongue, and African Swine Fever Virus. The generic framework and specific modelling examples will produce a range of policy-relevant results that will be shared through our strong links with national and European animal health agencies. Throughout, mathematical models will be employed to generate robust practical advice that can have a direct impact on policy and the EU livestock industry. Our proposed work fits within topic 3 of the ANIHWA call “Improvement of preparedness for emerging and exotic diseases” and will address all of the aspects listed. In particular our main focus is on model development for vector-borne diseases, but this necessitates a more quantitative understanding of vectors; it will lead to predictions for the optimal use of sentinel traps, early warning systems and a range of intervention strategies. In addition the generality of our modelling approach means that role of wildlife as vectors or reservoirs can be studied within the same framework."	"This project aims to create the knowledge, mathematical frameworks and computational technologies to increase the effectiveness of detecting, controlling and eradicating emerging and exotic (vector-borne) infectious diseases in European livestock. Our approach is based on four complementary and synergistic scientific work packages (WP1-4) that play to the strengths of the five partner institutions (Warwick, Linkoping, UPMC, IZSAM & Wageningen): WP1 is focused towards developing the necessary mathematical formulation to capture the range of transmission routes of livestock infections in a heterogeneous spatial environment. This will be complemented by efficient computer code and approximations that will permit a thorough investigation of infection spread and control in later work packages. WP2 aims to develop robust and effective tools for monitoring and surveillance of (arthropod) vectors of diseases affecting livestock and wild animals. As such it will provide much needed data on vector abundance in four exemplar regions, together with effective ways in which biting densities can be estimated during future outbreaks. WP3 integrates the models of WP1 with the data generated by WP2, and places both in a realistic context of farm locations, animal movements and environmental variables. This allows us to consider potential future outbreaks (reflecting a range of parameters) to assess their likely impact and the effectiveness of control measures. WP4 focuses on four infectious diseases of livestock that are considered economically important and scientifically representative, and where good epidemiological data is available: Rift Valley Fever (vector-borne by mosquitoes with zoonotic potential); Bluetongue (vector-borne by Culicoides midges); African Swine Fever (ticks as potential vectors); Swine Vesicular disease (direct and indirect transmission). In addition WP5 and WP6 deal with dissemination of findings to both the scientific and wider community, and management of the collaboration, resources and data."

It is an important pre-requisite for preparedness and rapid response. These risk assessments are typically complex and data-hungry, limiting the real-world applicability in the event of a novel disease outbreak. However, the European Union (EU) maintains a number of extensive and real time datasets. Further data on global presence of disease is available through datasets held by the OIE, WAHID. The objective of the project is to develop an overarching model to make rapid use of available metadata to identify pathways of potential risk for classes of disease transmission (e.g. vector borne). This framework will provide invaluable information for risk assessors in the first instances of a disease outbreak where typically information on imports and routes of entry and potential for spread is undertaken on a case-by-case basis. It will also allow for an objective and systematic evaluation to inform risk-based animal health and zoonotic surveillance activities, either generically or for specific diseases. The framework will be readily adaptable not only to specific disease hazards, but also to broad classes of disease, defined by their mode of transmission. To assure feasibility and focus, the project will group biological hazards into distinct mode-of-transmission classes and develop a case study for each. For the release assessment, relevant incidence data from exporting countries will be combined with trade data, air passenger information, road transport data, and vector movement to identify important trade/movement routes from relevant geographical regions. The exposure assessment will identify the potential spread of disease via competent vectors by member state and for exposure of domestic livestock and/or humans by population density mapping and be used to inform efficient surveillance designs. Encompassing all areas in the project will be a communication network, ensuring that the modelling work builds from previous work in this area and is fit to provide scientific support to decision makers. In the event of an incursion, risk management decisions are to be taken under significant time constraints. The project will specifically address this dialogue and propose processes taking into account existing organisations and structures, to assure a rapid translation from science into policy."

FMD remains endemic in many countries in Africa and Asia. In addition, sporadic outbreaks of disease frequently occur in countries that are normally free from disease such as those recently in Japan, South Korea, Russia, and extensively in PR China. These outbreaks reinforce the concerns about how readily the disease can pass across international borders. FMD is difficult and expensive to control since the causative virus (FMDV) is highly contagious and spreads rapidly through susceptible animals. In the event of an introduction into the UK, successful control and eradication of FMD is dependent upon early recognition of infected animals to reduce the potential for onward transmission of the virus to cause subsequent outbreaks. Accurate tests that can detect FMDV, or FMDV-specific antibody in clinical material play central roles in these activities. The aim of this project is to maintain and improve laboratory-based diagnostic methods for FMD, as well as to continue to evaluate technologies that allow rapid testing to be achieved in the field or in regional laboratories. The focus of this new project will be to develop enhanced virological and serological tests for the diagnosis of FMD, to ensure that the routine diagnostic systems used within the FMD National Reference Laboratory are able to respond rapidly to the threats of FMD incursion into the UK. This proposal covers specific areas that represent key Defra priorities: (i) Molecular and serological tools for earlier detection of FMDV infected livestock (ii) Improved high through-put approaches to monitor and control FMD incursions (iii) Tests that can be used for rapid identification of infected animals as the basis for more targeted control, with a consequent reduction in the costs of FMD outbreaks (industry and government), and (iv) To provide an evidence base to support a future reduction in the length of time businesses remained under official restrictions Research themes will center on the development, evaluation and validation of assays that can detect the presence of FMDV (and can differentiate from other viruses causing vesicular diseases), or serological tests that can be used to identify animals that have been previously exposed to FMD, particularly those within a vaccinated population according to the EU Directive and Recommendations of OIE. In addition, improved methods will be developed to detect “carrier” animals that are associated with persistent replication of virus. Together, the outputs from this project will provide Defra with increased confidence in using such assays for diagnosis and surveillance in the event of future outbreaks of FMD, and provide tools that can be used in post-outbreak surveillance to regain FMD-free status in the UK."	"Objectives: 1. Virological tests, to detect FMDV in clinical or preclinical specimens collected from animals, including: a. Virus isolation in cell culture systems to propagate “live” FMDV (and other viruses causing signs of vesicular disease in cloven-hoofed livestock). b. Immunoassays such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) to detect FMD viral antigen in clinical specimens and material from cell culture tests. c. Molecular tests such as real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) to detect viral genome (RNA). 2. Serological tests, to recognise animals that have been previously exposed to FMDV (or FMDV vaccine) comprising: a. Immunoassays and cell-based virus neutralisation assays to detect antibodies against the structural proteins (SPs) of FMDV. b.

It was an aim of the NSP to reduce frequencies of the VRQ PrP gene allele in sheep, the allele associated with one of the main groups of scrapie strains. Indirectly this has resulted in an increase in the relative numbers of animals encoding ARQ alleles and which will support both atypical and classical scrapie, including strains which have similarities to BSE in Western blot pattern of disease related PrP. These BSE-like strains have in the past produced major concerns that BSE had infected sheep in national flocks and considerable work was required to demonstrate that, although some scrapie strains have BSE-like features, they are not BSE. CH1641 is the archetype of such BSE-like scrapie strains but others have been described throughout Europe. It is possible in the UK that CH1641-like strains could occur in a mixed infection with atypical scrapie, potentially causing BSE-in-sheep scares and but also possibly resulting in the emergence of a novel combined strain with unknown risks for animals and humans. It is important therefore to study CH1641 in more detail. Previous studies in this lab (SE1429 and SE1436) and elsewhere have observed the changing characteristics of BSE in mixed infections with scrapie in sheep, however it could be argued it is now more likely that CH1641-like classical scrapie strains might be found in mixed infections of sheep with atypical scrapie and nothing is known about this potential phenomenon or the risks developing from such a mixed infection. This proposal aims therefore to address the issue using both sheep and transgenic mice using standard strain typing methodologies to gain information on how mixed scrapie/atypical scrapie infection would appear to those conducting surveillance testing for sheep TSE infections. The benefits of this proposed study will be realised by increasing our understanding of how TSE strains interact under controlled conditions, particularly those ARQ-targetting strains likely now to predominate in the UK and Europe as a result of breeding against VRQ alleles. It is likely that novel strains will emerge following some kind of selection process during infections in sheep with PrP genotypes not normally affected by scrapie and/or when strains inadvertently interact in rare multiple infections of individuals or flocks. In order to be prepared to deal with emerging TSE strains in the future, this project will provide crucial and different information on strain interactions to that which we have already generated on mixed TSE strain infections for VRQ-targetting scrapie strains in sheep (SE1436) and mice (SE1429). These existing and completed projects will provide tissues for laboratory studies and contribute to minimising costs. Understanding of how ARQ targeting strains of TSEs interact will contribute to the primary objective (2.2) of Defra’s Livestock – TSE and ABP evidence plan 2011/12 which aims to cope with potential threats from new or re-emerging TSEs."

In 2007 the disease was restricted to sub-saharan Africa and Sardinia but in that year spread to Georgia in the Trans Caucasus region and from there to neighbouring countries including the Russian Federation. In Russia spread of ASF has been dramatic and the situation is now considered to be out of control, raising fears of further spread to other countries in particular the EU, Eastern Europe and China. Indeed the first introduction to Ukraine was reported in the summer of 2012. This project aims to improve tools to control ASF by following three complimentary objectives. The first objective is to collect data on the effectiveness of transmission between infected and naive pigs within pens and between pens which share the same air space. Quantitative data on virus excretions and environmental contamination will also be gathered. The experiments will be carried out using a virus isolate from the Caucasus as strains from this region and Russia represent the greatest threat of spread to the EU. These experiments will provide information for modelling the spread of disease and thus help focus control measures effectively. A vaccine is not available to protect pigs against ASF and this limits options for disease control. Our second objective will build on data from our previous project aimed at identifying those ASFV proteins which can induce a protective response in pigs. In our previous project we screened a wide pool of the more than 150 proteins ASFV codes for and identified 20 of those to focus on for vaccine development. In this project we will identify 5 proteins from these 20 which can induce protection. This smaller number of ASFV proteins could realistically be incorporated into a commercially produced vaccine. The third objective focuses on methods for diagnosis of ASF. The initial confirmation of an outbreak of ASF will require isolation of the virus in cell culture. Currently there is no established cell line available for ASFV isolation and growth. Instead primary cells have to be prepared for this purpose directly from pigs. We have obtained, through collaboration, a pig macrophage cell line and have shown that these can be infected by ASFV. In this project we will further validate the use of this cell line for diagnosis and growth of ASFV by comparing infection and virus growth rates in the cell line to those obtained in primary cells. Use of this cell line would offer a major advantage in terms of consistency of results, ease of obtaining cells and avoiding the use of animals."	"The overall objective of the project is to improve the tools available for control of African swine fever by completing three independent but complimentary objectives. 1 To obtain data on the effectiveness of different ASFV transmission routes for use in development of a disease transmission model. 2. To identify a pool of 5 ASFV antigens which induce protection in pigs for incorporation into virus vectored vaccines. 3. To validate the use of a pig macrophage cell line for virus isolation and diagnosis."

Recently we have demonstrated that it is possible to detect environmental scrapie contamination biochemically using serial Protein Misfolding Cyclic Amplification (sPMCA)2, allowing the monitoring of scrapie infectivity on farm premises. Ongoing Defra study SE1863 has compared pen decontamination regimes on a scrapie-infected farm by both sheep bioassay and sPMCA. For bioassay, scrapie-free genetically susceptible lambs were introduced into pens decontaminated using distinct methodologies, all pens contained scrapie-positive lambs within 1 year. Remarkably this included lambs housed within a pen which had been jet washed/chloros treated, followed by regalvanisation/ replacement of all metalwork and painting of all other surfaces. We have recently demonstrated using sPMCA, that material collected on swabs from vertical surfaces at heights inaccessible to sheep within a barn on the same scrapie affected farm contained scrapie prions (unpublished observations). We hypothesise that scrapie prions are most likely to have been deposited in these areas by bioaerosol movement. We propose that this bioaerosol movement contributes to scrapie transmission within the barn, and could account for the sheep that became positive within the pen containing re-galvanised/new metalwork and repainted surfaces (project SE1863). It is proposed that a thorough decontamination that would minimise prion-contaminated dust, both within the building and its immediate vicinity, is likely to increase the effectiveness of current methods for decontaminating farm buildings following outbreaks of scrapie. The proposed study builds on our previous data and will thoroughly investigate the potential for farm building scrapie-contamination via the bioaerosol route, a previously unrecognised route for dissemination of scrapie infectivity. This route could lead to the direct infection of healthy animals and/or indirect transmission of disease via contamination of surfaces within animal pens. The proposed study would analyse material collected using air samplers set up within “scrapie-infected” barns and their immediate vicinity, to confirm that prion containing material can be airborne within a scrapie infected farm environment. The study would incorporate a biochemical assessment of different surface decontamination methods, in order to demonstrate the best methodology and then the analysis of air and surface samples after a complete building decontamination to remove sources of dust and surface bound prions from both the building and its immediate vicinity. Analysis of such surface and air samples collected before and after treatment would measure the reduction in levels of infectivity. It is envisaged that the biochemical demonstration of airborne prions and the effective reduction in such prion dissemination would lead to a sheep bioassay experiment that would be conducted after a full farm decontamination. This would fully assess the effectiveness of an optimised scrapie decontamination strategy. This study will contribute directly to Defra policy on best practice for on-farm decontamination after outbreaks of scrapie; a situation particularly relevant to decontamination after scrapie cases on goat farms where no genetic resistance to scrapie has currently been identified, and where complete decontamination is essential in order to stop recurrence of scrapie after restocking."

There is also a specific requirement for small ruminant positive samples to be further tested to determine if the strain of TSE present is bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) rather than scrapie, given that this strain is the only one currently known to be zoonotic. The age groups and total numbers of animals tested are modified based on the disease trends identified by this surveillance process, with the aim of reducing the overall cost of testing as outlined in the TSE roadmap 2, published by the European Commission and endorsed in general by Defra. However, within the last decade, as the numbers of BSE and scrapie cases have dropped dramatically, this active surveillance has identified atypical variants in both sheep (Nor98/atypical scrapie) and cattle (L-type BSE/bovine amyloidotic spongiform encephalopathy), and H-type BSE). While it has been proposed that these rare forms of disease are spontaneous, it has also been shown that transmission can be achieved experimentally into a range of host species (cattle, sheep, transgenic mice, primates) and there is evidence that the disease characteristics do not remain stable in some cases. Given that there is still no robust understanding of what makes a particular TSE isolate zoonotic, it is important that we have as broad an understanding and awareness of how such isolates present in food animal species, and how stable they are on inter- and intra-species transmission. They need to be characterised as fully as possible to assist with accurate detection and classification of these cases should they occur in field situations, and to underpin informed assessment of risk to both human and animal health. This is in keeping with one of Defra’s stated aims (in “Livestock - TSE and animal by products evidence plan 2011/12” ) that one of the highest research priorities is to ensure preparedness to detect and evaluate new or unusual TSEs. Emerging data from an existing Defra project investigating the disease produced by experimental infection of sheep with atypical BSE sources (SE1860) suggests that the clinical disease which results would not be considered as suspect TSE by current criteria, and although a positive diagnosis would be obtained through active surveillance, classification of the strain would be problematic using existing methods. However, experimental challenge of cattle (EU funded) resulted in retention of all diagnostic characteristics of the infecting strain. We propose to use material from these sheep and cattle studies to look at whether our existing bioassay techniques can still classify the agent strain, and whether the strains retain or lose specific identifying characteristics when they are passaged through cattle and sheep more than once. This will complement the data on the intra- and inter-species challenges being undertaken with atypical scrapie (SE1847 and separate study submitted for funding by Defra)"	"1.

These requirements are subject to modifications given the decline of BSE cases within Europe and the high costs of testing cattle, which was outlined in the Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy (TSE) Roadmap 2, published by the European Commission and endorsed in general by Defra. However, it was emphasised that the ability to detect new forms of TSEs in cattle must be maintained, which requires investigation of the full spectrum of TSEs that may occur in cattle. Studies in cattle experimentally infected with naturally occurring TSE agents have been used to determine the disease forms and to investigate whether the current tests were able to diagnose and distinguish them from classical BSE, the disease responsible for the UK epidemic. These disease forms were diagnosed successfully by these tests. Another naturally occurring TSE has been recently found in UK sheep and named “atypical scrapie” to distinguish it from the classical form known in the UK for centuries. Atypical scrapie has been found retrospectively in sheep killed around the same time as the first cases of BSE were reported in the UK and is likely to have occurred even earlier. It is not known whether atypical scrapie can transmit to cattle, how the disease looks like and whether it can be diagnosed by the tests applied to brain samples. As body parts of sheep scrapie cases almost definitely have been processed to meat and bone meal (MBM), which is believed to be the source of the BSE epidemic in the UK by feeding it to cattle, cattle are likely to have ingested MBM contaminated with the atypical scrapie agent. The proposed study aims to determine whether atypical scrapie from sheep can transmit to cattle and to characterise the resulting disease. This will be achieved by inoculating five cattle with a brain from a clinically affected atypical scrapie sheep by the intracerebral route, which is known to be the most effective route to produce disease. Five control cattle will be similarly inoculated with saline solution. Cattle will be culled upon development of clinical disease, which together with the findings from the diagnostic tests, will enable us to describe the disease in full detail and compare it with BSE. Control animals culled at the same time as diseased animals will enable comparison with changes occurring due to age or the environment. The brain of the sheep used for inoculation has been inoculated into mice to determine the biological characteristics of this particular TSE agent (funded by other projects); we will similarly inoculate two groups of ten mice with brain material from the first clinically affected animal to assess whether the biological properties have changed after transmission to cattle. Overall, this project will further our understanding of the range of BSE forms that may be present in the cattle population."

Data generated concerning the origins, movement, genetic composition and evolution of economically important orbiviruses that threaten Europe and the UK, provides a basis for development of novel diagnostic assays and risk assessment. Relevant data and analyses will be provided to Defra, the EU, OIE and other national authorities to inform policy decisions concerning appropriate surveillance and control strategies. The global ‘Orbivirus Reference Collection’ (ORC) and sequence-databases (http://www.reoviridae.org/dsRNA_virus_proteins/ReoID/orbiviruses.htm) will be maintained. These important national and international resources, provide data and materials for molecular epidemiology studies and the design / validation of diagnostic assays and vaccines. The European BTV Reference Laboratory, Headed by Dr Carrie Batten has helped detect, type and trace the origins of European BTV outbreak-strains from each year since 1998, including BTV-8 which spread to the UK during 2007. A novel 26th serotype of BTV was identified in Kuwait during 2010, which does not infect adult Culicoides or a Culicoides cell line (KC cells) but can be transmitted horizontally between goats. The recent re-emergence of BTV-8 in central France (in 2015) and continuing transmission of BTV-4 in South Eastern Europe highlight threats posed by BT incursions into central and northern Europe (including the UK). The transmission of both AHSV and EHDV by the same insect-vectors (Culicoides spp.) suggests that they could also spread to/in Europe. Phylogenetic studies of European BTV isolates recently demonstrated the significance of genome-segment exchange (reassortment) in the evolution and emergence of these viruses. The project will isolate and characterise orbivirus strains from outbreaks in Europe and other geographic regions of the world, maintaining the ORC and sequence-database. Full-genome sequences for novel viruses will provide information concerning their origins, movements and evolution. Reassortant genotypes will be identified and characterised, to help assess the risks they represent to Europe and the UK. Specific reassortant strains (e.g. between BTV-1 and BTV-26) will also be generated by reverse-genetics to assess the role of individual genome-segments and viral-proteins (genetic-markers) in control/restriction of infection and replication in Culicoides cells. These data and reassortant-strains will be made available to other projects to determine the significance of individual genome-segments / proteins in transmission by adult Culicoides, or horizontal spread between ruminants. The major outcome of this programme will be provision of data and reference materials to maintain, improve, and validate molecular assays (maintaining diagnostic capability), and for selection, development and testing of novel vaccines by commercial partners. Multiplex typing assays will be developed to increase the speed and reduce costs of surveillance; also reducing the risk that mixed BTV infections will go undetected. Outer-capsid protein VP2 from different BTV serotypes will be expressed in plants and evaluated in serotype-specific ELISA that could potentially replace neutralisation tests to identifying BTV serotype, or BTV serotype-specific antibodies."

In this programme of work we will study in detail the early stages of FMDV infection in cattle to identify which specific samples can be used to detect virus production before the onset of clinical signs and transmission occurs. Specifically, we aim to develop methods to sample large numbers of animals quickly and efficiently to detect virus as early as possible. Our previous studies have shown virus can be detected in the throat and in the breath of animals before clinical signs are seen and transmission is likely to occur. We will continue these studies with an emphasis on developing practical sampling methods. We will liaise closely with the diagnostics group to utilize the most sensitive methods to detect virus or viral genome in the samples collected. Prompt identification of infected animals needs to be tied in with rapid deployment of control measures. One arm of an effective control strategy could be to establish an immune barrier around the infected premises. To facilitate the rapid deployment of vaccine we have produced stabilised FMDV capsids (virus coat) for use as vaccines. We plan to produce vaccines that can be stored as formulated products and which provide enhanced protection compared to current vaccines. Specifically, we have developed a baculovirus (insect cell) expression system that can incorporate sequences from different FMDV isolates to produce empty FMDV capsids. Proof of principle experiments have demonstrated that the use of recombinant technology to produce FMDV empty capsids with improved physical stability results in a vaccine that induces potent protective immune responses. We will now focus, with a commercial partner, on providing evidence to support applications for market authorization of these vaccines so they can be used in a FMDV outbreak. Capsids will be expressed from all of the viruses identified as high priority for an emergency vaccine bank by Defra and the FMD World reference laboratory. The immunogenicity of the resulting capsids will be tested in guinea pigs and cattle to ensure rapid induction of protective immune responses. We will also continue to optimize the expression, purification and storage characteristics of the FMDV capsids to produce stockpiles of vaccines to control the spread of FMDV."	"The project involves two independent components. The first relates to early detection of FMD (objective 1) and quantifying indirect transmission route probabilities (objective 2). The second component will focus on producing a stockpile of FMDV empty capsids for use as an emergency vaccine bank (objective 3). 1. To address the identification of early biomarkers of FMD infection requires a series of experiments to infect cattle under controlled conditions and to take samples at different stages of the infection process. The outputs of these experiments will be: 1.1. Evaluation of the diagnostic efficacy (Sensitivity and Specificity) of the tests used to detect FMDV early biomarkers (time post infection becomes a very important component of this evaluation). 1.2. Development of a model for early detection during post-outbreak surveillance. This will determine sample size and frequency of sampling. This will apply mainly to swab or direct sampling or aerosol sampling directly from the animals. In case of herd sampling (air samples), it will help determine sampling frequency. 2. Quantifying the rate of FMD transmission by indirect routes also requires a series of experimental infections, but including exposure of naïve animals to fomites and to aerosols. The outputs of these experiments will be: 2.1. An estimate of the tranmsission rate for indirect FMD spread between calves via environmental fomite contamination. 2.2. An estimate of the transmission rate for indirect FMD spread between calves via short-distance aerosol spread. 3. Produce a FMDV emergency vaccine bank based on empty capsids produced using baculovirus expression systems. The outputs of these experiments will be: 3.1. Express FMDV capsids using baculovirus expression for high priority vaccine bank strains. 3.2. Further development of methods to quantify whole capsids in baculovirus infected cell cultures. 3.3. Development of baculovirus culture methods in collaboration with industry to optimise yield and downstream processing. 3.4 Evaluate the immunogenicity of capsids in guinea pigs and cattle."

As far as is possible within the design of the badger control policy, the purpose is to: a) monitor the effect of the intervention on bovine tuberculosis and b) identify important changes that could affect the badger control policy as early as possible. Given the pre-determined design of the control policy, this project will act as a surveillance activity rather than being hypothesis-driven research. In the first year, badger control licenses will be granted by Natural England (NE) to two pilot areas, with up to ten further areas licensed in each of the following three years. As each new area is selected, NE will share boundary location data, enabling us to identify herds located in each intervention area and its 2km ‘buffer’ region. We will first establish historical (three-years preceding intervention) bTB frequency measures in herds located within intervention areas so that changes over time can be assessed. Several bTB frequency measures will be analysed: e.g. number of new herd breakdowns per 100 herds tested, proportion of herds under movement restrictions due to a bTB breakdown etc. Secondly, as bTB incidence may change over time for reasons unrelated to intervention, areas without intervention will be selected as comparison areas. Comparison areas most similar to intervention areas in features such as historical bTB incidence, cattle demography and geographical location will be selected. This is to reduce the risk that differences in incidence between intervention and comparison areas are due to factors other than badger control. However, it will not be possible to completely remove this risk or that of random variation and therefore cautious interpretation of study results will be required. Once comparison areas have been selected, reports will be compiled for each intervention: comparison couplet describing their historical bTB incidence and other features (e.g. cattle herd demography) that may influence the interpretation of future results. Six-monthly and annual monitoring reports will examine different measures of bTB in cattle herds through simple descriptive statistics and graphs and more in-depth analyses where the effects of some factors (other than badger control) that could cause a difference between intervention and comparison areas, are adjusted for using regression techniques. Any observable change in incidence resulting from the badger cull is likely to occur slowly over time and effects may not be observed in the early years of the study. However the effect of culling is anticipated to increase over time therefore the surveillance methods developed herein should be used for longer term monitoring."

This adversely affects animal health and welfare, and is a cause of considerable economic loss to farmers and Government. Although transmission of Mycobacterium bovis between cattle is an important factor in spread of the disease, the Eurasian badger (Meles meles) represents an additional wildlife source of recurrent M. bovis infection to cattle in both the UK and Ireland. Following the recent Ministerial statement that badgers would not be culled as part of control measures for bovine TB (http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/ministers/statements/hb080707.htm), the vaccination of badgers against TB has come to the fore as a possible means to reduce and control bovine TB alongside other control measures. It has long been recognised that delivery of vaccine in oral bait holds the best prospect for vaccinating badgers over a wide geographical area and has proved highly successful for mass vaccination of other wildlife species against rabies. In the short to medium term, M. bovis Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine represents the best available option for vaccination of badgers against TB. Options for the formulation of BCG in bait will be explored under a complementary research project. This project will focus on experimental work using the oral vaccine in order to generate data for the licensing of the vaccine. There are defined steps to achieve this as follows, and each of these requirements form part of this project: • Experimental safety study on captive badgers performed to Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) accreditation. • A field safety study on wild badgers performed to Good Clinical Practice (GCP). • Demonstration of the effectiveness of the vaccine to badgers in experimental infection studies. Another important element to this project and related to the safety of the vaccine, is assessment of the likelihood and consequences of exposure of non-target species to the oral bait vaccine. EU Directive 92/18/EEC requires that the potential risk to unvaccinated animals of the target or any other potentially exposed species shall be evaluated. The Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) will be responsible for evaluating the application to obtain a National Marketing Authorisation for the oral badger vaccine. The most significant non-target species from the perspective of TB control is cattle. There is a need to quantify and determine the risks associated with exposure of cattle to the badger bait vaccine in advance of decisions over whether to vaccinate badgers orally as part of TB control policy, and make recommendations about precautions that can be taken to reduce the risk. The first element of this process will be addressed in the complementary research project, where the palatability of various candidate baits to cattle is being evaluated in a natural grazing situation using camera surveillance. In this project, we will evaluate uptake in the higher risk situation where baits are deployed at setts to which cattle have access, and then move towards an evaluation of the means of reducing this exposure risk."

This is the case for bovine tuberculosis (bTB), a disease primarily of cattle but also found in a number of wildife species; in Britain and Ireland the most important of these is the Eurasian badger (Meles meles). While Ireland has had a persistent bTB problem in cattle, by the 1970's bTB had been almost eradicated from GB but since then there has been a dramatically re-emerging disease in cattle. Bovine TB is a zoonosis with implications for both humans and animal health, though chronic cases of either in Britain and Ireland are few. Control of bTB also places a severe strain on individual farmers, the farming industry and government, with a projected cost in England & Wales alone of over £1bn over the next decade. While it has long been suspected that badgers are involved, research efforts to date have not determied the extent to which badgers are responsible for bTB in cattle. One of the most important developments in epidemiology of the last few decades has been the increased use of 'genetic fingerprinting' to identify patterns of disease spread. Until recently, this has largely been done using only a small number of selected regions in the genome. While this kind of ""genetic fingerprinting"" has been useful and shows that cattle and badgers in the same region are usually infected by the same bTB strain, the fingerprints are far from unique: many cattle and many badgers share the same type, making it impossible to determine who infected whom. In this project we will take advantage of novel technology making it feasible and affordable to sequence the entire M. bovis genome for large numbers of samples Because the bacterium occasionally makes mistakes while replicating its genome, new mutations constantly arise which are not seen using traditional fingerprinting methods but with the new technolgoy creating a much more unique and discriminatory genetic fingerprint of transmission. Using samples collected over decades from cattle and badgers in GB and NI we will sequence the genomes of hundreds of isolates to genetically track the spread of the pathogen and to test whether it is predominantly maintained in cattle, in badgers or both. The unique opportunity exploited in this proposal is the availability of extraordinarily dense sampling of cattle and badger infection together with entire life histories of individual cattle, inlciuding movement to other farms and whether it became infected with bTB at some point in its life. This creates an exceptional resource, allowing us to compare our very detailed understanding of contacts between cattle and between herds with the genetic fingerprint information. Based on this information we will use mathematical models linked directly to statistical inference methods to simulate how the infection may have spread through cattle populations in Britain and Ireland and how it may have genetically changed in the process. This will be done under various different assumptions about the multiple possible sources and mechanisms of infection. By comparing our simulated results to the actual observations (e.g. the number of infected cattle and the type of bTB they carry, etc.), we will gain unprecedented insight into the drivers for the spread of the disease and what may prevent it's current control."	"1. Quantify the spatial scale at which M. bovis circulates locally in cattle and badgers - usiing the concept of a cosical network community to organise the clade structure of thiinferred phylogeny. Characteristic spatial scoales for local cirucuation of M. bovis will be identified and a sampling strategy to capture the spatial patterns willb e determined. 2. Quantify transmission arisinig from cattle only epidemics using genetic and epidemiological data.

The aim of this consortium is to develop and test an operational modelling framework of bTB transmission and control. This project will be based on the best available evidence regarding the epidemiology of bTB, emphasizing robustness over complexity, so as to enhance the long term viability of the framework being developed. For the purposes of this project, we define the following: i) Operational: useable by appropriately trained and educated/experienced staff within the AHVLA, with capacity of further adaptation and refinement by the initiative core members or other appropriately qualified individuals or groups. ii) Modelling framework: a set of interlinked, consistently developed modeling modules that can be robustly used for addressing various policy relevant questions, at various scales. iii) Robust: scientifically sound and founded on well-tested and clearly described principles (epidemiological, mathematical, statistical, demographical and ecological, as appropriate) The initial phases of this project will emphasize the development of the framework to consider cattle-based controls, including variation in testing schedules in order to reduce spread due to cattle and/or reduce testing burden. In order to ensure forward compatability, a parallel stream of development of models to understand badger bTB infection dynamics will be undertaken, with the aim of future incorporation of approaches that consider both simultaneously."	"The overall aim of this proposal is to develop an appropriate suite of predictive models (a “modeling framework”) for bTB transmission and control across multiple scales relevant to disease control in GB. Upon completion, this framework will primarily be used by AHVLA epidemiologists, to inform and support policy development and policy impact assessment. This aim has four underlying themes: 1. to integrate our understanding of existing models of bTB transmission in cattle and badgers, into a consistently parameterized framework, where these are appropriate to our objectives, 2. based on identified gaps in the available approaches, to develop new models where knowledge is sufficient, 3. to advise on the potential vulnerabilities in model prediction, including socio-economic and behavioural contexts, and 4. to advise on new research that may need to be commissioned, in order to fill gaps in knowledge and/or advise where modeling approaches may be inappropriate. These tasks will be embedded in the development of the operational framework to inform policy development support by AHVLA staff. These models will be based on sound epidemiological modeling principles with an emphasis on scientific and technical robustness. The easiest route to informing policy would be a predictive model for the control of bTB with a high level of granularity that explicitly includes local information and explicit cattle and badgers at the individual-animal level. Such an approach would have the advantage of being able to consider the full complexities of all likely disease control scenarios. While various models, both peer reviewed and in development or unpublished, incorporate some of these elements, to our knowledge, a robustly parameterised model including all these elements does not exist. Many data needed for such an approach are not available. Further, it is our view that even were perfect data to exist, a scientifically robust model of this type is likely to be beyond the scope of current approaches and therefore also beyond the remit of this group. We note that as the demands on model outputs change (short term, medium term and long term predictability) appropriate caution will have to be exercised in the interpretation of outputs. In particular, longer term considerations of the extent and severity of the bTB epidemic can only be viewed as, at best, qualitative indicators, due to the uncertainties in the badger-cattle interaction, and the impact that human behavior will have on the outcome. Our specific Objectives include: O.1. Development of within-herd model of bTB in cattle. O.2 Development of between-herd models. O.2.a. Historical models. O.2.b. Predictive models. O.3 Development of local badger models. O.3.a Historical models. O.3.b Predictive models."

Some of these arboviruses, such as bluetongue virus (BTV) are spread by biting midges, have a proven track record of incursion and economic impact in the UK. Others, such as Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) are spread by mosquitoes and have not entered the UK, but could have significant economic consequences for agriculture and trade if they did so. Early detection and implementation of control methods are critical in eliminating such a disease outbreak as part of Defra strategy for dealing with exotic and notifiable diseases (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/great-britain-and-northern-ireland-continency-plan-for-exotic-notifiable-diseases-of-animals). In order to meet the threat of emerging arboviruses through provision of diagnostic assays and datasets to support policy decision making, Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) and The Pirbright Insititute (TPI) are coordinating research activities in this subject area. This project aims to integrate the work of both Institutes to improve prediction, detection and control of arbovirus incursions in the UK. We have selected three key areas in which a lack of scientific evidence would currently limit decision making or which provide key capacity retention in skills relevent to this area. Firstly, we will improve front line diagnostic assays for RVFV and conduct field studies of potential UK vector mosquitoes that will inform risk assessments of incursion and spread. RVFV is an economically important zoonotic arbovirus that has been identified as a potential threat to the UK and robust detection methods are required in the event of incursion into Europe. Secondly, we will carry out field studies of Culicoides biting midges to define behaviour during the summer and winter periods and to accurately quantify the number of generations completed by species during the summer for the first time. These parameters are key components in models defining the extent and speed of spread and are broadly applicable to all Culicoides-borne viruses (e.g. BTV; African horse sickness virus; Epizootic Haemorhagic disease virus). Thirdly, in order to model arbovirus transmission we will use a specifically chosen virus (bovine ephemeral fever virus: BEFV) to carry out a joint exercise in determining vectors through artificial feeding experiments and an animal experiment. We have chosen BEFV because its primary vectors remain uncertain (having been narrowed to either biting midges or mosquitoes), it is known to be present on the fringes of Europe and no current vaccine is available. The primary aim of the objective is for APHA and TPI to combine expertise and resources to define the process of arbovirus transmission under UK conditions and in doing so to enhance the skill sets available to both parties and hence UK capability."

Bats have very broad geographic ranges and variable contacts with domestic animals and humans. The identified reservoir bat species of henipaviruses are known to feed on commercial food crops, as well as the bats themselves being a food source for humans. An outbreak of Nipah virus in Malaysia in 1998 resulted in the culling of over one million pigs and the deaths of over 100 people. This virus has since caused multiple outbreaks with human-to-human transmission in Bangladesh and India. In 2011 there were more Hendra virus cases in horses in Australia than all the previous years combined. A five year research project, ANTIGONE (ANTIcipating the Global Onset of Novel Epidemics) has been part-funded by the European Commission. The project started in November 2011 and is due to finish in November 2016. As part of this project the AHVLA will be developing a risk assessment model for the introduction of bat-borne zoonotic viruses into the European Union (EU). We will develop a generic risk assessment framework that will consider the possible routes of introduction of bat-borne zoonotic viruses with pandemic potential into the EU. Viruses to be considered will include: Nipah virus, Ebola and Marburg viruses (which have shown their pandemic potential in multiple spillovers from animal to human populations, with subsequent spread and high mortality in people) and SARS-like coronaviruses (in 2003 SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) was a dramatic example of how quickly a zoonotic virus can spread around the world). Routes considered will include; human travel, fruit imports, pig imports and illegal bushmeat trade. This work will build upon previous Defra funded and published work at the AHVLA on developing a UK henipavirus risk assessment. This generic framework will be used as the basis for a more in-depth assessment of specific case studies (i.e. to assess the risk of a specific virus being introduced into an individual MS or region). These case studies will, where appropriate, use quantitative modelling techniques to incorporate variability and/or uncertainty about variables such as the volume of trade of a particular item (e.g. bushmeat) and the amount of virus excreted by infected animals. In addition, a spatial risk assessment, based on susceptible population densities, will be linked to the case study assessments, to inform risk-based surveillance and identify disease emergence “hot spots”. It is intended that some of the other workpackages within ANTIGONE will generate relevant data to inform the case studies, such as quantification of the survival of Nipah virus in food products and provision of data on presence and prevalence of Nipah virus and other bat-borne zoonoses in European bats. We anticipate that these methods could be applied to other exotic diseases in the future and may complement current disease prioritisation tools to provide a more in-depth assessment where data (and time) are available and contribute to the development of more effective and timely prevention and control measures."
