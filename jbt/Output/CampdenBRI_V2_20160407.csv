"123466"	"Vitamin D fortification of foods"	"2011"	"2014"	"Vitamin D is the term used to describe two molecules, ergocalciferol (vitamin D2, derived by UV irradiation of the ergosterol that is widely distributed in plants and other fungi) and cholecalciferol (vitamin D3, formed from the action of UV irradiation on the skin). Poor vitamin D status is a very common problem in the UK. This has important health consequences (such as muscle/bone function, increasing the risk of diabetes). This project is directly comparing the biological effects of vitamin D2 vs. vitamin D3 in fortified foods of different matrices (i.e. a solid vs. liquid food) using a dose of vitamin D that is realistic and relevant to the food industry (600IU/15µg per day). It will examine responses in Caucasians and South Asians, and explore 'systems' level (genetic/enzymatic) differences in potential responses to vitamin D fortification.

"124487"	"Novel processing of flour and starch"	"2011"	"2015"	"The functionality of wheat flour is determined by its physical properties and chemical composition. For example, swelling power and gelatinization temperature of wheat flour are highly dependent on the content and composition of components associated with starch such as proteins and lipids. Wheat flour is used as an ingredient in a multitude of food products such as breads, biscuits, cakes, batters, soups, sauces and coatings. While flour milling (the primary process) may be considered a mature technology, there has been less focus on developing secondary processing technologies to modify the functionality of flour (with the exception of heat treatment). Instead, processors tend to rely on the addition of ingredients and additives. The objective of this study is to gain a deeper understanding of the potential to modify flour functionality through modification of the base chemistry. The initial focus will be on selective modification of the lipid profile of flours. A second focus will be to modify the starch properties of flour. Studying these areas in more detail in a range of baked products will complement the already well developed understanding of the role of proteins in flour quality and functionality.

There is scope for developing new products to appeal to consumer interest in healthy products by using cereals other than wheat and introducing products other than bread. Of particular interest are oats, barley and pseudocereals (such as buckwheat). Soluble fibres (e.g. arabinoxylose, ß-glucan or inulin) provide an alternative to cellulose-rich wheat bran and introduce a different set of challenges for processing. These fibres are light in colour and may be more acceptable to consumers. Considerable academic research has been carried out into the use of pre-treatments to reduce the negative impact of fibre addition on bread quality. The feasibility of applying these techniques in plant bakeries will be evaluated in this work. "	"fred.gates@campdenbri.co.uk"	"Gates, Fred"	"44(0)1386 842093"	"437"	"-1"	"139"	"437"
"131992"	"Food authenticity - development of 'next generation' analytical technologies to protect the food industry from fraud"	"2014"	"2016"	"Following the recent issues with horse DNA found in meat products, there is increasing concern and interest in all parts of the industry regarding the authenticity and adulteration of foods and raw materials. This follows previous concerns regarding adulteration of milk with melamine and addition of illegal dyes to spices. The concern goes beyond the specific issue of the origin of meat and has been identified as one of the most important issues globally concerning food and drink. Recent events have highlighted the need for member companies to have a resource to help them tackle authenticity issues, and to help them identify suitable modern analytical approaches to verify claims made on packaging and to confirm the identity of raw materials. Non-targeted screening methods are being sought by the food industry since these are not generally available.

Gluten sensitivity is distinct from coeliac disease and is estimated to affect a sizeable proportion of the overall population (6-10%); it represents a significant market opportunity both at home and overseas. Because certain wheat proteins are more important in creating the texture of bread, while others are believed to be linked to gluten sensitivity, it is speculated that wheat bread can be made to be suitable for those sensitive to gluten by the removal of certain proteins from wheat using novel approaches. Bread made from wheat is expected to be more comparable to standard bread and to be preferable to GF bread. This work will be developed through a joint programme involving Warburtons and DSM, using approaches based on advanced enzyme technology, ingredient formulation and bakery processing in order to achieve the selective removal of wheat protein types. The Rowett Institute is a further member of the consortium and will seek to work with gluten sensitive volunteers to establish whether treatments are beneficial and desirable to them.

"134925"	"An ingredient functionality approach to shelf-life extension of foods"	"2015"	"2017"	"Baked products and other starch-based foods undergo undesirable changes after production that result in changes in their physical or textural properties. This can lead to increased firmness of products such as bread and cakes, as well as syneresis in chilled dairy products and sauces. The result is loss in eating quality and the products being considered unfit for purpose and discarded. This is a wasteful process, not just in terms of the raw materials used, but also in the energy spent on manufacturing the product in the first place. Extension of shelf-life has a considerable economic advantage. Changes in starch are considered to be responsible for firming and other changes in bread crumb during storage. This can vary depending on the starch types used. Storage temperature is also important, particularly for chill storage, where recrystallisation of starches can lead to a rapid increase in firmness and also in the amount of water separation in chilled ready meals containing starch-based sauces. This project will focus on the functionality and interaction of starches with other flour components and ingredients in a range of products, in order to get a better understanding of factors leading to staling, and develop strategies to counter these changes.

"2011"	"2014"	"Pasteurisation requirements for acid or acidified food products are clearly defined in many guidelines and can be delivered 'in-pack' or to products that are heat processed before being clean/aseptically filled. Many are hot filled as ready-to-eat (RTE) products and it has always been assumed that the hot fill process will give the packaging and closures a sufficient thermal process to reduce any microbial hazards present. However, no guidance exists and the uncertainty has meant that foods are either processed to a higher temperature than necessary before filling, or the product is given a further heat treatment after filling. Quantifying the heat treatment given to food packages during hot-fill operations would potentially increase line efficiency and reduce waste, reduce energy input, reduce water usage and reduce the environmental burdens of food manufacturing. There are key scientific challenges for this project, including understanding the heat transfer and fluid flow issues and development of methods to evaluate process adequacy and effectiveness at the food-package interface. Commercially, the project applies to several package formats: glass (e.g. jars and bottles), plastic (e.g. pots, bags, pouches, cartons and trays), card (e.g. soups and sauces) and metallised film (e.g. pouches and bags).

The project will to develop a practical method of superchilling food that has the widest possible application to the food industry. This method will be developed to deliver optimum product quality whilst retaining product safety and increasing longevity. The longevity of the product will be limited by the growth of psychrotrophic microorganisms, and so both the standard and psychrotrophic spoilage microflora will be monitored to aid the assignation of an appropriate shelf life.

Further research in Japan, using nano-scale bubbles in water, has also shown potential for practical improvements in cleaning. There is great potential for the use of this technology. Microbial contamination or soiling that is firmly attached to a surface will require some chemical treatment following by spraying. The addition of abrasion by adding particles to the water is not practical due to the need for additional waste water treatment and particle recovery. Modifying the properties of the water by introducing air into the liquid provides the additional cleaning forces. Tension at the surface of each bubble resists forces applied to the bubble and it is this action that leads to an additional cleaning effect of the water/air mixture.

It can also have beneficial effects for food product development. For example, antioxidants are often added to fat-containing foods to delay or slow down the development of rancidity. Greater retention of naturally present or added antioxidants through optimal thermal processing can improve product shelf life. Optimised thermal process could also reduce cost and energy consumption. CTemp modelling has been proven to be an effective means of thermal safety validation. TTIs are also very successful in validation of thermal process safety and are now widely used in thermal process validation where conventional temperature probes cannot be used.

Outcomes from this research will provide general guidance on various packaging design elements and the likelihood of consumers perceiving them as being healthy.

The UK has an annual incidence of 321,000 infections, costing more than £500 million. More than 80% of retail chicken caracses in the UK are contaminated, so investigation into survival of C. jejuni in the food chain is important. Biofilms are thought to conribute to survival, with bacterial shedding from the biofilm allowing cross-contamination of foodstuffs. To study the role of biofilms in food relevant conditions, a model system is being utilised, based on juice collected from chicken meat.

"128882"	"Effective low aw food and environment decontamination technologies"	"2013"	"2015"	"For many years, low moisture foods such as chocolate, seeds, nuts, cereals, spices or flour were regarded as microbiologically safe due to their inherent product characteristics. Due to the high heat resistance of microorganisms in low a w foods, there is growing concern for the potential presence and survival of Enterobacteriaceae ( Salmonella, Escherichia coli, Cronobacter ) through the decontamination steps and the processing environments used for these products. This is a significant problem within the food industry which can cause enormous losses to manufacturers and risks the health of consumers. This project will evaluate, validate and improve the decontamination technologies used for low a w foods whilst building on the information derived from the current MSFR project on Salmonella . Critical control points, operational prerequisites and Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) will also be considered.

The optimum will be based on the effectiveness of the gas mixes for reducing the numbers of Campylobacter , and the effects on aerobic plate counts, numbers of Pseudomonas , and the drip, colour, rancidity and odour. The gas mixes will include combinations of one or more of the gases O 2 , CO 2 , and N 2 . To achieve this goal, the project has four main parts: (a) assess the effects of gas mixes that are currently used commercially, (b) identify improved gas mixes that lead to a more rapid reduction in Campylobacter and also measure the effects on the other factors, (c) full scale commercial trial of the improved mix including the chain from slaughterhouse to retail, and (d) measure the effects of overwrapping versus sealed packs on Campylobacter counts, compare aerobic plate counts after 20 or 30°C incubation, and measure in-pack gas:meat ratios and variations in Campylobacter counts around carcass surfaces (top vs bottom). The project consortium includes researchers, a gas supplier, a packaging machinery manufacturer, two poultry processors, and two retailers.

"131202"	"Mung bean disinfection using cold atmospheric plasma - a feasibility study"	"2013"	"2014"	"The consumption of raw sprouted seeds and beans has led to a large number of food poisoning outbreaks in many different countries. Outbreaks can occur on an international scale with contaminated seeds from one country being distributed to many different countries for sprouting. Considerable research has focused on new decontamination methods for pathogens on seeds for sprouting. Whilst some of these techniques have shown promise for microbial decontamination, they have proved to be highly variable in their efficacy. The treatment of seeds for sprouting requires a careful balance between decontaminating the pathogenic species whilst not affecting the germination of the seed. Washing with water or chemicals, such as chlorine, are treatments that have been investigated with limited consistency. This project will investigate cold atmospheric plasma, a technique to generate an abundance of highly reactive oxygen species for the disinfection of Salmonella species on mung beans. Plasma impacts on seed germination as well as quality parameters (colour and texture) of sprouted seeds will be investigated using conditions that demonstrate effective disinfection.

"131998"	"Intelligent process and product design using new predictive tools"	"2014"	"2016"	"The food industry faces the combined challenge of extending product shelf life whilst reducing the preservation factors that control pathogens and spoilage organisms. One potential approach to achieve these goals is to develop products that use a combination of control factors. Product shelf life and stability are often evaluated using microbial predictive models, which give an indication of the impact of preservation factors and process measures on microbial survival. However, these models have a number of limitations: overestimating the potential effects of reformulation; the number and combinations of preservation factors that can be included in a single search; and the need for microbial growth to predict survival and potential for growth. The project will explore the use of molecular markers as novel tools that have the potential ability to enhance the prediction process using a holistic approach which is capable of evaluating multiple factors simultaneously. These unique tools will enable industry to determine the potential lethality of production processes and product composition, in an efficient and unbiased way.

Although guidance states that food businesses should not rely solely on results of allergen testing to make this decision, analysis remains an integral part of allergen management. It is important therefore that food businesses have confidence in the results of allergen tests. This project will provide information to engender confidence in analytical results to aid with decisions based on food allergen action levels. In addition, in 2014 the food information regulation will supersede current allergen labelling legislation. One of the fundamental changes is the introduction of the requirement to provide information on the allergen content of foods sold loose and in catering situations. This project will also support catering establishments by providing guidance and training on management of food allergens.

Epidemiological data shows that norovirus (NoV) is a large cause of infectious intestinal disease throughout the world. Over the last 10 years there has been a significant increase in the number of reported cases in England and Wales, with nearly 11,000 recorded in 2012. The route of NoV infection is known to be through either person-to-person spread or the consumption of contaminated food, although the percentage contribution of these two vectors in outbreaks is not always proven. Evidence has shown, however, that large outbreaks of NoV have occurred due to contaminated foods (e.g. raspberries, strawberries). The control of food borne viruses is a growing area of concern for the industry, and at present there is limited information available of direct relevance to foods. Of particular importance is the understanding of the survival and persistence of food borne viruses on foods and in the environment, as well as the assessment/validation of antimicrobial treatments.

It is feared that this situation will continue and with global warming, more droughts are expected over the next years whilst the essential demand for water by industry, agriculture and the public increases year-on-year. As a result, in some parts of the country, water companies are restricting their supply of public water to the food industry. Use of non-potable water is an alternative to the use or reuse of precious potable water. One of the problems with this is that the risks associated with using such water need to be assessed. So far, there is no guidance on the possible uses of non-potable water, including on how to treat the water to prepare it for its intended use. The study will build on the risk assessment approach established in Guideline 70, Guidelines on the reuse of potable water for food processing operations (2012) .

The hazards and risks are not static and factors such as changes in legislation, products, processes and new knowledge all have an influence. Similarly food safety management systems continue to evolve and adapt to meet the new challenges. These systems need to be efficient and effective in managing food safety and existing good practice has to incorporate new knowledge and thinking on the establishment, implementation and maintenance of food safety systems. However, it is increasingly recognised that there should be a more holistic approach to food and feed safety management since the benefit of an integrated approach can be said to be greater than the sum of the components. This proposal therefore focuses on elucidating and incorporating new approaches and practices and exemplifying how an integrated approach to safety management can be achieved.

"134933"	"Development of a risk model to determine an appropriate level of due diligence testing for raw material and final product authenticity"	"2015"	"2016"	"Risk Assessment is widely used by the food industry. Although it may work well for microbiological hazards, many sectors of the food industry do not understand the concept of risk in relation to other hazards such as chemical hazards or allergen management. In addition to requirements to perform risk assessment defined by industry and legislative standards, it could be a useful tool to help companies develop testing schedules as part of their quality assurance schemes. Analytical testing of products or raw materials is an expensive part of a company's QA scheme. The requirement to include checks for raw material and product authenticity has become important. A systematic approach using a risk model could be used to estimate the amount of testing required based on knowledge gleaned from food safety management, TACCP, horizon scanning or gap analysis exercises. This project will review risk assessment practices used by other industries, and use this knowledge to produce a new Guideline document or update Guideline 65 ('Risk Assessment and Management of Raw Materials').Guideline documentation will include suitable guidance for companies to allow them to develop testing schemes based on HACCP, TACCP, horizon scanning, gap analysis or legislative requirements.

Non-microbiological particles that can cause haze include starch, beta-glucan, proteins, lipids and crystalline substances. Controlling hazes first requires collection and analysis of the haze-causing material; this enables the cause of the haze to be identified and corrective actions can then be taken. This project will assess and develop methods for measuring and characterising hazes in beers with novel ingredients and other novel alcoholic beverages such as beer mixes (e.g. radlers), cider/fruit mixes and spirits with novel additives. Foam is another factor of importance in the drinks industry. Excess foam during production and processing can cause serious problems; for some drinks fobbing at bottling can produce particular problems. Yet some drinks require good foam formation on dispense. This project will investigate the causes of foaming in various drinks and assess ways of understanding the mechanisms involved in foam formation/stability as well as investigating options for controlling and, where required, enhancing foam.

The inherent microbiological stability of drinks varies greatly and it is vital for both product quality and food safety that correct preservation techniques are applied during manufacture. To this end pasteurisation is commonly used in the drinks industry, the effect of which is measured in Pasteurisation Units (PUs). It is important to optimise PUs so that sufficient microbial stability can be obtained without incurring excessive costs or deleterious effects on flavour. This project will investigate the effect of different pasteurisation timings and temperatures on the microbial stability of a range of novel drinks. In some cases, commercial drinks will be inoculated with microorganisms that may be expected to occur in them. In other cases model systems will be used to assess the effects of pH, alcohol content, sugar concentration, etc in maintaining microbial stability.

"4302"	"Benchmarking energy and water use at individual steps of the brewing processes"	"2014"	"2014"	"Campden BRI has previously been involved in benchmarking energy and water use in breweries. Participation was restricted to breweries producing more than 0.5 million hectolitres and producing predominantly lager. The study in 2012 showed that best practice for energy use was 141 MJ / Hl of beer and for water use was 3.3 Hl / Hl beer. This data enables brewers to compare the performance of their own brewery with that of the 250 other breweries taking part. However, there is a disadvantage to the current studies since they compare total energy and water use and do not take account of the individual process steps involved; hence breweries producing keg beer only may be compared with those producing bottled and canned beer. Hence it is difficult for brewers to identify the individual process steps where energy or water use is higher than the average and where actions need to be taken to reduce consumption and lower costs. This project will investigate energy and water consumption at individual process steps. Initially the study will focus on two resource intensive processes: Wort boiling and cleaning and disinfection of fermenter vessels after use. The studies will enable brewers to identify if their processes are efficient in comparison with brewers of similar scale and technology base. Are there opportunities for improvement? At time of writing we are collecting questionnaires from brewers that will provide the answers. "	"gary.freeman@campdenbri.co.uk"	"Freeman, Gary"	"44(0)1737 824278"	"437"	"-1"	"139"	"437"
