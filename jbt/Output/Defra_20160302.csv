The programme unites efforts of experienced avian immunologists, pathogen specialists and gut flora microbiologists, forming a trans-EU team of scientists to address the complex interactions between the chicken and its microbial environment. The proposed programme of work will deliver a combination of high quality fundamental research and practical outcomes, defining a new framework for selecting pro-biotic formulations to accelerate immune development, improve poultry gut health and reduce pathogen carriage. Specifically, we will determine the effects of pro-biotic formulations of differing complexity on the development of immune capability and the outcome of infection. We will also determine the effects on colonisation, persistence and transmission of Campylobacter and Salmonella. The studies will employ pro-biotic formulations under a variety of conditions to define how these interactions affect pathogen dynamics. We will determine the effects of microflora on development of the chicken intestinal immune system and the reciprocal impact of immunity on the microflora. Similarly, we will define the interactions between natural gut microflora, pro-biotic formulations, housing, chicken strain and infection dynamics. Each of these areas will involve application of established and new methods to determine changes in the immune system, the gut flora and disease transmission dynamics. These analyses will be supported by in vitro approaches to determine the microbial recognition events within the bird (such as those mediated by the avian Pattern Recognition Receptor system). One important anticipated outcome of this work will be to develop a new set of selection criteria for identifying components of defined pro-biotic formulations that can be used to promote the health of poultry and reduce the impact of infections that are pathogenic to poultry or transmitted from poultry to humans. We also expect to discover new pro-biotic components, formulations and delivery criteria that will maximise the impact of these sustainable interventions. Delivery of these outcomes is supported by the within programme links to industry and by employing the experienced technology transfer teams at each institution. In addition to the scientific and practical solutions for the industry the DIFAGH programme will also be a focus for recruitment and training of future generations of researchers in this field."

GMI was established in 2011 with the vision to develop the potential of breakthrough sequencing technologies for the field of infectious diseases through a joint research and development agenda, with applications in clinical and public health laboratories across the world. In order to achieve that long-term goal, the GMI group aims to promote development and deployment of novel applications, data sharing and analysis systems across the diversity of pathogens, domains and sectors. The COMPARE project is set up to put this vision into action in Europe, addressing the following main objective: • TO IMPROVE RAPID IDENTIFICATION, CONTAINMENT AND MITIGATION OF EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND FOODBORNE OUTBREAKS, • BY DEVELOPING A CROSS-SECTOR AND CROSS-PATHOGEN ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK AND GLOBALLY LINKED DATA AND INFORMATION SHARING PLATFORM, • THAT INTEGRATES STATE-OF-THE-ART STRATEGIES, TOOLS, TECHNOLOGIES AND METHODS FOR COLLECTING, PROCESSING AND ANALYZING SEQUENCE-BASED PATHOGEN DATA IN COMBINATION WITH ASSOCIATED (CLINICAL, EPIDEMIOLOGICAL AND OTHER) DATA, • FOR THE GENERATION OF ACTIONABLE INFORMATION TO RELEVANT AUTHORITIES AND OTHER USERS IN THE HUMAN HEALTH, ANIMAL HEALTH AND FOOD SAFETY DOMAINS; Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) used for Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) or Whole Community Sequencing (WCS or metagenomics) are opening and dominating a new field of data generation and connection, revolutionizing pathogen detection and typing in human and animal health just as much as in food science. These technologies are rapidly dropping in cost and starting to become in reach of routine clinical and public health laboratories (Köser et al. 2012, Didelot et al. 2012). NGS/WGS/WCS enables generating the complete genomic information from the isolate or sample independent of both the sector (public health, veterinary health, food safety), and the type of pathogen (viruses, bacteria, parasites). The outputs (sequence data) provide one common language that can be exchanged and compared between laboratories and over time, in combination with other associated data defined here as “metadata” including contextual data (e.g. data on sample type and process, clinical, microbiological, epidemiological and other data) primary data (raw sequence reads) and derived data (e.g., genomic alignments of reads, assemblies and functional annotation data sets). COMPARE aims to harness the rapid advances in these technologies to improve identification, and mitigation of emerging infectious diseases and foodborne outbreaks. To this purpose COMPARE will establish a “One serves all” analytical framework and data exchange platform that will allow real time analysis and interpretation of sequence-based pathogen data in combination with associated data. Figure 1: Genomic Information as the pathogen independent language across locations, sectors and time COMPARE 3 In order to achieve this, COMPARE will pursue specific objectives A through G, to be realized within the fiveyear duration of COMPARE. Together these 7 project objectives shape the overall structure of COMPARE – as depicted in figure 2 – showing the different components of the COMPARE Analytical Framework. The project follows a common trajectory necessary to obtain high quality information for stakeholders to improve rapid identification, containment and mitigation of emerging infectious diseases and foodborne outbreaks. A. Starting from the design of risk-assessment models and risk-based sampling and data collection strategies that enhance our capacity to detect potential disease outbreaks; B. From samples and associated metadata to comparable data: The process to obtain high quality and comparable sequence data from and metadata associated with a specimen; C. From comparable data to actionable information: The downstream analyses involved in turning comparable data into actionable information for addressing questions in frontline diagnostics, food-borne infections and (re-) emerging infections. “Actionable Information” is defined as information that enables users generating/receiving this information to take well-informed decisions and actions in pursuit of: • Pathogen identification and characterization: Pathogen identification, genotyping and phenotyping, (e.g., detection of relevant antimicrobial resistance, virulence, epidemiological markers); • Outbreak detection: Detection of putative clusters by examining strain-specific clusters in time, place and host (person, animal and food); • Outbreak investigation: Rapid interrogation for given molecular strains to identify the potential origin of internationally distributed clones that may result in outbreaks; analysis tools to monitor extend of spread based on sequence diversity in relation to control measures; • Outbreak prediction: Automatic analyses for predicting risk of emergence of pathogens with outbreak potential. D. Researchers focusing on these steps team up with system developers that will build a data and information platform supporting rapid sharing, integration and analysis of sequence-based pathogen data in combination with other contextual metadata; FIGURE 2: the COMPARE analytical framework and its main components from sample and data collection to generating actionable information to stakeholders in the human, animal and food sectors. COMPARE 4 E. Risk communication tools will be developed enabling authorities in the human and animal health and food safety sectors to effectively communicate to their stakeholders results obtained with the new analytical workflows; F. The development of the analytical framework is underpinned by a set of supporting research, dissemination and communication activities promoting the acceptance of the system and its components. These activities encompass (i) consultations with our stakeholders serving on expert advisory panels throughout the project to maintain a prominent focus on user needs (ii) studies on the barriers (ethical, regulatory, administrative, logistical, political) to the implementation and widespread use of open-date sharing platforms, (iii) dissemination and training activities; G. Finally COMPARE will include the development of a framework for estimating the cost-effectiveness of the COMPARE system, including the value of safety."

Maintaining a representative collection of well characterised field and reference Salmonella enterica isolates fulfils the need to conserve reference strains for quality control, development of new typing schemes and source that provides a historic context for prospective studies aimed at understanding this important zoonotic pathogen. Furthermore, the application of new low-cost high-throughput technological approaches to study archived strain collections provides the opportunity to retrospectively analyse old collections providing fresh insights into the epidemiology, transmission and disease patterns. A case in point is the opportunity provided by the emergence of next-generation sequencing technology that has in the last few years made whole genome sequencing (WGS) of thousands of bacterial isolates financially viable. In collaboration between the APHA, the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (WTSI) and PHE, we propose to take a methodical approach to evaluate the potential for retrospective analysis of the APHA Salmonella strain collection. The isolates span over 20 years and the majority are of serotypes that have zoonotic potential. Thus investigating this collection in detail will provide data and context relevant not only to animal health, but also human health. The massive strain collection and related epidemiological and spatio-temporal data will be scrutinised using statistical, Bayesian and phylogenetic methods which will then be used to inform selection of strains for comparative WGS to investigate the genetic properties of key Salmonella strains that are associated with their emergence and decline within certain livestock sectors and environmental niches. DNA based methods have been recommended to replace serotyping for strain discrimination. Sequencing a comprehensive background collection of Salmonella isolates of different serovars will facilitate the development of MLST typing scheme for routine use at APHA, which supplemented by even more discriminatory sequence-based typing methods based on entire genomes will increase strain discrimination and provide a clearer picture of long-term transmission. The proposed study will provide: (1) Context for future control programmes and potentially identify genetic markers for low- cost surveillance tests to identify potentially significant new strains at an early stage. (2) This work will generate algorithms, validated by the sequence data that can be used to select representative strains, allowing a rationalisation of current strain storage and consequent cost savings for selection of representative strains from future surveillance. (3) Work on the genetic stability of strains during different storage conditions will lead to optimisation of long-term storage and maintenance of strains in a manner that minimises losses in viability and genetic change making them more valuable to Government and commercial interests for future work. (4) The findings will also feed into Defra components of future EFSA/ECDC initiatives on molecular typing of zoonotic pathogens, particularly in replacement of the reference laboratory serotyping of Salmonella spp. with WGS based typing by defining MLST derived clonal complexes and replacement of the current reference laboratory methods such as phage typing and MLVA/PFGE with SNP based phylogenies for strain resolution."

This has been in place since 1985 and is of great economic value to the nation. To maintain freedom of disease the nation must rapidly identify and then resolve outbreaks of disease. This may occur via re-importation of infected animals or even re-emergence from an environmental source. The aim of this project is to improve the tools available to detect, trace and eradicate any reintroduction of disease as well as to better facilitate the efficient maintenance of disease free status. This project aims to improve the specificity of immunological assays for the indirect detection of brucellosis in livestock. The currently available tests are vulnerable to cross reactions due to infection with some non-Brucella organisms. The aim is to improve specificity through the design, synthesis and application of cutting edge oligosaccharide antigens which contain only the unique structural elements of the dominant Brucella antigen. The native antigen contains these epitopes within polymers which also contain common epitopes. The project also supports the production, purification and investigation of other abundant surface antigens, such as the rough lipopolysaccharide, that we will derive from Brucella culture. Direct detection methods have potentially greater specificity than immunological tests. The challenge is that Brucella occurs at very low levels in accessible clinical material such as milk and blood. Therefore a means to improve the direct detection of Brucella DNA will be developed and evaluated. This method will combine two powerful techniques, immuno-capture and Real Time PCR, to increase the concentration of target DNA in biological samples in a manner compatible with specific application by PCR. Anti-Brucella antibodies will be coupled to small magnetic beads which will be dispersed and incubated within biological samples. Any Brucella cells present in the samples will specifically bind to the antibodies on the beads. These beads can be concentrated and washed with the aid of magnets such that any captured Brucella cells remain surface bound. The cells, and their DNA, can then be delivered to the PCR reaction. The third challenge to be addressed is to improve the means by which outbreaks of disease can be traced back to source. Traditional classification methods have very low ability to differentiate strains from the same Brucella species and biovar. DNA based molecular methods have greatly improved resolving and identification capability. However, the DNA of different strains of Brucella frequently have such similar DNA sequences that even these methods lack power. This project will combine whole genome sequencing and bioinformatics tools to maximise the ability to differentiate between strains of Brucella. Working with samples from the APHA archive and sourced from international partners we shall construct a database of whole genome sequences such that the ability to identify the source of any disease outbreaks is improved."

"SE0426"	"Optimisation of current diagnostic capabilities and restrictions to vaccine efficacy for the lyssaviruses"	"http://randd.defra.gov.uk//Default.aspx?Menu=Menu&Module=More&Location=None&Completed=2&ProjectID=16539#Description"	"2011"	"2016"	"All lyssaviruses, including rabies virus (RABV) constitute a public health threat that continues to be of great significance to the UK and European Union. Historically, rabies posed a significant public health threat across the EU. Whilst extensive wildlife vaccination campaigns across Western Europe appear to have eliminated terrestrial rabies, lyssaviruses still circulate within volant wildlife populations. Furthermore, RABV remains endemic across parts of Eastern Europe in terrestrial vectors. Currently, the main threat to public health in the UK and Western Europe appears to be through human interaction with bats, whilst terrestrial reservoirs such as foxes and raccoon dogs still constitute a threat across Eastern Europe. Of note, within the UK, European bat lyssaviruses type-2 (EBLV-2), remains endemic in one indigenous insectivorous bat species (Daubenton's bats) and was responsible for the death of a bat conservationist in Scotland in 2002. The continual isolation of EBLV-2 and related lyssavirus species within the EU drives interest in these significant pathogens. Importantly, whilst the UK retains a rabies-free status, the risk of importation remains and preparedness against incursion of virus into the UK, is key to maintain this status. The current armoury of reactionary diagnostic procedures available require enhancement to enable rapid scaling-up, should an outbreak of rabies occur in the UK. We will do this through enhanced collaboration with groups in rabies endemic regions. To this end, we propose to enhance both our current field based and molecular capacity for diagnosis of lyssaviruses. This work will centre on development of novel field based and lab based technologies to be used as front-line tests in the event of an outbreak in the UK. Key to maintaining the UK rabies-free status, is understanding the presence of EBLV-2 within indigenous bat populations. Restrictions to lyssavirus spill-over and maintenance between host species are poorly understood. Lyssavirus strains can differ significantly in their ability to invade the CNS of a new host, and virus adaptation to the reservoir host species is a key factor. The successful maintenance of a newly introduced lyssavirus within a naive UK mammal population, or their transmission to victims (e.g. humans), is most probably associated with neuroinvasiveness and cell tropism rather than viral load. This project seeks to address research questions regarding potential for species-to-species transmission through assessment of cell susceptability to different lyssaviruses. Further to this, through mutagenesis of lyssavirus G proteins we wish to identify potential epitopes of significance to vaccine protection for this group of highly divergent zoonotic viruses. Overall, this final aspect of the project functions to bridge applied scientific studies with research objectives to increase our understanding of these important zoonotic agents."	"1 – Enhancement of current molecular technologies for the laboratory based diagnosis of lyssavirus infection. We aim to standardise and validate RNA extraction methodologies; enhance the nested RT-PCR assay; optimise the real time RT-PCR assay and; develop in house expertise with a novel serological pseudotype assay (developed through SE0423). These activities will involve continued collaboration with established research partners and OIE labs to enable testing of extensive panels of both RNA and sera. Optimisation of both the standard and real time RT-PCR assays will drive the development of them for use in the event of a UK outbreak. Further development of the pseudotype assay will involve increased collaboration with UCL, FLI and CDC. 2 – Validation of field sampling techniques to enable high throughput of diagnostic specimens in the event of a rabies virus introduction to the UK. A recent table top exercise on the ability of the UK to respond to an outbreak of rabies has identified the submission of large numbers of carcasses or animal heads to high containment laboratories for brain removal during an outbreak situation, as a key logistical constraint on testing capacity. We wish to develop, enhance and validate techniques to harvest appropriate material in the field, using modern mechanisms for sample collection to greatly reduce individual sample bulk size following submission and reduce costs and bio-safety risks. This validation can only be undertaken by making the most of existing collaborations with colleagues in rabies endemic areas, where larger numbers of positive animals are available to sample. Furthermore, we also wish to test novel diagnostic platforms that require optimisation and validation before being considered as rapid field based alternatives to current molecular techniques. To this end we wish to further develop immunodiagnostic technology in collaboration with our close collaborators at FLI, Germany. 3 - Lyssavirus cell susceptibility and correlates of protection against the lyssaviruses European Bat Lyssavirus type-2 (EBLV-2) is maintained in UK bat populations. However, virus transmission and maintenance within bat populations remains an enigma. ‘Spill over’ events from bats to other terrestrial species, such as documented for rabies virus in the US, remain key drivers in refinements to policy surrounding these important viral agents, as ‘cross-species transmission’ (CST) and maintenance events could occur in Europe as they have in the US. It is widely accepted that the viral glycoprotein (G) is fundamental to virus entry and that viral entry is fundamental to cell infection. We aim to combine molecular technologies, including novel bat cell culture, viral pseudotypes (developed in objective 1) and reverse genetics (developed through previous defra funding) to study lyssavirus cell susceptibility and the potential for species to species transmission. Where restrictions to infection are observed through growth in cell culture we aim to manipulate recombinant viruses using established reverse genetics technologies and attempt to identify regions of the glycoprotein responsible for cell entry. Alongside these studies, we wish to investigate areas of the glycoprotein that are involved in the induction of a protective immune response following vaccination and how these areas can be altered to confer immunity against differet lyssavirus phylogroups. To do this we will mutagenise both G pseudotyped virus particles and recombinant full length infectious clones to attempt to further define correlates of protection afforded by current rabies virus vaccines. Fundamentally, through investigating these aspects of the lyssavirus glycoprotein we wish to characterise potential receptor binding residues on virus glycoproteins and B cell epitopes to enhance our understanding of lyssavirus tropism and vaccinology. This work will be carried out in close partnership with scientists at UCL, FLI, SGH and CDC where extensive research collaboration is already in place."

The control of the disease comes at considerable cost to both health and veterinary authorities. Terrestrial rabies has been eliminated from Western Europe (with a limited number of exceptions) although it is still prevalent in many parts of the world, including Eastern Europe. The UK remains free of terrestrial rabies, due to specific legislation implemented to prevent importation of rabid animals and mechanisms in place to control the spread of disease should an introduction occur. However, there is a risk of re-introduction, and following an incursion, the successful execution of the rabies control strategy requires the rapid and accurate diagnosis and epidemiological analysis of the initial case(s). There also remains a low risk of spill over of rabies into terrestrial animals from bat populations within the UK, known to carry EBLV-2 (European Bat Lyssavirus Type-2). This study aims to inform control and prevention policies by 1) assessing the risk posed by rabies and other lyssaviruses emerging worldwide and 2) investigating the use of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) to improve our ability to respond appropriately in an outbreak scenario. The AHVLA holds one of the largest collections of lyssavirus isolates in the world. Information gained from this archive, supported by EU and Defra funding, is vital in our understanding of the epidemiology of these viruses both within the UK and globally. This project will build on the success of previous ROAME projects (SE0423 and SE0424) through which continued expansion of the archive has enabled the genetic and antigenic characterisation of over 2000 lyssavirus isolates and provided accurate epidemiological information on the global rabies situation. The ability of lyssaviruses to mutate rapidly makes the continued characterisation of circulating viruses essential. The investment of Next Generation Sequencing technology at AHVLA, coupled with our unrivalled lyssavirus repository, places us in an excellent position to determine the potential benefits of full genome sequence for outbreak samples and subsequently deliver genomic profiling during an outbreak if required. Rapid generation of the full genome of the first isolates in an outbreak should enable re-construction of transmission chains. This in turn, may enable informed responses to key policy issues during the outbreak, driving the implementation of the optimal control measures. Additionally, the NGS sequencing platform is an excellent tool to investigate the importance of viral heterogeneity (quasispecies) in epizootics, cross species transmission (CST) events and potential for adaptation to new hosts. In particular this should enhance our understanding of the risk of CST events from EBLV-2 currently circulating in UK bats. Finally we will investigate the correlates between virus antigenic and genetic diversity and the effectiveness of veterinary rabies vaccines against a newly detected, highly divergent lyssavirus."""

Rabies is one of many exotic wildlife diseases which threaten the UK. The OIE lists rabies, Echinococcus multilocularis and Trichinella infection as notifiable, amongst others. The current wildlife rabies contingency plan is very well developed, and has been repeatedly tested in numerous training exercises. This plan involves both the logistical aspects of eradication in wildlife and the predictive simulation modelling to enable a geographically specific contingency plan to be developed. The team responsible for putting the plan into action will be working on this research project to ensure the wildlife diseases contingency plan is refined, improved and broadened to include as many exotic diseases as possible. We propose that this work will progress in these two related areas to permit our current rabies response to be adapted for a more generic wildlife disease situation, as well as ensuring that the rabies contingency plan stays up to date. This will significantly increase our ability to respond to and control any wildlife disease incursion, and the ability to respond timely and proportionately will minimise any upstream costs to government and the taxpayer of new diseases becoming endemic. Additionally, this ability to minimise the time to disease eradication will reduce the time that businesses remain under official restrictions. The establishment and spread of the OIE listed diseases above will probably be heavily dependent on the urban fox density, since this is the greatest opportunity for introduction of infection, allied with the highest available densities. We propose to update urban fox density data by collaborating with ongoing studies. We also propose to refine all mammalian density estimates based on available systematic data collection to ensure that the underlying data for wildlife diseases are available. Computer modelling for exotic disease management is a growing area, and we plan to investigate the potential for eradication of exotic disease other than rabies."	"1.

It is an important pre-requisite for preparedness and rapid response. These risk assessments are typically complex and data-hungry, limiting the real-world applicability in the event of a novel disease outbreak. However, the European Union (EU) maintains a number of extensive and real time datasets. Further data on global presence of disease is available through datasets held by the OIE, WAHID. The objective of the project is to develop an overarching model to make rapid use of available metadata to identify pathways of potential risk for classes of disease transmission (e.g. vector borne). This framework will provide invaluable information for risk assessors in the first instances of a disease outbreak where typically information on imports and routes of entry and potential for spread is undertaken on a case-by-case basis. It will also allow for an objective and systematic evaluation to inform risk-based animal health and zoonotic surveillance activities, either generically or for specific diseases. The framework will be readily adaptable not only to specific disease hazards, but also to broad classes of disease, defined by their mode of transmission. To assure feasibility and focus, the project will group biological hazards into distinct mode-of-transmission classes and develop a case study for each. For the release assessment, relevant incidence data from exporting countries will be combined with trade data, air passenger information, road transport data, and vector movement to identify important trade/movement routes from relevant geographical regions. The exposure assessment will identify the potential spread of disease via competent vectors by member state and for exposure of domestic livestock and/or humans by population density mapping and be used to inform efficient surveillance designs. Encompassing all areas in the project will be a communication network, ensuring that the modelling work builds from previous work in this area and is fit to provide scientific support to decision makers. In the event of an incursion, risk management decisions are to be taken under significant time constraints.

Existing live classical swine fever virus (CSFV) vaccines, such as the C-strain viruses, provide a rapid onset of complete protection against the disease and viral transmission but pose problems in discriminating infected amongst vaccinated animals (DIVA), which is critical for eradicating a disease and for the resumption of international trade following a disease outbreak. DIVA vaccines, based on the E2 protein of CSFV have been licensed but the time required for this vaccine to protect animals means it is of questionable value under emergency outbreak conditions. As a result, there are considerable efforts being placed in laboratories around the world, to develop DIVA vaccines that can provide similar efficacy to the C-strain vaccine. Multiple strategies are being deployed including the generation of chimeric viruses, whereby CSFV genes encoding vaccine targets are incorporated into the related cattle virus, BVDV, and by genetically modifying CSFV by deleting genes implicated in disease or evasion of the immune system. The development of next-generation DIVA vaccines with an ability to provide rapid protection would benefit greatly from an understanding of the immunological mechanisms underlying the remarkable efficacy of the C-strain vaccine. This project will utilise a C-strain vaccine to understand (1) the early immune events triggered by the virus in the tonsil, which is the natural primary site of infection by CSFV, (2) the protective effector mechanisms, induced by vaccination, which are responsible for dealing so effectively with CSFV infection even after only a few days, and (3) the viral components that trigger these responses, since it is critical that they be considered in any future vaccine. The project will involve a broad range of methods from molecular biology and immunology to animal experiments that will attempt to dissect the processes involved in the induction of protective immune responses by live attenuated CSFV. Study of tonsils from vaccinated and challenged animals will inform experiments in the laboratory that will investigate the cellular interactions and their functional consequences. Micro-arrays, a technology that allows the simultaneous comparison of the expression of thousands of genes, will be applied to tonsils from vaccinated and infected animals to provide data that will underpin the quest for protective mechanisms. Cutting edge laser dissection and microscopy techniques will be used to examine the cellular interactions and responses in the tonsil in the days following vaccination and infection. These data will then inform experiments in the lab with defined cell populations that will aim to test hypotheses relating to the induction of the immune response by C-strain CSFV. The immunological effector mechanisms that actually confer rapid protection afforded by C-strain vaccines will next be investigated. Previous studies have implicated a role for killer T cells and T cells secreting an effector molecule, interferon-gamma (IFN-ã), but it is unclear which or both are required for protection. Using a C-strain vaccination and challenge regime we will determine the kinetics of virus-specific IFN-ã and killer responses, and determine how each response relates to the timing of clearance of the challenge virus. Studies will be conducted to determine the effects of IFN-ã on CSFV, either directly by inhibiting its growth or by activating killer cells. Direct evidence for the role of T cell populations including killer cells will be obtained through experiments that will attempt to deplete these cell populations from animals and to determine whether they still remain protected against CSFV. The final component of the project, aims to determine the viral proteins or peptides that are the targets of the protective T cell response. Knowledge of this is necessary to ensure that genetically attenuated or sub-unit DIVA vaccines include these regions. T cells from immune pigs will be used in an IFN-ã based screen of a peptide library spanning all CSFV proteins to rapidly define the relevant sequences. Computer analyses will subsequently be performed on the identified sequences to determine how conserved they are across CSFV isolates, since this is critical if a vaccine is to protect in the field. The results of this project will contribute to the development of improved DIVA vaccines and would improve strategies to control the spread of CSF and reduce the need for mass slaughter of infected and suspected contact pigs in future outbreaks. The knowledge gained will ultimately reduce suffering of animals, ensuring high standards of animal health and welfare. A reduction in disease losses and barriers to trade caused by CSF will contribute to securing the chain of food production for both the UK consumer and the pig industry"	"1.

This study offers the opportunity to address the variable threat of introduction and spread of NDV to multiple poultry species to ensure the UK remains free from this exotic disease. Biological data generated will provide information for risk based analysis to refine cost effective surveillance which will potentially result in improved threat detection. As a result, this will help to ensure a sustainable UK poultry industry and that food production as well as export opportunities are not compromised. Essentially, the funding of this work ensures the strong NDV research programme and specialisation remains, effectively underpinning and maintaining our capability to provide disease emergency response and expertise as the UK national laboratory. The mechanisms responsible for both the maintenance of virulent Newcastle disease viruses (NDV) in bird populations and emergence of virulence are not completely understood. The aim of this study is to explore factors that lead to the highly variable disease presentations observed in different species infected with NDV and ascertain if these factors contribute to the maintenance or emergence of virulence. Several reports suggest that the NDV V protein, a component of the NDV genome that is involved in blocking the host immune response, has a role in virus virulence and host specificity. It has also been demonstrated that the V protein is effective in blocking the immune response in a host specific manner and that mutated virus where the V protein was removed showed attenuated virulence for chickens. The possibility that this is one of the factors involved in variable disease presentation observed in different poultry species will be explored. In the proposed study, the hypothesis that the NDV V protein has a role in virulence and host restriction will be investigated. The genetic variability of the NDV genome will be established and the biological properties of selected viruses showing genetic variations in the V protein will be evaluated using a number of in vitro and in vivo approaches. The specific properties of the V gene variants will be evaluated in both wild type and variant or modified viruses."

FMD remains endemic in many countries in Africa and Asia. In addition, sporadic outbreaks of disease frequently occur in countries that are normally free from disease such as those recently in Japan, South Korea, Russia, and extensively in PR China. These outbreaks reinforce the concerns about how readily the disease can pass across international borders. FMD is difficult and expensive to control since the causative virus (FMDV) is highly contagious and spreads rapidly through susceptible animals. In the event of an introduction into the UK, successful control and eradication of FMD is dependent upon early recognition of infected animals to reduce the potential for onward transmission of the virus to cause subsequent outbreaks. Accurate tests that can detect FMDV, or FMDV-specific antibody in clinical material play central roles in these activities. The aim of this project is to maintain and improve laboratory-based diagnostic methods for FMD, as well as to continue to evaluate technologies that allow rapid testing to be achieved in the field or in regional laboratories. The focus of this new project will be to develop enhanced virological and serological tests for the diagnosis of FMD, to ensure that the routine diagnostic systems used within the FMD National Reference Laboratory are able to respond rapidly to the threats of FMD incursion into the UK. This proposal covers specific areas that represent key Defra priorities: (i) Molecular and serological tools for earlier detection of FMDV infected livestock (ii) Improved high through-put approaches to monitor and control FMD incursions (iii) Tests that can be used for rapid identification of infected animals as the basis for more targeted control, with a consequent reduction in the costs of FMD outbreaks (industry and government), and (iv) To provide an evidence base to support a future reduction in the length of time businesses remained under official restrictions Research themes will center on the development, evaluation and validation of assays that can detect the presence of FMDV (and can differentiate from other viruses causing vesicular diseases), or serological tests that can be used to identify animals that have been previously exposed to FMD, particularly those within a vaccinated population according to the EU Directive and Recommendations of OIE. In addition, improved methods will be developed to detect “carrier” animals that are associated with persistent replication of virus. Together, the outputs from this project will provide Defra with increased confidence in using such assays for diagnosis and surveillance in the event of future outbreaks of FMD, and provide tools that can be used in post-outbreak surveillance to regain FMD-free status in the UK."	"Objectives: 1. Virological tests, to detect FMDV in clinical or preclinical specimens collected from animals, including: a. Virus isolation in cell culture systems to propagate “live” FMDV (and other viruses causing signs of vesicular disease in cloven-hoofed livestock). b. Immunoassays such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) to detect FMD viral antigen in clinical specimens and material from cell culture tests. c. Molecular tests such as real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) to detect viral genome (RNA). 2. Serological tests, to recognise animals that have been previously exposed to FMDV (or FMDV vaccine) comprising: a. Immunoassays and cell-based virus neutralisation assays to detect antibodies against the structural proteins (SPs) of FMDV. b. Immunoassays to detect antibodies against the non-structural proteins (NSPs) of FMDV. c. Immunoassays that are targeted to recognise sub-clinically infected (and carrier) animals."

It was an aim of the NSP to reduce frequencies of the VRQ PrP gene allele in sheep, the allele associated with one of the main groups of scrapie strains. Indirectly this has resulted in an increase in the relative numbers of animals encoding ARQ alleles and which will support both atypical and classical scrapie, including strains which have similarities to BSE in Western blot pattern of disease related PrP. These BSE-like strains have in the past produced major concerns that BSE had infected sheep in national flocks and considerable work was required to demonstrate that, although some scrapie strains have BSE-like features, they are not BSE. CH1641 is the archetype of such BSE-like scrapie strains but others have been described throughout Europe. It is possible in the UK that CH1641-like strains could occur in a mixed infection with atypical scrapie, potentially causing BSE-in-sheep scares and but also possibly resulting in the emergence of a novel combined strain with unknown risks for animals and humans. It is important therefore to study CH1641 in more detail. Previous studies in this lab (SE1429 and SE1436) and elsewhere have observed the changing characteristics of BSE in mixed infections with scrapie in sheep, however it could be argued it is now more likely that CH1641-like classical scrapie strains might be found in mixed infections of sheep with atypical scrapie and nothing is known about this potential phenomenon or the risks developing from such a mixed infection. This proposal aims therefore to address the issue using both sheep and transgenic mice using standard strain typing methodologies to gain information on how mixed scrapie/atypical scrapie infection would appear to those conducting surveillance testing for sheep TSE infections. The benefits of this proposed study will be realised by increasing our understanding of how TSE strains interact under controlled conditions, particularly those ARQ-targetting strains likely now to predominate in the UK and Europe as a result of breeding against VRQ alleles. It is likely that novel strains will emerge following some kind of selection process during infections in sheep with PrP genotypes not normally affected by scrapie and/or when strains inadvertently interact in rare multiple infections of individuals or flocks. In order to be prepared to deal with emerging TSE strains in the future, this project will provide crucial and different information on strain interactions to that which we have already generated on mixed TSE strain infections for VRQ-targetting scrapie strains in sheep (SE1436) and mice (SE1429). These existing and completed projects will provide tissues for laboratory studies and contribute to minimising costs. Understanding of how ARQ targeting strains of TSEs interact will contribute to the primary objective (2.2) of Defra’s Livestock – TSE and ABP evidence plan 2011/12 which aims to cope with potential threats from new or re-emerging TSEs."

In 2007 the disease was restricted to sub-saharan Africa and Sardinia but in that year spread to Georgia in the Trans Caucasus region and from there to neighbouring countries including the Russian Federation. In Russia spread of ASF has been dramatic and the situation is now considered to be out of control, raising fears of further spread to other countries in particular the EU, Eastern Europe and China. Indeed the first introduction to Ukraine was reported in the summer of 2012. This project aims to improve tools to control ASF by following three complimentary objectives. The first objective is to collect data on the effectiveness of transmission between infected and naive pigs within pens and between pens which share the same air space. Quantitative data on virus excretions and environmental contamination will also be gathered. The experiments will be carried out using a virus isolate from the Caucasus as strains from this region and Russia represent the greatest threat of spread to the EU. These experiments will provide information for modelling the spread of disease and thus help focus control measures effectively. A vaccine is not available to protect pigs against ASF and this limits options for disease control. Our second objective will build on data from our previous project aimed at identifying those ASFV proteins which can induce a protective response in pigs. In our previous project we screened a wide pool of the more than 150 proteins ASFV codes for and identified 20 of those to focus on for vaccine development. In this project we will identify 5 proteins from these 20 which can induce protection. This smaller number of ASFV proteins could realistically be incorporated into a commercially produced vaccine. The third objective focuses on methods for diagnosis of ASF. The initial confirmation of an outbreak of ASF will require isolation of the virus in cell culture. Currently there is no established cell line available for ASFV isolation and growth. Instead primary cells have to be prepared for this purpose directly from pigs. We have obtained, through collaboration, a pig macrophage cell line and have shown that these can be infected by ASFV. In this project we will further validate the use of this cell line for diagnosis and growth of ASFV by comparing infection and virus growth rates in the cell line to those obtained in primary cells. Use of this cell line would offer a major advantage in terms of consistency of results, ease of obtaining cells and avoiding the use of animals."	"The overall objective of the project is to improve the tools available for control of African swine fever by completing three independent but complimentary objectives. 1 To obtain data on the effectiveness of different ASFV transmission routes for use in development of a disease transmission model. 2. To identify a pool of 5 ASFV antigens which induce protection in pigs for incorporation into virus vectored vaccines. 3.

The GB epidemic has been largely controlled by the ban on feeding ruminant-derived protein to ruminants introduced in July 1988 as evidenced by the peak infected birth cohort. However, by 1991 it was clear that the 1988 ban was not completely effective. The risk of exposure was further reduced by the ban on the feeding of mammalian protein to ruminants in 1994 and the ban on the feeding of mammalian meat and bone meal to farmed livestock in April 1996. However, these bans were again not completely effective due to the belief that there was still cross-contamination at very low levels, particularly associated with imported feed. In January 2001, the European Union banned the feeding of processed animal protein to farmed animals. Animals born after these two reinforced bans (1996 and 2001) are termed BARBs. There have been 174 such cases reported since 2000 which peaked in 2003 with 38 cases. Since then the number of BARB BSE cases have declined to single figures (2 in 2009, 5 in 2010 and so far there have been 3 cases in 2011). • The classical form of BSE is generally considered to have been caused by a single prion strain (C-BSE) but since 2003 at least two strain variants of cattle prion disorders have been recognized and classified as atypical forms of C-BSE (H-BSE and L-BSE) which show differences in vacuolation and molecular profiles to C-BSE. The two GB BSE cases detected in 2011 were born in 1998 and 1999 and have been reported as BARB L-BSE cases whereas all previous BARB BSE cases have been reported as C-BSE cases. • Although there are complete test data-sets for some BARB BSE cases, poor tissue condition and in some cases autolysis have largely ruled out complete comparisons with non-BARB BSE cases. Initially, In the Defra funded project SE2014, three samples were intracerebrally inoculated into 4 different mouse lines (AHVLA developed transgenic mouse lines, Tg(BoPrP)1896 and Tg(OvPrPAHQ) EM16, Tg bov 110 imported from Spain and the wild type RIII mice). One case is a BARB BSE case born in 1999 and two are cases both born in 2003. Approved extended objectives for SE2014 have resulted in two further BARB BSE cases born in 2004 being inoculated and the two BARB L-type BSE cases detected in 2011. • This present proposal is aimed at collecting more data for BARB BSE cases by extending the transgenic mouse inoculations to nine remaining BARBs, born between 1996 and 2000, and to six more BARB cases, three born in 2001 and three born in 2002, alongside three more C-BSE controls.

There is also a specific requirement for small ruminant positive samples to be further tested to determine if the strain of TSE present is bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) rather than scrapie, given that this strain is the only one currently known to be zoonotic. The age groups and total numbers of animals tested are modified based on the disease trends identified by this surveillance process, with the aim of reducing the overall cost of testing as outlined in the TSE roadmap 2, published by the European Commission and endorsed in general by Defra. However, within the last decade, as the numbers of BSE and scrapie cases have dropped dramatically, this active surveillance has identified atypical variants in both sheep (Nor98/atypical scrapie) and cattle (L-type BSE/bovine amyloidotic spongiform encephalopathy), and H-type BSE). While it has been proposed that these rare forms of disease are spontaneous, it has also been shown that transmission can be achieved experimentally into a range of host species (cattle, sheep, transgenic mice, primates) and there is evidence that the disease characteristics do not remain stable in some cases. Given that there is still no robust understanding of what makes a particular TSE isolate zoonotic, it is important that we have as broad an understanding and awareness of how such isolates present in food animal species, and how stable they are on inter- and intra-species transmission. They need to be characterised as fully as possible to assist with accurate detection and classification of these cases should they occur in field situations, and to underpin informed assessment of risk to both human and animal health. This is in keeping with one of Defra’s stated aims (in “Livestock - TSE and animal by products evidence plan 2011/12” ) that one of the highest research priorities is to ensure preparedness to detect and evaluate new or unusual TSEs. Emerging data from an existing Defra project investigating the disease produced by experimental infection of sheep with atypical BSE sources (SE1860) suggests that the clinical disease which results would not be considered as suspect TSE by current criteria, and although a positive diagnosis would be obtained through active surveillance, classification of the strain would be problematic using existing methods. However, experimental challenge of cattle (EU funded) resulted in retention of all diagnostic characteristics of the infecting strain. We propose to use material from these sheep and cattle studies to look at whether our existing bioassay techniques can still classify the agent strain, and whether the strains retain or lose specific identifying characteristics when they are passaged through cattle and sheep more than once. This will complement the data on the intra- and inter-species challenges being undertaken with atypical scrapie (SE1847 and separate study submitted for funding by Defra)"	"1.

The outbreaks of BTV-8 that occurred in the UK during 2007 demonstrated that BTV can cause serious disruption to ruminant trade and production. Later outbreaks of BTV-1 in northern France have additionally demonstrated that the BTV-8 incursion was not an isolated occurrence. While both these BTV strains have been eradicated across the EU using coordinated vaccination campaigns, there remains a need to be able to identify drivers that may influence epidemiological parameters of strains threatening the UK. In this project we examine the process of re-assortment of BTV genome segments in both the Culicoides and ruminant host with a view to identifying those factors that might influence the UK policy response to incursion (e.g. pathogenicity; transmission by northern European Culicoides; thermal requirements for replication). Secondly, we examine the potential for using novel technologies to investigate overwintering of BTV in the Culicoides host which may influence the probability of a given strain successfully persisting in the UK. All identified serotypes of BTV share a genome structure that allows exchange of segments following co-infection of host or vector cells, a process termed reassortment. Recent studies carried out by IAH and others have demonstrated that reassortment occurs in the field with far higher regularity than previously thought, having been largely overlooked prior to the advent of multi-segment sequencing of viruses. The importance of reassortment is that by exchange of genome segments, new progeny strains can be created which may inherit epidemiological characteristics from either parent strain. Our workplan will utilise entomology, virology and molecular biology to define the behaviour of BTV parental and reassortant strains in both ruminant hosts and Culicoides. This will provide information regarding the potential for policy relevant changes in the epidemiology of BTV strains following reassortant events including changes in primary vector species, adaptation to northern European temperatures and pathogenicity to livestock. It will also address fundamental questions of relevance in understanding the global distribution of BTV and the persistence of the virus in areas of incursion. The potential for transovarial overwintering of BTV in Culicoides has been investigated previously both in the USA and in the UK (the latter as part of a previous Defra funded project: SE2610). While live virus has never been isolated from progeny insects during previous experiments, the most recent studies used PCR-based techniques to demonstrate the presence of BTV proteins in larvae collected in the field in the USA. It was hypothesised that core particles of BTV were transmissible between life history stages and that this could be a novel form of overwintering for BTV. These field findings have not been confirmed using controlled laboratory studies. The confirmation or negation of transovarial transmission as an overwintering method through detailed studies will enable a narrowing of alternative scenarios in the event of a future incursion."	"1.

Despite this, the incidence of bTB breakdowns (i.e. herds in which movement restrictions are enforced due to suspected bTB infection) has increased dramatically over the past 30 years. Detection of some cases in slaughterhouses is important, in particular in areas where testing is only conducted on farms every four years. However, in the past couple of years the proportion of bTB breakdowns disclosed by slaughterhouse surveillance (as opposed to routine skin testing) has increased significantly. The reasons for this are not at all clear, and elucidating why these cases are being missed will provide important information, not only for policy makers trying to control the spread of the disease, but also to help improve our knowledge about the biological mechanisms involved in bTB spread, and how these interact with the routine testing structure. This project aims to tackle these issues in various ways. Although herds are tested routinely, it is not necessarily the case that individual animals are routinely tested. One possible reason why more cases are being disclosed at the SLH is if a higher proportion of infected animals are not being tested due to trade movements. We will determine what proportion of the increase in slaughterhouse detection might be due to differences in the degree to which animals are skin tested during routine surveillance and pre-movement skin testing. Our specific objectives include: 1) Collation and assessment of the utility of all available slaughterhouse data on bTB diagnoses, from a range of different sources, including the TB50 system, the TB System and the TB Laboratory Management System. We will also assess the utility of lesion data collected by the Food Standards Agency. 2) Identification of factors associated with detecting bTB by finding visible lesions in slaughterhouses using a detailed and longitudinal statistical framework. We will do this by linking all available current and historic cattle movement and testing datasets in order to extract demographic information, testing history and location/movement information of individual cattle. Dependent on the output of Objective 1, we will also combine this with more detailed slaughterhouse surveillance information. 3) Assessment of the degree of change in the level of undisclosed infection in the cattle population over time, using a longitudinal statistical transmission modelling approach. We will use this model to identify factors associated with the observed increase in the detection of infected cattle in slaughterhouses. We will account for the geographical and temporal variations in background incidence in these analyses, as this may drive many of the underlying patterns. If possible, we will evaluate the performance of some individual slaughterhouses over time. 4) We will use data that are available from slaughterhouses in order to determine risk factors for detecting bTB in other farmed livestock species, such as sheep, goats and pigs."	"1) Assessment and collation of all available slaughterhouse data, but with substantial focus on historical lesion data, currently held in three sources: the TB50 system (pre-2007), The TB System (2007–2010), and the Laboratory Management System (LIMS; post-2010). In addition, we will also assess the utility of the lesion data collected by the Food Standards Agency. 2) Identification of factors associated with disclosing bTB via visible lesions detection in slaughterhouses using a longitudinal statistical regression framework. We will do this by linking the CTS, Vebus/TBMaster and VetNet/SAM data sets in order to extract demographic information, testing history and location/movement information. Dependent on the output of 1, we will also combine this with more detailed slaughterhouse surveillance information. Repeated measures and explicit spatio-temporal structure will be incorporated using random effects. 3) Assessment of the degree of change in the level of undisclosed infection in the cattle population over time, using a longitudinal statistical transmission modelling approach. We will use this model to elucidate factors associated with the observed increase in slaughterhouse detection. The model will include an explicit spatio-temporal correlation structure in order to account for geographical and temporal variations in background risk-of-infection, which is critical in understanding the underlying data, and also (if possible) to monitor the performance of individual slaughterhouses over time. 4) We will use data from slaughterhouses to determine risk factors for detecting bTB in other farmed livestock species, such as sheep, goats and pigs."

"SE3247"	"Development of an oral BCG vaccine for badgers - regulatory component"	"http://randd.defra.gov.uk//Default.aspx?Menu=Menu&Module=More&Location=None&Completed=2&ProjectID=16213#Description"	"2010"	"2016"	"There was an estimated 225% increase in the number of bovine tuberculosis (TB) incidents in Great Britain between the years 1996 and 2006. This adversely affects animal health and welfare, and is a cause of considerable economic loss to farmers and Government. Although transmission of Mycobacterium bovis between cattle is an important factor in spread of the disease, the Eurasian badger (Meles meles) represents an additional wildlife source of recurrent M. bovis infection to cattle in both the UK and Ireland. Following the recent Ministerial statement that badgers would not be culled as part of control measures for bovine TB (http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/ministers/statements/hb080707.htm), the vaccination of badgers against TB has come to the fore as a possible means to reduce and control bovine TB alongside other control measures. It has long been recognised that delivery of vaccine in oral bait holds the best prospect for vaccinating badgers over a wide geographical area and has proved highly successful for mass vaccination of other wildlife species against rabies. In the short to medium term, M. bovis Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine represents the best available option for vaccination of badgers against TB. Options for the formulation of BCG in bait will be explored under a complementary research project. This project will focus on experimental work using the oral vaccine in order to generate data for the licensing of the vaccine. There are defined steps to achieve this as follows, and each of these requirements form part of this project: • Experimental safety study on captive badgers performed to Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) accreditation. • A field safety study on wild badgers performed to Good Clinical Practice (GCP). • Demonstration of the effectiveness of the vaccine to badgers in experimental infection studies. Another important element to this project and related to the safety of the vaccine, is assessment of the likelihood and consequences of exposure of non-target species to the oral bait vaccine. EU Directive 92/18/EEC requires that the potential risk to unvaccinated animals of the target or any other potentially exposed species shall be evaluated. The Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) will be responsible for evaluating the application to obtain a National Marketing Authorisation for the oral badger vaccine. The most significant non-target species from the perspective of TB control is cattle. There is a need to quantify and determine the risks associated with exposure of cattle to the badger bait vaccine in advance of decisions over whether to vaccinate badgers orally as part of TB control policy, and make recommendations about precautions that can be taken to reduce the risk. The first element of this process will be addressed in the complementary research project, where
